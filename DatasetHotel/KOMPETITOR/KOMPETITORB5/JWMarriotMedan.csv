"1.","Tona Shahbazi","76","2025-12-01","5","JW Marriott Medan is truly one of the best luxury hotels in the city. From the moment you walk in, the atmosphere feels elegant, clean, and very well-maintained. The staff are extremely professional, warm, and welcoming — they treat every guest with great respect and always offer help with a smile. The rooms are spacious, modern, and very comfortable, with big windows that give beautiful views of the city. The beds are soft, the linens are high-quality, and everything is spotless. The bathroom is also large and well-designed, making the stay feel even more relaxing. The hotel facilities are outstanding. The swimming pool and gym are clean and well-equipped, perfect for unwinding after a long day. The breakfast buffet is amazing, with a huge variety of fresh and delicious food from local and international cuisines. Everything is prepared with care and tastes wonderful. Overall, JW Marriott Medan offers luxury, comfort, and excellent service. It is a perfect choice for both business and leisure travelers who want a peaceful, high-quality stay in Medan. Highly recommended."

Every staff member went above and beyond to ensure my stay was comfortable and smooth. A special thank you to Lusiana in Housekeeping for keeping my room immaculate and accommodating my requests with a smile. Thanks to members of the management team, especially Bhari, Augustinus, and Johannes who provided outstanding service—whether it was quick turnarounds or special amenities, they delivered with professionalism and warmth. The dining experience was superb, thanks to the head chef, Angelica, Juli, Nia, Farid, Evelyn, Jess Lynn, Octavia, Pashir, and Andi in the Restaurant, who expertly handled my special dietary requests with care and efficiency. The food was delicious, and their personalized service made every meal enjoyable. Additionally, the door staff and front desk team were consistently kind, professional, and attentive, making check-in/out effortless and always greeting me with genuine hospitality. This hotel truly understands the needs of business travelers, offering luxury, efficiency, and a welcoming atmosphere. I highly recommend it and look forward to staying here again on my next trip! Outstanding service, impeccable stay—worth every star!"

Just have to make sure with the hotel to get a clean-smell linen. The service is excellent. My appreciation goes to Mr. Julian who sent me a coconut water when he knew that there’s a problem with my stomach at a time. Also to Ms. Susi who asked me if I was okay when we met afterwards. They really took care of me. It’s easy to order food delivery, if you don’t opt for the room service. The cocktail time in the executive lounge is nice, there’s enough food for a light dinner. All the staffs there are nice people."
"4.","lancar jayadi sutanto","17","2025-12-01","5","I was genuinely pleased to be warmly welcomed back by Ms. Yuni at the reception and Mr. Julian, the Room Director, upon my arrival at JW Marriott Medan. They both greeted me kindly and even remembered that I had previously stayed at the property, with my last visit being in 2022 — which made me feel truly valued as a returning guest. They informed me that my Ambassador Suite was not yet ready since the previous guest (with a similar status) had just checked out. They even offered me a temporary room to wait in, but I told them I didn’t mind waiting at the lounge. Surprisingly, after just about five minutes of waiting, Mr. Julian personally came over to inform me that my suite was ready and handed me the room keys himself. Although I had been informed earlier via email that I wouldn’t receive an upgrade due to full suite occupancy, I could clearly see that both Ms. Yuni and Mr. Julian went the extra mile to make my stay pleasant and memorable. Truly top-notch service — thank you, Ms. Yuni and Mr. Julian! Minor suggestion: perhaps the lounge could use a few more chairs or some décor in the center area to make it feel more welcoming. The air-conditioning could also be improved, as it was slightly warm and made it difficult to stay too long. Overall rating: 8.5/10 Thank you so much, JW Marriott Medan, for the warm hospitality — I truly appreciate the attention and effort from the team! Warm regards, Lancar Jayadi Sutanto"
"5.","Daniel Saputra","5","2025-12-18","2","Wonderful staff, well maintained hotel, but I was surprised by how unsustainable the hotel is! Ironic as there were posters everywhere about sustainability but they served plastic bottles in the rooms, the gym, also during events- very surprised that a hotel at this scale is still so wasteful in 2025. Hope you all can make positive changes! ♻️"
"6.","Ros Dewi","16","2025-12-01","1","Baru pertama x kecewa dibuat hotel bintang 5???! Perihal breakfast yg hanya disediakan utk 1org saja krn sy tidak mengubah jumlah tamu di aplikasi tiket.com pada saat booking kmar? Wowww tidak sekalian saja sy hanya diijinkan masuk 1 tamu 1 kmar sesuai pesanan sy diaplikasi? Ini pengalaman pertama hanya diberikan 1 BF utk kmar yg sy booking, padahal sy sering melakukan pemesanan di hotel bintang 5 lainnya dan dgn booking yg sama yakni 1 tamu dan tidak pernah dimasalahkan oleh pihak hotel dan selalu diberikan Breakfast utk 2 tamu, mau di Medan, luar kota, bahkan luar negri. Karna setau sy umumnya Hotel menyediakan Breakfast utk 2 tamu per kamar standart. Dan kmar yg sy pesan adalah type Deluks King, bukan kamar paling murah atau kmar single, yg jelas2 utk 2 tamu per kamar. Worth it kah BF hanya utk 1 tamu? Begitu kakunya kah hotel bintang 5 yg mengikuti jumlah angka di aplikasi yg bahkan mau diinput 1 atau 2 tamu harga per kamar dgn 1 atau 2 sarapan tetap sama harganya, tidak ada bedanya 1 sen pun. Dan krn ini sy hrus byar extra 1 BF lg utk 1 org seharga ratusan ribu, wawww pdhl bru bulan lalu sy inap di hotel bintang 5 lainnya di Medan dgn case yg sama sy hanya input 1 tamu krn sy tdk pernah ubah2 lg, dan tidak ada mslh sy tetap makan dgn suami dan anak sy. Akan sy maklumi apabila terdapat perbedaan harga untuk 1 atau 2 tamu, dan masalahnya disini adalah TIDAK ADA PERBEDAAN HARGA. Sy ingin merayakan anniversary sy hari ini dan baru juga check in sy sudah diberikan bad experience, Thank you JW Medan, never coming back again. 1.9jt for 1 Breakfast👍👍"

"8.","roland brown","19","2025-12-01","5","This has been my 3rd visit to Marriott in Medan. The rooms are well-maintained with a good view. All the hotel staff are so friendly and professional. I need to mention one waiter Theo. He has the art to remember his guests and can anticipate their wishes. Always serving with a smile, he is a good asset and has so much potential in the hospitality industry."
"9.","Yessa Rizkya","1","2025-12-18","5","Hotel yg mempunyai layanan yg menarik . Staff nya pada ramah dan sopan semua 🙏😊 terutama untuk staff penjaga kolam dan gym kalau ga salah namanya pak wahyu terimakasih sudah mengucapkan selamat atas wedding saya dan suami 🙏😊"
"10.","Andri R","22","2025-12-01","5","Visited Medan for the first time for my sister’s wedding and stayed at JW Marriott Medan. To summarise I am beyond impressed with the level of service I received. It’s not often these days that you find genuine hospitality and care, but JW Marriott reminded me that this art is not lost. Upon arrival, we were assigned a room that unfortunately felt exceedingly humid, the carpet, bedsheets, and sofa were damp, which was concerning since I was travelling with two young children. I raised the issue with Dini, the Room Manager, and to my surprise, the team immediately upgraded us to a much larger, spotless room at no additional cost. They even sent us complimentary cakes along with a sincere apology. At breakfast the next morning, Julian, the Director of Rooms, personally waited for us to finish before checking in to ensure we were comfortable and happy with the new room. Throughout our five-day stay, he continuously followed up with me not in a scripted way, but with genuine care. Even our cleaner (my apologies for forgetting the name) left a handwritten thank-you note, which was such a warm and thoughtful touch. The attention we received felt truly personal, I never felt like just another guest. While no hotel is perfect, what truly matters is how they respond when things aren’t right. In that regard, JW Marriott Medan went above and beyond. If I ever return to Medan, there’s no doubt I’ll be staying here again. Highly recommended for anyone who values sincere hospitality and exceptional service."
"11.","Aprilianti Novi86","3","2025-11-01","5","Saya ingin menyampaikan ucapan terima kasih yang sebesar-besarnya kepada Bapak Erwin dan seluruh tim JW Marriott Medan atas pelayanan yang luar biasa selama kami sekeluarga menginap baru-baru ini. Ini merupakan pertama kalinya kami menginap di JW Marriott Medan, dan sejak awal hingga akhir masa menginap, kami benar-benar merasakan keramahan, perhatian, dan profesionalisme dari seluruh staf hotel. Secara khusus, saya ingin menyampaikan apresiasi mendalam kepada Bapak Erwin, yang dengan penuh dedikasi dan ketulusan mendampingi kami dari proses check-in hingga check-out. Bapak Erwin selalu hadir membantu, memberikan informasi, dan memastikan kenyamanan kami setiap saat. Kehadiran beliau membuat kami merasa sangat diperhatikan, aman, dan nyaman selama berada di hotel. Kami juga ingin mengucapkan terima kasih kepada Bapak Johannes atau Bapak Ari, serta seluruh staf concierge, staf restoran, dan staf front office, yang semuanya melayani kami dengan senyum, keramahan, dan kehangatan yang tulus. Saya, orang tua saya, dan anak saya sangat senang dan berkesan dengan pengalaman menginap kali ini. Bahkan, kami sekeluarga besar yang berjumlah 13 orang menikmati dinner bersama di restoran hotel, dan semuanya merasa puas dengan cita rasa makanan, suasana, serta pelayanan yang begitu profesional namun tetap hangat dan kekeluargaan. Pengalaman ini menjadi momen indah yang akan selalu kami kenang. Kami benar-benar merasakan makna dari pelayanan khas JW Marriott yang berkelas dan penuh ketulusan. Terima kasih telah membuat kunjungan kami ke Medan terasa begitu istimewa. Semoga Bapak Erwin dan seluruh tim JW Marriott Medan senantiasa diberikan kesehatan, kesuksesan, dan semangat untuk terus memberikan pelayanan terbaik bagi setiap tamu. Kami pasti akan kembali lagi di kesempatan berikutnya dan dengan senang hati merekomendasikan JW Marriott Medan kepada keluarga dan teman-teman kami. Sekali lagi, terima kasih yang sebesar-besarnya kepada Bapak Erwin dan seluruh tim JW Marriott Medan atas segala perhatian, keramahan, dan pelayanan yang luar biasa."
"12.","Calistra","29","2025-10-01","5","Had a great stay at JW Marriott Medan! The service was excellent (a solid 9/10) and the gym was one of the highlights of my stay—really well-equipped and spacious. The room itself was comfortable and spacious, though the amenities were a bit hit or miss at times. Location-wise, the hotel is in a good spot, but Medan as a city just isn’t the most walkable area as in not safe for walks, so keep that in mind. Overall, a very good experience and definitely one of the best hotel options in Medan!"
"13.","Sunshine chaay","2","2025-12-01","5","I recently stayed 3 nights at the Medan JW Marriot hotel for the first time. (2638) Its good to experience the same consistent high service standards as in some Marriot hotel elsewhere. One incident stood out for which I am very grateful. Unfortunately I left my hp behind in the hotel and discovered only when I was checking in at the airport. Ibu Shanty was proactive in contacting us. Ibu Tety from housekeeping had earlier found my phone. Ibu Shanty took the initiative to have my phone sent to me at the airport just in time for my flight, stressing the urgency to the driver. The care, concern and professional handling of the whole matter left me pleasantly stunned as I was prepared to take the next flight home. I am deeply appreciative. Terima Kaseh, Ibu Shanty Dan Ibu Tety. Your kindness and thoughtful act left me very impressed and grateful"
"14.","San Yos","49","2025-11-01","3","The hotel location is good. The size and facilities are met up to standards. However the rooms really do need to be updated. Also the staffs service needs a lot of improvement. I do understand that i should have not expect the same standards as in Jakarta or Surabaya. However an improvement of services especially for a 5 stars hotel will benefit everyone."
"15.","Marian Allmannsberger","10","2025-11-01","4","The rooms were clean and spacious, and the staff were very kind and exceptionally helpful. Breakfast was good, just as you would expect from a hotel in this price range. The only disappointment was the spa – it felt dirty, old, and had a rather strange atmosphere. I actually left after just a few minutes."
"16.","Andy Wijaya","286","2025-08-01","5","Staying at JW Marriott Medan was a truly exceptional experience. From the moment I stepped into the grand lobby, I was welcomed with warm hospitality and professional service. The check-in process was smooth and efficient, setting the tone for a relaxing and enjoyable stay. The rooms were spacious, elegantly designed, and offered breathtaking views of the city. I especially appreciated the attention to detail — from the plush bedding to the well-stocked amenities that made my stay feel both luxurious and comfortable. The housekeeping team maintained everything impeccably throughout my visit. One of the highlights was the breakfast buffet, which featured a wide variety of local and international dishes. The restaurant staff were attentive and friendly, always ensuring guests were well taken care of. I also had the chance to unwind at the pool and fitness center — both well-maintained and perfect for a short escape from a busy day. Overall, JW Marriott Medan exceeded my expectations in every aspect. Whether you’re traveling for business or leisure, it’s a top choice for a refined, comfortable stay in the heart of the city. I would gladly return and highly recommend it to others seeking premium service and comfort."
"17.","Himanshu Timbadia","9","2025-12-18","5","Another Great Stay at the JW Marriott Medan!! Excellent service throughout the hotel, but the following truly stand out for serving with so much warmth: - Dini - is always there with her warm welcome and making sure that all aspects of my stay is comfortable - Valencia - at the executive lounge for her outstanding service and ensuring that the best vegetarian meals were prepared for me Hope to be back soon to experience the wonderful hospitality!!"
"18.","junior yeo","78","2025-12-18","5","What I like: Good city view, well equipped gym, very convenient location to shopping centers, good security, friendly staff What I don't like: Food is so so, rooms are about dated but it's still one of the best in that area, lighting is poor, can be noisy at times"
"19.","Desi Tarigan","72","2025-12-25","4","Kesini utk dinner saja yg ayce Tapi utk rasa kurang ya dan variasi makanan juga kurang banyak Utk pelayanan semua staf ramah2"
"20.","noni sinta","7","2025-10-01","4","sudah dua kali menginap disini. overall saya suka. saran saya, untuk sekelas hotel bintang 5, tolong dong tvnya diganti jadi smart TV. karena hotel2 kecil aja skrg udah smart TV semua. terus regulasi pengantaran makanan dr abg2 ojol, tolong diperhatikan dan jangan dipersulit. itu juga bagian dari kenyamanan tamu."
"21.","Amorna Mimoss","1","2025-11-01","3","The food was good, but the service could be improved. The staff were not very responsive, and there was a time when I had to repeat my order just to get hot water and coffee. Hopefully, the service will be better in the future."

Memalukan sekali !!!!!!!!!!!"
"24.","Isaac","22","2025-11-01","5","The service is definitely top notch which compensates on some of the room amenities which could be slightly dated and can be polished. It’s definitely one of the best hotel services I have experienced so far. Would visit again if I come back to Medan"
"25.","Liza Nurulfazila OK Rahmat","10","2025-10-01","4","Kind of dissapointed. The breakfast was not good. Many choice but not tasty. The staff at the entrance was like unwelcoming. It took too long for the porter to come. We went out in the morning and came back around 3 pm, the room was not made-up and rubbish wasn't collected yet. Usually hospitality in Indonesia is top notch, but sad to say not in this hotel. Hopefully they improve."
"26.","Crystal Ng","82","2025-10-01","1","I’ve been staying at this hotel for two nights, and unfortunately, my experience has been quite challenging. The pillow in the room is very flat and uncomfortable, making it hard to get a good night’s sleep. What’s even more frustrating is the noise. The hotel’s soundproofing is really poor, and even at 12:49 AM, there’s still a loud party going on. The noise is extremely disturbing and has made it nearly impossible to rest properly. While the location and other aspects of the hotel are decent, I think improvements in soundproofing and offering more comfortable pillows would really enhance the guest experience."
"27.","Thanakorn Alfandari","78","2025-09-01","5","Right in the centre not far from Soho and the railway station. The hotel was very comfortable but service was somewhat lacking given its five stars status. The lounge staff didn't have a clue about the cigars on display. The shower in the room also didn't stop dripping despite my best attempt to get the dial to the close position. Very comfortable bed though."
"28.","Bambang Pamukas","15","2025-10-01","1","Buruk... Aku kurir antar makanan mau nitip ke kamar sekian macam di telantarkan. Sok sibuk padahal gk rame kali padahal.

"32.","donel courtney","18","2025-09-01","5","I really liked the vibe here. The rooms all have views, they're large, location is in the middle of town. The food is great, the in-room dining and Chinese restaurant were super tasty and affordable (to me). Its just so friendly here. Daniel at the concierge was helpful in going beyond protocol for me and Evelyn at the Chinese restaurant was just a delight in recommending food and just being charming to a solo traveller."
"33.","Robyn Huang","1082","2025-08-01","5","My family and I had an exceptional stay at this hotel for two nights before and after a jungle visit. The rooms are comfortable and clean, with big bathtubs and the staff were just wonderfully sweet and kind. Our daughter loved the shallow children’s pool. It’s just a gem of a hotel."
"34.","Brandon Thompson","59","2025-08-01","5","What a great hotel in the heart of Medan, Indonesia. Bed was super comfy and blinds closed to near darkness which was important after battling the 11 hour jet lag for a day. Breakfast option is absolutely amazing. The states don’t have breakfast options this nice. Good coffee and some tasty world food options. Everything you would want. It felt safe and it was kept in immaculate condition. I review tons of hotel rooms and this is one of the top 5 I’ve ever been in."
"35.","Sharky Oks","207","2025-08-01","5","Hotelnya mewah guys, tempatnya di tengah Kota Medan. Untuk kamarnya bersih dan harum, tapi sepertinya hotel lama ya, dibeberapa bagian dinding di lorong kamar untuk wallpapernya sudah bergelombang sepertinya perlu pembaharuan deh🙏. Pengamannya juga ok ya guyss…naik ke atas juga perlu kartu akses juga. Nah untuk sarapan, menunya variatif dan enak” guysss….untuk harga sih menyesuaikan ya guys menengah keatas. Pengalaman yg tak terlupakan kok…."
"36.","siagianxena","2","2025-08-01","5","At first, I contacted the reservation team for two full days and received no response, so I left a negative review and initially decided not to stay here. However, in the end, I decided to book two rooms for one night and was finally assisted by the reservation team (This case has been resolved and the apology was accepted after they responded to my review) All payments were handled smoothly, even though I’m currently in the U.S., I was able to make the booking easily for my sibling’s graduation in Indonesia. All of our requests were fulfilled, and even with several reschedule requests, we were not charged any extra fees. Thanks for that The check-in process for my family went smoothly. Although one room was not ready at the time, everything else went well, and my family was very happy. We had a special request for a graduation message written on the mirror, and it was beautifully done. Thank you so much to the team (especially Grace) who decorated the room, and to the pastry team for the lovely cake. The rooms were spacious, with a connecting door, a clean bathroom, beautiful views, and excellent service. The staff always smiled warmly whenever my family passed by. The lounge area was spacious with a great variety of food and an amazing view. The swimming pool was great, and there was also a gym. Breakfast had a wide variety of options, though some items like bread and Jam were placed separately in a different area, which could be improved for better convenience. Just a small suggestion. At check-out, there was a bit of confusion when the reception mentioned that the booking was originally for a Deluxe room and had been upgraded to an Executive room, which made my family a little confused. But it was explained clearly in the end, and the staff apologized for the misunderstanding. When exiting the parking lot, my family were charged Rp 25,000, which was fine, but maybe it would be helpful if parking registration procedures were explained during check-in, since not everyone is aware of this policy. Overall, great service. Best of luck to the JW Marriott team. my entire family was happy with the stay"
"37.","Raisya Maharani","189","2025-11-01","5","Bintang tidak berbohong. Semua layanan, keramahan staff, fasilitas hotel memuaskan. Makanan enak. Lokasi strategis sekali"
"38.","Zubaidah Ismail","6","2025-07-01","5","I had a truly pleasant first-time experience staying at JW Marriott. The hotel was very clean and located in a strategic area. Service at the reception was excellent, especially from the Front Office Manager. Special thanks to Ms. Devita from the F&B team at The Lounge — she was efficient, friendly, and made guests feel at ease. Overall, the service was truly first-class. Thank you to the entire JW Marriott team for the outstanding hospitality."
"39.","Daniel Hendrata","19","2025-08-01","5","I stayed here many times since 2016 or 2017. This hotel is definitely aging. But for me still considered one of the best hotels in Medan. Love their breakfast, gym: best lifefitness hardwares, the sauna and cold plunge is definitely assets and plus points as not many hotels would have these anymore. They are very responsive to the guest needs. Mattress quality is also great and plus points. Rooms for improvement: - Better pillow. Its very soft. I asked for firm and came another soft pillow. - new carpets - seal rubber at the windows as the building is aging then we could easily hear the motor cycle racing muffler from outside, especially at night and some loud disco music from other premises. Plus points: I accidentally left a pair of clothes and they initiated to contact me and offer solutions. Keep up the great work."
"40.","J B","183","2025-12-01","2","Not worthy of the JW Marriott brand Very poor service and incompetent staff Rooms are decent while a little dated Over priced food and beverage Below average food Exceptionally inefficient and incompetent check in and check out Have stayed three times and 2/3 was j recharged and still waiting fir a refund. Duffy credit card procedures at front desk Avoid this hotel, find somewhere else"
"41.","Brendan Crozier","16","2025-09-01","4","This hotel was very pleasant, especially for the price and given the location. I stayed for 3 nights in total in two different rooms (over two occasions, either end of a 10 day tour of Northern Sumatra). On the first occasion they upgraded me to the executive room (I think that's what it was called). I didn't realise and was quite surprised when I opened the door. It was enormous, with huge windows on two sides. It was very luxurious, though facing what I suspect was North-West the air-conditioning struggled to keep up with the heat from the sun on the windows. Despite being on 16 degrees the room never got below 26, even in the morning. It was warm, but bearable and still comfortable. Air-con in Indonesia seems a little different from other tropical countries I've been to. It takes the edge off, but certainly doesn't make the room cool. The second room I stayed in, which was much more standard (but still fairly spacious and very comfortable) coped much better, and the temperature was lower. The location was great, right across the road from a big shopping centre. The food court inside was excellent, with lots of good quality local food. There is also a supermarket just around the corner for basic needs. It's walking distance to places like the Chinese mansion, and the Sunday markets. The facilities are good, but just barely scraping by. The sauna was great, but the mechanism was variable, with the temperature being over 100 degrees on the first day (I've honestly never been in a sauna that is so hot, and I've been in a lot of saunas; the thermostat seemed stuck on). The other days it was a much more normal 60-70 degrees. Either way I got a good sweat up. The spa was lukewarm (board said it was 40 degrees; it was not. More like 35). The steam room was being repaired. The plunge pool was fantastic. Freezing, and probably the coldest thing in all of Sumatra 😊! It was wonderful after having a good sweat. Some of the other patrons didn't understand the basic courtesy of showering after the sauna and before the spa/plunge/pool, so you're kind of swimming in people's sweat. Some multilingual instructions might be helpful? The tiles were unfortunately treacherous; maybe some grip strips need to be installed? I almost stacked it several times as I aquaplaned across the floor. The gym was great. Excellent new equipment and a really nice space. The staff were very friendly, giving a towel and bottle of water each time you worked out. They even remembered my name even though I was only there a couple of day. The breakfast was nice enough, with some gluten free options (I have coeliac). Bizarrely, although they had some little GF cakes, there was no GF bread. Probably consider getting the bread before other types of pastry. Overall the hotel was pretty nice, but a little old, tired and in need of some more aggressive renovations in the sauna area, but still functional and clean. Like everywhere in Sumatra you need to drop 1 or 1.5 stars to get a sense of what the place is actually like (i.e. it's really more of a 4 star hotel, despite technically ticking the boxes for that rating). It's still probably the nicest hotel in the city."
"42.","Matthew Reichel","196","2025-08-01","5","We loved our two stays here— it’s a great value place with really caring staff who go above and beyond to help. Rooms are really comfortable and gym/pool area is great. Very child friendly."
"43.","Widodo Krisman","15","2025-07-01","5","Love the location of this brand, very convenient with city center. The breakfast is exquisite, the staff service was true to its 5 stars rating. The hotel and facility are a bit old but still classy, best of all, maintained well. The pool area is showing its age, however, still has the best view of City of Medan."
"44.","Soegianto Ali","381","2025-10-01","5","Located in the middle of the city across Deli Park Mall. The room is big enough, and clean. The power outlets is smart, they have a number of possible slot but since it is located on the table, no matter what your power plug is, it stand securely to the outlet."

"47.","Emma H. Cahyani","9","2025-07-01","5","My fiancé and I had an amazing 3-night stay at JW Marriott Hotel in Medan! We were fortunate to receive an upgrade to one of the top-tier rooms. The room was spacious, elegant, and incredibly comfortable, and the complimentary breakfast was a fantastic way to start each day. We also celebrated my birthday at the restaurant. They staff went above and beyond to make our dinner special. The hotel’s location is in the city center, making it convenient to explore nearby malls and book a rideshare. One minor inconvenience was that, on one morning, the breakfast area was extremely crowded due to a political party gathering. Many guests from the event stood in the walkways, chatting, which made it difficult to move around comfortably.

"49.","Matthew Loh","32","2025-06-01","5","Menginap 2 malam di kamar deluxe. Secara kesimpulan, hotel bagus dan mewah, tetapi ada rekomendasi yang harus diperhatikan. Saya perhatikan banyak penggunaan botol plastik terlebihan. Di gym dan kamar, setiap pengunjung diberikan botol air plastik. Di seluruh hotel, hanya ada dispenser air di seberapa tempat seperti lantai gym dan kolam renang. Saya saran untuk tambah dispenser air minum di setiap lantai dekat lift, dan berikan air di kamar dengan pesan untuk mengurangi penggunaan plastik dan melestarikan lingkungan. Ada banyak hotel bintang 3 dan 4 yang tidak sekelas tinggi seperti JW Marriot tetapi sudah ada kebiasaan ini. Jadi menurut saya ini sangat mengejutkan. Selain itu, di kamar mandi ada kurang rak untuk gantung pakaian atau handuk, hanya ada bebarapa batang kecil sesuai untuk handuk kecil. Biasanya di hotel, di atas kloset toilet ada rak untuk gantung handuk. Tetapi di toilet ini ada bingkai lukisan seni. Sarapan pagi prasmanan sangat lezat dan ada banyak pilihan. Kamarnya sangat luas dan nyaman, ada layar TV sangat modern. Jadi saya rekomendasikan tempat ini untuk siapapun yang ingin mengalami hotel yang mewah dan nyaman di Medan."

My special thanks to Shanti for her friendliness, helpfulness and her sense of humour. She really brighten our stay each day. Last but not least, there is this lady I want to specially thank is Maida, the masseuse. She is such a skilful massage therapist. All my tension and body ache was relieved and because her technique was good, I ended up having her doing 3 days massage for my 3N stay. I definitely will be back to JW Marriott with my family again.

The room may have mid 2000s decor but looks kept well, nice art and paneling, with tiled floor to ceiling bathroom. I got an upgraded executive room with a king bed and a lot of space to walk around. King bed was more firm so I woke up with light shoulder pain, beds in Indonesia are generally stiffer. The bathroom was big too with a large soaker tube and walk in shower, and even electric roller window shades. I received two random gifts from the staff, including some welcome pastries and fruit, then some more pastries like macarons and cakes later in the stay. That and the handwritten notes were a very nice touch. I requested numerous bottles of water throughout the stay, used the fridge in the room, and also did a later checkout. Appreciate this team for being so accommodating in this trip. Location is central, right in front of one of the best looking malls in the area (Podomoro)."

Range pilihan appetizer, menu utama sampai desserts nya sangat terbatas. Saya dan keluarga datang untuk ocassion khusus di ruang VIP tapi pilihan makanan nya terlalu sedikit. Ini bukan kali pertama saya dan keluarga menikmati buffet dinner di Marriot Cafe, tapi kali ini sangat kecewa dan merasa dirugikan.

"92.","謝文良Tjia Roberto","9","2025-01-01","5","Staf untuk breakfast tanggal 23 April 2024 sekitar jam 08:00 di restoran sangat aneh. Atau mungkin kebijakannya yg aneh. Saya dari kamar 1929 untuk sarapan harus meninggalkan nama dan nomor handphone, padahal jelas saya pegang kartu kunci kamar. Nomor handphone itu privasi, tidak bisa asal dikasih ke orang, paham? Staf hotel berkelas tinggi tapi kok logikanya tidak jalan hanya demi taat prosedur, hanya karena nama saya tidak tertera di list breakfast. Nama saya tidak tertera karena memang bukan saya yg pesan kamar hotel, tapi kan saya yg menginap di kamar itu, ada bukti kunci kamar juga. Kalau saya tidak bisa tunjukkan kunci kamar ya silahkan dicegat. Saya juga tahu diri kali, Bos. Kalau saya tidak nginap di hotel ini ngapain saya breakfast di sini. Saya bukan pengemis miskin, paham? Kalian pikir saya sengaja rapi2 pake batik, pake sepatu dinas, pake tas ransel isi laptop berat-berat hanya untuk nyamar dan breakfast gratis di hotelmu? Mikir pake otak. Silahkan dicek di profile Google saya, sudah biasa saya menginap di hotel berbintang 4-5, ngga pernah sekalipun dipersulit hanya untuk breakfast. Dungu kalian. (Review sebelumnya ini tetap saya pertahankan agar tetap jadi pembelajaran buat kita semua, termasuk buat saya, karena saya juga bukan manusia sempurna) Terimakasih kepada Pak Tito Priyatna, sebagai manager, atas penyelesaian masalahnya dengan sangat baik. Saya ditanyai langsung mengenai permasalahan yang dirasakan dan beliau minta maaf kepada saya. Komunikasi dan gesture dilakukan dengan sangat baik. Saya yakin Mba waitress yang saya maksud di atas juga berniat baik, demi keamanan untuk hotel juga. So no hard feeling to whoever you are, Mba, saya juga tidak ingat wajahnya seperti apa. Ngga ada dendam. Melalui perbaikan review ini saya juga mohon maaf atas pemilihan kata-kata tertentu yang kasar. Saya yakin dalam konflik apapun tidak ada pihak yang bebas dari kesalahan, saya pun juga harus bercermin. Kesalahan kecil tidak merusak suasana saya menginap di hotel ini secara keseluruhan, ruang kamar sangat baik, fasilitas di kamar sangat baik, makanan sangat baik, the best egg benedict i ever had. Staf semuanya ramah. Again, thank you for nicely accepting my criticism and for reaching me out. Best regards."

"95.","Andy Lee","82","2025-03-01","5","Here’s a detailed English version of your experience: --- A 5-Star Experience at JW Marriott Medan I recently had the pleasure of staying at JW Marriott Medan for one week, and it was an unforgettable 5-star experience thanks to the exceptional service provided by the staff. From the moment I arrived, I was treated with utmost care and attention to detail. A special mention goes to Mrs. Susi Lestari, the Assistant Front Office Manager, who ensured every aspect of my stay was smooth and seamless. Mr. Louis stood out with his thorough and detailed explanation of the hotel suite, making sure I was well-informed and comfortable. Mr. Eno impressed me with his sharp memory and attentiveness to guests, creating a personal and warm atmosphere. At the front office, Rianty delivered outstanding service, effortlessly fulfilling all my room preferences and ensuring every detail was just right. In addition, Angelyn and Valencia, who served me at the Lounge on the 16th floor, provided impeccable service, making my time there truly enjoyable. The staff's professionalism and friendliness made this stay a truly delightful experience.A big thanks for the other staff too. While the hotel's facilities might not match the standards of other JW Marriott hotels globally, it is undoubtedly the best hotel in Medan. However, one critique I have is the parking situation, as the lot is frequently full and lacks a dedicated space for hotel guests. On a brighter note, the breakfast was excellent, offering a wide variety of dishes, including delicious local specialties, which were prepared and served to perfection. It added a wonderful local touch to my stay. Overall, staying at JW Marriott Medan was a highly satisfying experience, and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone visiting the city. The service quality truly sets it apart, making it a memorable visit."

Apparently they also mean a lot at the JW Marriott as attention to detail was noticeable throughout the property. The entire front service staff was gracious and welcoming. The Bellman were always present at the curbside, greeting customers and promptly and efficiently handling luggage. I never had to open the door when going in and out as staff was always present to do so. The front office staff was prompt and efficient and made me feel like a welcome guest. We dined at the buffet for breakfast and dinner as well as prime steakhouse. Staff was cordial, attentive, and professional. Buffets were abundant and well maintained. Food was attractively presented, fresh, and delicious. I was also impressed with the high level of cleanliness, and the overall excellence of the housekeeping staff. Public areas were consistently well maintained and spotless, as was our guest room, which had a large variety of amenities. The fitness center featured over 20 new Life Fitness machines. They included aerobic and weightlifting machines. There were also free weights and a stairmaster. Every machine had a bottle of water. There was also a dispenser of cucumber water.I was also presented with a bottle of water and a towel upon entering. There was also an outdoor swimming pool sauna and steam room. They might be more expensive than other hotels however, completely worth it. I will stay in no other place in Medan now that I’ve been spoiled by the JW Marriott."

Saya merasa kecewa terhadap pelayanan hotel Anda, jadwal check in di jam 3 sore seharusnya. Akan tetapi, sampai dengan jam 5 sore kamar tidak juga tersedia. Selain hal tersebut, pihak costumer service juga menyarankan pergantian kamar dari non smoking, ke kamar smoking room. Alasan kenapa saya memesan kamar non smoking karena saya membawa bayi umur 6 bulan. Apakah hal seperti ini tidak diajarkan ke staff hotel yang bekerja? Kenapa mereka dengan mudah ingin mengganti pesanan saya. Komitmen hotel Anda juga mengecewakan, karena alasan saya tidak dapat chek in tepat waktu karena kamar penuh. Padahal saya sudah memesan jauh hari dan sudah membayarnya. Saya juga memesan di kelas Execuitve deluxe, kelas tersebut adalah kelas termahal yang tertera di Traveloka. Ini adalah hari pertama saya menginap di hotel Jw mariot, saya tahu mungkin komplain saya tidak akan di tanggapi pihak JW karena hotel Anda juga banyak tamu. Jadi mungkin tamu seperti saya jadi terlihat sepele di pelayanan Anda. Semoga manajemen JW mariot membaca tulisan saya dan menjadi pelajaran untuk perbaikan kedepan. Hormat Saya, Ismail Marzuki."
"116.","Rudi Anwar","41","2024-01-01","5","Hotel Bintang Lima di tengah kota Medan. Dengan segudang fasilitas hotel bertaraf internasional. Ketika sampai didepan loby sudah mendapatkan service yang memuaskan, dengan keamanan tingkat satu dan kenyamanan terasa ketika masuk kedalam loby room. Penyambutan yang ramah dan instruksi yang jelas membuat kita nyaman. Ruang loby yang sangat luas dan ornamen2 khas kota Medan membuat suasana terasa lega. Saya berkunjung ke hotel ini menghadiri undangan rapat pembahasan operasional dan anggaran dengan stackholder pusat. Setelah mendapatkan arahan dari petugas kami langsung diarahkan kelantai 1. Lantai 1 & 2 diperuntukkan sebagi lounge meeting dan acara2 besar. Lokasi lantai 1 sangat luas dan ruang lounge utk meetingnya juga sangat besar. Selain itu untuk menu makan siang tergantung pilihan menu, ada western dan chines food. Pihak panitia memilih western food. Dengan pilihan menu yang sangat beragam. Dari menu pembuka, utama dan penutup semua tersedia. Ditambah pilihan makanan khas kota Medan seperti roti cane + gulai kambingnya, roti jala dan pilihan saladnya sangat beragam. Rekomendasi untuk perusahaan2 bonafid untuk menggunakan fasilitas di hotel JW Marriot Medan. Terimakasih..nnjuuss"

"119.","Samuel Edison","66","2024-01-01","3","Nginep disini krn ada undangan meeting, dipesenin tipe king standar aja. Seneng bgt begitu tau diberi kamar di JW Marriott sm klien, ekspektasi ud tinggi. Petugas di lobi ramah dan sigap bantu turunin barang dari mobil, check in pun mulus. Masuk kamar berasa mewah dan luas. Ranjang dan bantal terlalu empuk utk selera pribadi. Masalah muncul waktu mau mandi, air panas ga ada, cm anget suam2 kuku. Rupa nya unit air panas nya lg masalah. Big point minus, mandi ga nikmat bgt. Ini berarti secara otomatis bathtub ga bs berendem karena aer nya agak dingin Karena ud cape, jd lgsg tidur aja abis mandi. Stgh 6 bangun kaget krn aer yg kluar di semua keran coklat. Ga bs pake kamar mandi deh. Saya tanya ke resepsionis tiba2 pompa error jd aer keruh Sarapan nya lengkap dan banyak macam nya. Tp menurut saya smua yg saya coba hambar ga ada rasa nya, bahkan sampe jus dan cappucino nya jg. Agak mengecewakan sih Pas cek out protes soal air panas n air bersih yg ga ada, cm blg sorry, ga diksh kompensasi apa2. Mengecewakan lah nginep disini, untung cm 1 malam"
"120.","Jessica T","20","2025-01-01","3","Review ini untuk Marriott Cafe. Sy dinner buffet di tgl 29/12 yg bisa dibilang tergolong dkt dgn hari libur. Harusnya makanan yg disediakan itu bervariasi atau gak setidaknya sesuai standart hotel bintang 5. Dessert lapis surabaya dan bolu gulung termasuk produk gagal. Noodle station toppingnya semua pakai produk siap saji alias sosis dan bakso frozen, sushi juga masa hotel bintang 5 sushi yg disediakan itu roll sushi dlm nya hanya pakai timun. Kecewa berat dgn makanan yg disajikan oleh hotel bintang 5. Harga kalau 3x lipat pun sy senang bayar kalau makanan yg disajikan sesuai dgn standart hotel. Untung lontong medan dan western section nya enak. Section pastry and dessert boleh dievaluasi ulang krn bener2 gak sesuai standart. Breakfast croissant jg termasuk gagal croissant nya🥲 buat malu aja kalo hotel bintang 3 masih maklum ini jw marriott🫣"

The whole hotel needs good renovation, The wallpaper was cut for bad repair that probably happened after a leak cause you can see the water damage, The carpet is old. The chair at the desk have scratches, The head board of the bed is dirty with I don’t know what boogers or sperm ( I don’t even want to think about it) And the toilet seat is old and broken , I went to the mall next to and I got some cleaning materials. This my first time in life that I’m writing a bad review on a place and I hope this is also will be the last time I’m doing it but Marriott needs to make sure this hotel are stands in the standards of 5 hotel stars I have to mention about the front desk that did above and behind because I got to the hotel really early and they still let check in and get the room ."

Breakfast was super delicious with a lot of selections of local and international menus. Also, they acknowledged and honored our titanium elite benefits. What made it extra special was hospitality of all the staff who went out of the way to make sure that our needs were taken care of - Shanti at the front desk helped us checking in smoothly, gave us great recommendations for dinner, and when we checked out, she walked us to the door. We will definitely come back. Highest recommendation!!"

"147.","Henry Suripto","227","2022-01-01","4","Hotel bintang 5 yang terletak di pusat kota Medan. Dekat dengan Stasiun Medan dan DeliPark Mall. Kamar yang dilengkapi Bathtub & Shower dan nyaman. Apalagi dapat lokasi di lantai 28, jadi bisa lihat pemandangan kota Medan lebih bagus. Kebersihan kamar bagus, tapi memang kamarnya terkesan sedikit seperti hotel lama. Ada Infinity Pool di lantai 17, tapi harus booking dahulu karena dibatasi selama Pandemi Covid-19 ini. Cuma dapat berenang 30 menit saja, tapi menurut saya sudah cukup deh. Suasanya Infinity Pool bagus, air kolam renang juga tidak terlalu dingin, jadi nyaman untuk berenang sambil lihat pemandangan kota Medan. Untuk Breakfast, variasi makanan/minuman/dessert cukup banyak. Rasa cukup enak, tapi rata-rata rasa spicy. Yang saya puji di sini adalah layanannya yang TOP deh. Waktu masuk ke resto, waktu duduk, waktu makan, waktu sudah mau keluar, disapa dengan sopan sekali. Sayang saya tidak ingat nama yang melayani saya, tapi mereka bekerja profesional deh. Saya sangat menikmati breakfast di resto ini. Sebenarnya saya ingin memberikan bintang 5, tetapi mungkin dikarenakan pandemi covid-19 ini pihak hotel menggunakan banyak staf baru, sehingga banyak yang masih kaku dan kurang senyum. Tapi yang staf lamanya ramah semua. Semoga di kunjungan berikutnya bisa saya berikan bintang 5."

Unfortunately, the quality and cleaniness of the room were poor. It was not like staying in 5 stars class hotel and it was more like 2-3 stars. The bathroom was dirty and smells. It took for hours to drain the bathtub. Some pillow covers and bed sheets were dirty, and lucky we got the covers & sheets replaced. Some wallpaper peeled off. Bathroom wooden skirting was damaged. Fridge was smelly. Some power points came off loose. Sauna room was not properly maintained as most wooden floor and seat came off loose or missing. The only outstanding from this experience was the breakfast. An excellent customer service provided by all staffs from the restaurant even the food was just OK. Location is good, there is a mall nearby."

Tinggal menyebrang di sisi lainnya, terdapat sebuah restoran padang, jika tidak mau makan di mall. Hotel bintang 5 ini memiliki lobby yang luar, entah kenapa, dengan sedikitnya tempat duduk yang ada membuat saya tidak menyukai lobby disini. Sangat sulit jika sedang menunggu orang lain. Untuk restoran saat sarapan, menu yang disediakan sangat menarik dan enak. Tapi tidak untuk makan siang. Menu yang disediakan tidak banyak, dan rasanya tergolong biasa saja, tidak terlalu enak untuk hotel berbintang 5. 4 hari 3 malam menginap dan 4 hari juga menggunakan ruang untuk event. Terdapat 2 tempat untuk event di Marriot, satu tempat di sisi kiri , satu lagi di sisi kanan satu lantai diatasnya. Ruang Boston yang dipakai memiliki kekurangan dari kaca tanpa tirai di sekeliling ruangan, yang menyebabkan presentasi yang ditampilkan tidak jelas karena cahaya. Dan membuat ruangan lebih panas. Berbeda dengan ruang di sayap kiri lantai bawahnya, mereka tidak menggunakan kaca. Untuk kamar, interiornya sangat mewah, hanya saja karpetnya sudah tidak dalam kondisi cukup baik lagi. Tapi kelengkapan dari kamar sudah sangat baik ditambah sebuah masker, sanitizer dan tisu basah yang diberikan setiap harinya pada masa pandemi ini."

Room is spacious enough for a roll away bed & bathroom is well stocked with amenities. Breakfast is served at the coffee house & no afternoon tea at all, much to our dismay. Only evening cocktails are served at the lounge. Hor d'oeuvres is limited but sufficient as there's hardly any crowd. There is no beer, wine or spirits in sight. We were asked if we wanted any on an evening, the next evening my husband had to ask for it. Location wise, it was roughly about 45mins drive from Kualanamu airport. A huge mall just across the street and a decent nasi padang restaurant just steps away. Quan spa is on level 17. Room is clean & neat. 20% off body massages for in-house guests.

But Swimming pool is poorly maintained, there are lots of sandy bits when walking in the children pool. The lightbulbs sockets inside the adult pool are exposed with wire dangling out...

I came here for a business meeting and stay for a night, but I do enjoy an impeccable service from the staff, starting from the check-in counter, as well as breakfast / restaurant staff. The room is exquisite, spacious enough to give you a good sense of comfort. Bed is nice, perfect firmness for the mattress and pillows, and complete amenities in the room. Toiletries are from Aromatherapy Associates London (I love the smell!). Safety box is available, so are free bottled water, tea and coffee. Bath tub and shower are both available in the room I came during Ramadhan so the hotel lobby is beautifully adorned with Ramadhan - themed decorations. I also enjoyed the Shaum or early morning breakfast before fasting. The menu is quite complete and tasty. You have a variety of bread, cereals, congee or porridge as well as Indonesian food corner. The egg station is also available. The location of the hotel is also strategic. The meeting room as well as the auditorium is available. It looks posh and comfortable, with complete audio visual equipment. The hotel is also ♿️ disability friendly. Pool is available, at the same floor as the gym as well as sauna. Happy to be back here"

"191.","Brian Yates","37","2025-01-01","5","Update to my review below: I must say that the staff try so hard to make the experience the best at the JW. From personalised welcomes, asking if there is anything they can help with (such as special requests at breakfast, and even putting together a take away food box for me). On my final night in Medan (after a trip to Lake Toba) I re-stayed at the JW. It was like returning home and immediately I felt at peace after a long and crazy day on the road. Yuni welcomed me in the lobby and then checked me in at executive lounge, making sure I felt very welcomed. I was provided a lovely room with a nice little note and gift welcoming me back. I only had a very short overnight stay, but the food in the lounge was delicious and helped me wind down after the long day. Big shout out to Yuni for her help and attention to service. Just fantastic and upgrading my review based on this. Previous review: The JW in Medan seems slightly confused. In one moment, it tries to be luxurious and does hit the mark in many areas, yet in the next it feels very disappointing in its delivery. Okay, I booked two rooms including executive lounge access. It was a very busy time in the JW over the NY celebrations. Big queues to lifts (noting that at the busiest time only 2 of the 3 lifts were in operation - not sure why as 3rd lift started operating again once the crowds reduced, a little bizarre! ). The executive lounge is probably the worst executive lounge I have visited based on its very limited offering. It is also not the most welcoming of spaced with a lack of furnishings and simple offerings. However it does make up some ground during the so called cocktail hours (6-8pm) where the food was reasonable and there was some very basic wine and beer (and one supposed cocktail being a J&T). But staff were very pleasant and worked hard to make the experience the best. On the last night Nurul was amazing and very personalble. She made us all feel very welcome! For the rest of the experience the room was fine, but not grand. The pool is a big disappointment with very bare concrete areas and a lack of lounge or bar. You can order room service there but it took for ever to arrive, but it was a very busy time. Food overall was great, especially the breakfasts. The gym is good and was up there with the best. The staff were super friendly and tried so hard to make it he experience very personalised. However, I would say that this is not a JW experience. I have travelled extensively and stayed at many Bonvoy properties along with many others, and while I was satisfied with the stay it could have been so much more if small tweaks were made to improve the property and how it delivers. It is really missing that luxury experience, and that is why we stay at JW."

I'm so dissapointed because i hv few clients in Medan and i wanna send cakes and hampers from this Hotel thru Mariott Gourmet. I called the Hotel 5 times in the evening and the staff say greetings and hang up the phone and after the 6th times i tried to call and finally they answer it . I told the staff that i'm from jakarta and i'd like to order some of the cakes and the hampers and requested to send the price list and the staff asked to leave my phone number and name so the Mariott Gourmet can reach me. And In the day after i tried to call it again and the staff put me through to the mariott gourmet and they didn't answered, back to the staff again and same like in the evening yesterday leave your phone number and so on..'Till today they're not reach me at all. It's so dissapointing.. I think this hotel services quite different with JW Mariott in Jakarta based on my experience. And for the Conclusion i'think that's a Great Experience and it's enough for me.Thank you."

The water at the bath tub “sometimes” is not clear. So I wondering why it is occasionally has this problem, it is sometimes clear sometimes not. 2. At the standing shower area, the water outflow is terribly slow hence it is irritated during shower time; then I removed or adjusted the cover everyday after the housekeeping team cleaned the room. So I wondering the head of housekeeping team should alert the housekeeper team to report this in their daily cleaning report so that the HOD knows how to address this issue rather than just let the normal housekeeper ignore the issue. The housekeeper should be aware as it is their routine duty during the cleaning process, unless they didn’t clean the standing shower area. Note. However the rest of the facilities are all good ya, I like their breakfast area, the front desk and lobby attendants hospitality as well as their food outlets."

"201.","yoga andrian","11","2022-01-01","1","Saya mempunyai pengalaman yang sangat buruk ketika menginap di hotel ini, diantaranya: 1. Antrian saat cekin sangat panjang, proses cekin sangat lama dikarenakan staf resepsionis hanya satu orang, tidak ada inisiatif hotel untuk menambah jumlah resepsionis. 2. Harga yang diinfo saat cekin berbeda jauh saat saya cekout. Sempat kaget ketika cekout dan akan membayar tagihan saya harus membayar kelebihan hampir 1 juta rupiah utk total menginap 3 malam dari informasi harga awal. Dengan alasan informasi harga awal belum termasuk tax servis dll. Padahal saat cekin sudah diinfo hotel bahwa harga tersebut adalah corporate rate dan tidak ada info bahwa harga tersebut belum tax servis dll 3. Fasilitas hotel tidak layak disebut hotel bintang 5, sandal, brush kit dll seperti hotel bintang 2 4. Ceiling kamar bocor 5. Pelayanan staf sangat tidak memuaskan dan tidak ada solusi konkrit ketika ada problem Sangat tidak menjadi rekomendasi utk menginap disini ketika ke medan. Masih banyak hotel lain dengan fasilitas dan servis yg lebih baik di medan"

We shared one room and bathroom to shower etc until 2nd room ready at 6pm. Went to Spa for massage at 745pm and told they were closed. Hotel said it closes at 10pm. Upon check out I informed the staff I would be be paying the full amount for the 2nd room. They said it was not possible on their ancient system to discount the room. They gave 2x breakfast free. Had I had the available time and not such a language barrier, I would not have accepted this. For a room to not be ready at 6pm is unacceptable. Beds were not like many other Marriott’s I have visited. Quite hard and not the soft Marriott style. Rooms nicely maintained in an older style. Breakfast 10/10.

The pillow is so thin that we could actually fold it 4 times…… and its happens to all the pillows in the room. We ask for a better pillow.

For example the sauna and jacuzzi are not great. The jacuzzi looks really old and dirty. A lot of walpaper in the hotel isnt sticking to the wall anymore and needs to be redone. The couches are stained and old. Also a lot of dust behind the bed. Its a fine hotel but it is not living up to the marriot standard. Please renovate to make it up to date."

Pengalaman pribadi mengatakan hotel ini merupakan salah satu hotel terbaik yang ada di Medan. Ketika masuk ke hotel ini, pemeriksaan yang ketat dari securiti standar JW Marriott menjamin keamanan tinggi di hotel ini. Interior lobbynya sangat megah dan mewah. Pelayanan dari staf resepsionis dan satpam juga sangat ramah, sigap dan berkelas. Ruangan kamar juga sangat lega, luas, nyaman dan bersih dengan view kota Medan. Walaupun hotel ini beroperasi kalau tidak salah dari tahun 2008, namun hotel ini sangat terawat dan terlihat masih seperti baru. Sarapan pagi di hotel ini merupakan salah satu sarapan terbaik yang pernah saya nikmati, pilihan menunya sangat variatif dengan rasa makanan yang sangat memanjakan lidah."

"270.","marlene fresilia","22","2024-01-01","2","Staying for 3 nights, weekday to weekend till 22 jul, here is my full review till last day BREAKFAST : (-) I think their restaurant manager should manage their busy restaurant by keep checking their trainee to keep table clean and checked for every empty water glass than taking their breakfast in front of guest. Never in my exp to see manager just eating but not checking the readyness of the table that used from customer before. Note for you manager, its marriot cmon. Im observing your breakfast for 2 days. Napkins, neither Jade or breakfast they never set full on the table. Uncomplete cutlery set, glasses, mugs. Sometimes you have to call the staff to fill the glass, sometimes they offer you to fill the glass. (+) kitchen staff were great, neat, attentive and fast pace. The variety of food is quite ok for international, india, dimsum and 3 local breakfast . The fruit selection was great. ROOM : (-) helplessly, i dont know what to say. Uneven light bulb color on my room, different bath math from the connected room. Different set of washroom amenities like shampoo etc. Almost broken shower glass, but yes they fixed it after we call the front office. Really.. Oh also, dusty inside the tissue box of bathroom, loosen handle bar on bathtub, broke AC that cant adjust the temp, that need to be fixed for 2 hours, but i dont want to fixed and relying my temp from the connected room. (+) Bed were neat and clean, wifi was great, refrigerator, tv and spacious quiet room. They have drawers that suit for long stay cust. Please do train the receptionist to give attention and talk to queueing customer on concierge for waiting when the concierge staff is nowhere even they were handling their queuing (only 2 or 3) customers. Wasting more than 5 minutes just to drop my box with no greetings. I dont mind if the recept were busy, but they keep talk to each other when i call the recept from concierge, till i have to shout loudly for 2-3 times so i the staff stop talking and asking me. For Jade restaurant : The food absolutely amazing, the male staff were very care. But i think they need someone to stand visibly to the guest so they can be called faster. Maybe they short of staff? Lastly, they were informed that they will do something on my room for my baby 1st bday. But they forgot till i have to remind them and find other alternative to make sure i have a cake for my baby. And yes, they came to do.little decoration on the room. Thanks to mba Enjelica and partner i really appreciate that. Thank you for bapak receipt and bapak concierge with warm hospitality and did remember some details, the neat kitchen and warm kitchen staff, perfect. We do appreciate the warm from the staff on the last day too. Maybe i expecting too much just like the other marriot. This one is kinda expensive but the neatness is somehow below than other marriot i have visited. Hope u can fix it fast Oh they also accomodate customer to order something from gojek or grab"

"278.","indra nasution","149","2020-01-01","5","Hotel bintang 5 di lokasi steategis di medan. Dekat kemana mana. Fasilitas hotel sangat nyaman. Cuma sayang layanan hotel nya perlu ditingkatkan. Karena walau karakter orang medan seperti itu, tapi tetap karena ini jw.marriot pasti ada standard yang sama dimanapun lokasinya. Khususnya layanan blanket nya. Fasilitas ballroom juga ok. Hal lain yang perlu ditingkatkan adalah variasi menu untuk sarapan maupun makan siang. Juga peningkatan rasa menu-menu yang dihidangkan. Sayang bila hotel bintang 5 namun menunya kurang menarik. Overall, bila cost nginap nya bisa menyesuaikan dengan government rate, mantap sih. Good job marriot medan.👍"

Kami pesan makanan untuk 300 porsi, sementara tamu yang hadir hanya sekitar 150-200 orang, tapi menu bersisa hanya untuk sekitar 30-40 orang😕 Jangan terkejut saat di gerbang masuk kendaraan kita akan diperiksa oleh para security dan seekor anjing besar😬"

Saya tunjuk apkh msh bisa sy ambil makanan yg msh terhidang ditempatnya krn blm semua dibereskan, dia bilang tidak bisa krn sdh clear up. Lalu sy bertanya lagi, apa bisa sy diambilkan barang 1 menu saja buat sy... mgk omlete, atau makanan apapun sedikit saja krn sy jg buru2 mau segera melanjutkan acara seminar notaris yg kebetulan jg dilaksanakan di hotel jw marriot, dgn judesnya dia bilang, kalo mau alacarte silahkan pesen di resto bawah saja jgn disini. Tdk ada sdktpun sy denger ada kalimat sopan , mgk bisa diawali dgn kata 'maaf' atau mgk wajah senyum penuh keramahan... atau mgk berikanlah sdkt pelayanan extra buat tamu yg menginap di kamar eksekutif selama 4 mlm, aplg sy selama menginap tsb,tdk pernah sekalipun sempat breakfast krn kesibukan tertentu. Eh sekalinya mau breakfast, malah mendapatkan pengalaman yg tdk mengenakkan hati. Apa pantas pelayanan spt itu unt hotel bintang 5 sekelas jw marriot? Sementara saya membayar permalamnya unt kamar saya sebesar 2,3jt? Ditambah lagi pelayanan operator tatkala saya menelpon krn sy mau extend dihari berikutnya... juga sangat judes dan tdk sopan sama skl, yg akhirnya sy urungkan unt extend.

"317.","DMS","51","2024-01-01","5","Sorry for the late post. We were at the JW Marriot Hotel in Medan Indonesia from Sept 7th 2019 to Sept 14th 2019. From the moment we arrived we were treated with much care and so much kindness, the best treatment then any other Hotel. We were tired and hungry when we arrived around 10am so while waiting for our room we ate and drank in the lounge area Roni was our service man and gave a variety of food selections. Our dining experience was amazing and we give special thanks to the Chefs who made a beautiful presentation in the buffet, plus it is ketogenic diet & diabetic diet friendly with lots of plant based dishes too. The food is fresh with fresh ingredients and I did not detect any highly processed ingredients. The Italian salami was the best I've ever had, so delicious, I wished I could have had some delivered to the USA because I'm still dreaming of it!!! Everyone we encountered was very hospitable and accommodating. Our room and the view was spectacular we also had a joining room for my mother inlaw and sister inlaw, we thank our check in for arranging that. The lemon grass water given to us upon our arrival was amazing and hydrating. On one of our evenings we had about 20 family members eat dinner with us in the buffet and we all enjoyed our meal. This hotel exceeded all our expectations and we will definitely stay at this hotel if we come to Medan again. A special thanks to Roni our lounge Service man he was very accommodating. We thank our wonderful servers Mirta, Anastasia, Dedy and Adji for making our stay enjoyable. I know there were more but I wasn't able to remember and write down everyones name😔. Sorry we didn't get a chance to check out the spa and pool but we will save that for our next visit. So if you are coming from the USA to Medan Indonesia this hotel is a must❣👍God bless all of you.💌👍"

"325.","christian wahyudi","244","2020-01-01","4","Sepertinya hotel terlaris di Medan utk bikin event. Waktu sy bikin event disana, semua 6 meeting room laku. Ada wedding di ballroom, ada wedding di lt 2, ada hut 1 thn di cafe (tempat breakfastnya) dan kalo pas disana serasa seperti di pasar, cuman pengunjungnya berkelas semua. Pelayanan baik sekali, karena memang bintang 5. Cuman ya ada resiko kalo menggunakan hotel bintang 5 yg laris seperti ini. Kadang antar departemen kurang bisa koordinasi dgn baik. Bila mau bikin event haruslah tanya dgn teliti karena banyak faktor X yg terjadi di menit2 terakhir. Utk Dinnernya bagus, fresh, banyak pilihan menunya. Tapi rasanya ya ga terlalu special2 banget menurut lidah saya. Hampir sama kaya JW Marriott disurabaya."

"333.","Kevin Butler","437","2020-01-01","5","This is a very impressive hotel. Such an elegant (and rather opulent) lobby. The check in staff spoke very good English and were really professional and super nice. The lifts require your room key card, and you may have to try a few times to get the card to work, bit of a glitch. Once in your room, the views across Medan are amazing. As is the view from your bed into the bathroom! Or of course, from the bathroom you can still see out the rooms window. A great design. The rooms are well equipped with everything you may need, huge 55 TV, desk, iron & ironing board, scales (if staying for a while these are necessary - the food in the restaurants is amazing). Oh and the bar is very good too, all in all the JW Marriot Medan is well worth 5 stars. I was told this is the least expensive of all the JW Marriott's internationally, so staying here while visiting Medan is well worth it."
"334.","Andry Chowanda","205","2023-01-01","5","Hotelnya cukup bagus. Bangunannya tinggi dan designnya cukup bagus.

"368.","Jenny M","10","2019-01-01","1","AVOID at all cause to stay in this JW Marriott Medan!! Standard is way below par compared to other JW, nothing like a 5-star hotel. Pictures speak a thousand words (and I have them). My sister and I were staying in room 2226 and after sitting on the yellow sofa in the room for 15 minutes, she felt uneasy.. itchy to be precise. The next day.. BED BUGS bites everywhere! I’m sure they have not vacuum or clean those sofas for years. It’s disheartening and upsetting as these will probably leave marks and take months to recover. To top things, I recently had my wedding there. Wish I was warned earlier. Other cons from guests: - Water in the shower couldn’t pass through, drainage wasn’t cleaned - No air conditioning in the lobby, some rooms air con were not working - No hair dryer and/or bath robe in some rooms - No hair conditioner provided - All 3 lifts went out of power for 20 minutes at one time! 5-star? Seriously... I’m writing my honest review to warn people about this JW Marriott in Medan. Better be safe than sorry!"

Perihal breakfast yg hanya disediakan utk 1org saja krn sy tidak mengubah jumlah tamu di aplikasi tiket.com pada saat booking kmar? Wowww tidak sekalian saja sy hanya diijinkan masuk 1 tamu 1 kmar sesuai pesanan sy diaplikasi? Ini pengalaman pertama hanya diberikan 1 BF utk kmar yg sy booking, padahal sy sering melakukan pemesanan di hotel bintang 5 lainnya dan dgn booking yg sama yakni 1 tamu dan tidak pernah dimasalahkan oleh pihak hotel dan selalu diberikan Breakfast utk 2 tamu, mau di Medan, luar kota, bahkan luar negri. Karna setau sy umumnya Hotel menyediakan Breakfast utk 2 tamu per kamar standart. Dan kmar yg sy pesan adalah type Deluks King, bukan kamar paling murah atau kmar single, yg jelas2 utk 2 tamu per kamar. Worth it kah BF hanya utk 1 tamu? Begitu kakunya kah hotel bintang 5 yg mengikuti jumlah angka di aplikasi yg bahkan mau diinput 1 atau 2 tamu harga per kamar dgn 1 atau 2 sarapan tetap sama harganya, tidak ada bedanya 1 sen pun. Dan krn ini sy hrus byar extra 1 BF lg utk 1 org seharga ratusan ribu, wawww pdhl bru bulan lalu sy inap di hotel bintang 5 lainnya di Medan dgn case yg sama sy hanya input 1 tamu krn sy tdk pernah ubah2 lg, dan tidak ada mslh sy tetap makan dgn suami dan anak sy. Akan sy maklumi apabila terdapat perbedaan harga untuk 1 atau 2 tamu, dan masalahnya disini adalah TIDAK ADA PERBEDAAN HARGA. Sy ingin merayakan anniversary sy hari ini dan baru juga check in sy sudah diberikan bad experience, Thank you JW Medan, never coming back again. 1.9jt for 1 Breakfast👍👍"

Range pilihan appetizer, menu utama sampai desserts nya sangat terbatas. Saya dan keluarga datang untuk ocassion khusus di ruang VIP tapi pilihan makanan nya terlalu sedikit. Ini bukan kali pertama saya dan keluarga menikmati buffet dinner di Marriot Cafe, tapi kali ini sangat kecewa dan merasa dirugikan.

"381.","ismail marzuki","7","2025-01-14","1","Sehubungan dengan pesanan saya pada hotel Jw marriot tanggal 13-15 April 2024. Saya merasa kecewa terhadap pelayanan hotel Anda, jadwal check in di jam 3 sore seharusnya. Akan tetapi, sampai dengan jam 5 sore kamar tidak juga tersedia. Selain hal tersebut, pihak costumer service juga menyarankan pergantian kamar dari non smoking, ke kamar smoking room. Alasan kenapa saya memesan kamar non smoking karena saya membawa bayi umur 6 bulan. Apakah hal seperti ini tidak diajarkan ke staff hotel yang bekerja? Kenapa mereka dengan mudah ingin mengganti pesanan saya. Komitmen hotel Anda juga mengecewakan, karena alasan saya tidak dapat chek in tepat waktu karena kamar penuh. Padahal saya sudah memesan jauh hari dan sudah membayarnya. Saya juga memesan di kelas Execuitve deluxe, kelas tersebut adalah kelas termahal yang tertera di Traveloka. Ini adalah hari pertama saya menginap di hotel Jw mariot, saya tahu mungkin komplain saya tidak akan di tanggapi pihak JW karena hotel Anda juga banyak tamu. Jadi mungkin tamu seperti saya jadi terlihat sepele di pelayanan Anda. Semoga manajemen JW mariot membaca tulisan saya dan menjadi pelajaran untuk perbaikan kedepan. Hormat Saya, Ismail Marzuki."

Kami check in di hotel seharus pukul 13.00 tp diberikan kunci pukul 15.00 2. Makanan yang kami makan ada serangganya boleh liat foto/videonya. 3. Staf dan FOnya sangat tidak ramah kepada tamu jika terjadi kendala. Mohon dipertimbangkan lg kalau menginap dihotel ini, katanya bintang 5 tp rasa losmen. Semoga jadi masukan untuk manajemen untuk evaluasi semua lini."

"388.","yoga andrian","11","2022-01-14","1","Saya mempunyai pengalaman yang sangat buruk ketika menginap di hotel ini, diantaranya: 1. Antrian saat cekin sangat panjang, proses cekin sangat lama dikarenakan staf resepsionis hanya satu orang, tidak ada inisiatif hotel untuk menambah jumlah resepsionis. 2. Harga yang diinfo saat cekin berbeda jauh saat saya cekout. Sempat kaget ketika cekout dan akan membayar tagihan saya harus membayar kelebihan hampir 1 juta rupiah utk total menginap 3 malam dari informasi harga awal. Dengan alasan informasi harga awal belum termasuk tax servis dll. Padahal saat cekin sudah diinfo hotel bahwa harga tersebut adalah corporate rate dan tidak ada info bahwa harga tersebut belum tax servis dll 3. Fasilitas hotel tidak layak disebut hotel bintang 5, sandal, brush kit dll seperti hotel bintang 2 4. Ceiling kamar bocor 5. Pelayanan staf sangat tidak memuaskan dan tidak ada solusi konkrit ketika ada problem Sangat tidak menjadi rekomendasi utk menginap disini ketika ke medan. Masih banyak hotel lain dengan fasilitas dan servis yg lebih baik di medan"

Saya tunjuk apkh msh bisa sy ambil makanan yg msh terhidang ditempatnya krn blm semua dibereskan, dia bilang tidak bisa krn sdh clear up. Lalu sy bertanya lagi, apa bisa sy diambilkan barang 1 menu saja buat sy... mgk omlete, atau makanan apapun sedikit saja krn sy jg buru2 mau segera melanjutkan acara seminar notaris yg kebetulan jg dilaksanakan di hotel jw marriot, dgn judesnya dia bilang, kalo mau alacarte silahkan pesen di resto bawah saja jgn disini. Tdk ada sdktpun sy denger ada kalimat sopan , mgk bisa diawali dgn kata 'maaf' atau mgk wajah senyum penuh keramahan... atau mgk berikanlah sdkt pelayanan extra buat tamu yg menginap di kamar eksekutif selama 4 mlm, aplg sy selama menginap tsb,tdk pernah sekalipun sempat breakfast krn kesibukan tertentu. Eh sekalinya mau breakfast, malah mendapatkan pengalaman yg tdk mengenakkan hati. Apa pantas pelayanan spt itu unt hotel bintang 5 sekelas jw marriot? Sementara saya membayar permalamnya unt kamar saya sebesar 2,3jt? Ditambah lagi pelayanan operator tatkala saya menelpon krn sy mau extend dihari berikutnya... juga sangat judes dan tdk sopan sama skl, yg akhirnya sy urungkan unt extend. Selanjutnya... mgk sy akan berpikir 1000x unt menginap kembali di JW Marriot Medan"

Saya memberi tahu staf bahwa saya dari Jakarta dan saya ingin memesan beberapa kue dan hampers dan meminta untuk mengirim daftar harga dan staf meminta untuk meninggalkan nomor telepon dan nama saya sehingga Mariott Gourmet dapat menghubungi saya. Dan keesokan harinya saya mencoba meneleponnya lagi dan staf menghubungkan saya ke Mariott Gourmet dan mereka tidak menjawab, kembali ke staf lagi dan sama seperti di malam kemarin meninggalkan nomor telepon Anda dan seterusnya..

Saya dan saudara perempuan saya menginap di kamar 2226 dan setelah duduk di sofa kuning di kamar selama 15 menit, dia merasa tidak nyaman.. lebih tepatnya gatal. Keesokan harinya.. KUTU BEDAK menggigit di mana-mana! Saya yakin mereka tidak menyedot debu atau membersihkan sofa-sofa itu selama bertahun-tahun. Ini mengecewakan dan menjengkelkan karena mungkin akan meninggalkan bekas dan butuh waktu berbulan-bulan untuk pulih. Yang lebih parah, saya baru saja menikah di sana. Andai saja saya diberi tahu lebih awal. Kekurangan lain dari tamu: - Air di kamar mandi tidak bisa mengalir, saluran pembuangan tidak dibersihkan - Tidak ada AC di lobi, AC di beberapa kamar tidak berfungsi - Tidak ada pengering rambut dan/atau jubah mandi di beberapa kamar - Tidak disediakan kondisioner rambut - Ketiga lift mati listrik selama 20 menit sekaligus!

Keamanan/bellboy tidak membantu. Saya membawa dua koper besar dan tidak ada yang menawarkan bantuan untuk mengangkatnya ke bagasi mobil. Secara keseluruhan menginap di sini tidak menyenangkan karena layanan staf. JW Marriott Medan Anda perlu lebih banyak melatih staf Anda."

Kualitas tempat tidurnya seperti hotel bintang 3, sampai-sampai punggung saya sakit, jadi saya harus meletakkan bantal di bawah pinggang agar bisa tidur nyenyak. Check-out pukul 12 siang, tetapi check-in pukul 3 sore (biasanya pukul 2 siang)."
"487.","Terence Mah","64","2019-01-14","1","Menginap di kamar 2540 pada 2 Agustus 2018 Kamar Eksekutif Jika ada di antara kalian yang mendapatkan kamar ini, segera minta ganti kamar! Kamar mandi bocor dari atas mangkuk toilet. Air menetes di atas kepala kami saat kami duduk di mangkuk toilet. Solusi hotel: Kirim petugas kebersihan, yang kemudian memanggil teknisi untuk mengatasi masalah pada pukul 23.00, lalu memutuskan bahwa kebocoran akan membutuhkan waktu lebih lama untuk diperbaiki. Oleh karena itu, kami meminta mereka untuk memberi tahu mereka ketika kami meninggalkan hotel keesokan harinya agar mereka dapat memperbaikinya, BUKANNYA mengganti kamar kami. Resepsionis nomor 1 mengatakan semua kamar penuh malam ini. Setelah beberapa patah kata, tiba-tiba nomor tersebut dialihkan ke resepsionis nomor 2 yang mengatakan sebenarnya ada kamar yang tersedia tetapi di LANTAI MEROKOK. Lihat ketidakkonsistenannya? Dan membawa nama MARRIOTT seperti ini.. Memalukan"

Saat ini saya menginap di hotel ini, karena sangat mengganggu dan saya ingin berbagi cerita ini agar saya merasa lebih baik. Resepsionisnya (yang namanya Rully) sangat lambat. Saya baru saja mendarat, dan saya membawa bayi saya (Anda tahu, rasanya jauh lebih lelah jika membawa bayi dalam perjalanan)... Satu-satunya yang ada di pikiran saya adalah ingin istirahat.. Saya tiba di hotel jam 4 sore (waktu check-in jam 3 sore), jadi wajar saja kalau saya berpikir kamar sudah siap dan berharap proses check-in cepat... Ternyata butuh waktu lama sekali ketika dia memasukkan data.. Ketika dia memberi saya amplopnya, saya pikir akhirnya selesai, dan saya bisa istirahat, tetapi kuncinya tidak ada, dan dia malah menyuruh saya pergi ke samping karena dia ingin melayani tamu lain, kuncinya belum siap. Dan aku menunggu lagi, kukira dia akan otomatis memberiku, tapi itu hanya imajinasiku.. Aku harus bertanya lagi... Ayolah, Bung, ini sangat tidak profesional."

Perihal breakfast yg hanya disediakan utk 1org saja krn sy tidak mengubah jumlah tamu di aplikasi tiket.com pada saat booking kmar? Wowww tidak sekalian saja sy hanya diijinkan masuk 1 tamu 1 kmar sesuai pesanan sy diaplikasi? Ini pengalaman pertama hanya diberikan 1 BF utk kmar yg sy booking, padahal sy sering melakukan pemesanan di hotel bintang 5 lainnya dan dgn booking yg sama yakni 1 tamu dan tidak pernah dimasalahkan oleh pihak hotel dan selalu diberikan Breakfast utk 2 tamu, mau di Medan, luar kota, bahkan luar negri. Karna setau sy umumnya Hotel menyediakan Breakfast utk 2 tamu per kamar standart. Dan kmar yg sy pesan adalah type Deluks King, bukan kamar paling murah atau kmar single, yg jelas2 utk 2 tamu per kamar. Worth it kah BF hanya utk 1 tamu? Begitu kakunya kah hotel bintang 5 yg mengikuti jumlah angka di aplikasi yg bahkan mau diinput 1 atau 2 tamu harga per kamar dgn 1 atau 2 sarapan tetap sama harganya, tidak ada bedanya 1 sen pun. Dan krn ini sy hrus byar extra 1 BF lg utk 1 org seharga ratusan ribu, wawww pdhl bru bulan lalu sy inap di hotel bintang 5 lainnya di Medan dgn case yg sama sy hanya input 1 tamu krn sy tdk pernah ubah2 lg, dan tidak ada mslh sy tetap makan dgn suami dan anak sy. Akan sy maklumi apabila terdapat perbedaan harga untuk 1 atau 2 tamu, dan masalahnya disini adalah TIDAK ADA PERBEDAAN HARGA. Sy ingin merayakan anniversary sy hari ini dan baru juga check in sy sudah diberikan bad experience, Thank you JW Medan, never coming back again. 1.9jt for 1 Breakfast👍👍"

Saya merasa kecewa terhadap pelayanan hotel Anda, jadwal check in di jam 3 sore seharusnya. Akan tetapi, sampai dengan jam 5 sore kamar tidak juga tersedia. Selain hal tersebut, pihak costumer service juga menyarankan pergantian kamar dari non smoking, ke kamar smoking room. Alasan kenapa saya memesan kamar non smoking karena saya membawa bayi umur 6 bulan. Apakah hal seperti ini tidak diajarkan ke staff hotel yang bekerja? Kenapa mereka dengan mudah ingin mengganti pesanan saya. Komitmen hotel Anda juga mengecewakan, karena alasan saya tidak dapat chek in tepat waktu karena kamar penuh. Padahal saya sudah memesan jauh hari dan sudah membayarnya. Saya juga memesan di kelas Execuitve deluxe, kelas tersebut adalah kelas termahal yang tertera di Traveloka. Ini adalah hari pertama saya menginap di hotel Jw mariot, saya tahu mungkin komplain saya tidak akan di tanggapi pihak JW karena hotel Anda juga banyak tamu. Jadi mungkin tamu seperti saya jadi terlihat sepele di pelayanan Anda. Semoga manajemen JW mariot membaca tulisan saya dan menjadi pelajaran untuk perbaikan kedepan. Hormat Saya, Ismail Marzuki."

Harga yang diinfo saat cekin berbeda jauh saat saya cekout. Sempat kaget ketika cekout dan akan membayar tagihan saya harus membayar kelebihan hampir 1 juta rupiah utk total menginap 3 malam dari informasi harga awal. Dengan alasan informasi harga awal belum termasuk tax servis dll. Padahal saat cekin sudah diinfo hotel bahwa harga tersebut adalah corporate rate dan tidak ada info bahwa harga tersebut belum tax servis dll 3.

Bantal di kamar sangat kempes dan tidak nyaman, sehingga sulit untuk tidur nyenyak. Yang lebih menjengkelkan lagi adalah kebisingannya. Kedap suara hotel sangat buruk, dan bahkan pada pukul 12:49 dini hari, masih ada pesta yang ramai. Kebisingannya sangat mengganggu dan membuat saya hampir tidak bisa beristirahat dengan baik. Meskipun lokasi dan aspek lain dari hotel ini cukup baik, saya pikir peningkatan kedap suara dan penyediaan bantal yang lebih nyaman akan sangat meningkatkan pengalaman tamu."

Saya sangat kecewa karena saya memiliki beberapa klien di Medan dan saya ingin mengirim kue dan hampers dari hotel ini melalui Mariott Gourmet. Saya menelepon hotel 5 kali di malam hari dan staf mengucapkan salam dan menutup telepon dan setelah 6 kali saya mencoba menelepon dan akhirnya mereka menjawabnya. Saya memberi tahu staf bahwa saya dari Jakarta dan saya ingin memesan beberapa kue dan hampers dan meminta untuk mengirim daftar harga dan staf meminta untuk meninggalkan nomor telepon dan nama saya sehingga Mariott Gourmet dapat menghubungi saya. Dan keesokan harinya saya mencoba meneleponnya lagi dan staf menghubungkan saya ke Mariott Gourmet dan mereka tidak menjawab, kembali ke staf lagi dan sama seperti di malam kemarin meninggalkan nomor telepon Anda dan seterusnya.. 'Sampai hari ini mereka tidak menghubungi saya sama sekali.' Sangat mengecewakan.. Berdasarkan pengalaman saya, layanan hotel ini cukup berbeda dengan JW Marriott di Jakarta. Dan untuk kesimpulannya, menurut saya itu pengalaman yang luar biasa dan sudah cukup bagi saya. Terima kasih."

"643.","Jenny M","10","2019-01-21","1","HINDARI sama sekali karena menginap di JW Marriott Medan ini!! Standarnya jauh di bawah standar dibandingkan dengan JW lainnya, tidak seperti hotel bintang 5. Gambar berbicara seribu kata (dan saya memilikinya). Saya dan saudara perempuan saya menginap di kamar 2226 dan setelah duduk di sofa kuning di kamar selama 15 menit, dia merasa tidak nyaman.. lebih tepatnya gatal. Keesokan harinya.. KUTU BEDAK menggigit di mana-mana! Saya yakin mereka tidak menyedot debu atau membersihkan sofa-sofa itu selama bertahun-tahun. Ini mengecewakan dan menjengkelkan karena mungkin akan meninggalkan bekas dan butuh waktu berbulan-bulan untuk pulih. Yang lebih parah, saya baru saja menikah di sana. Andai saja saya diberi tahu lebih awal. Kekurangan lain dari tamu: - Air di kamar mandi tidak bisa mengalir, saluran pembuangan tidak dibersihkan - Tidak ada AC di lobi, AC di beberapa kamar tidak berfungsi - Tidak ada pengering rambut dan/atau jubah mandi di beberapa kamar - Tidak disediakan kondisioner rambut - Ketiga lift mati listrik selama 20 menit sekaligus!

Pada malam terakhir kami di Medan, kami pindah ke Grand Mercure Maha Cipta Medan Angkasa. Kamarnya modern dan modern, dan yang terbaik, harganya setengah dari harga JW Marriott ini."

Hotel mengiyakan dan mencatat. Pukul 18.00 pelanggan kami tiba dan akhirnya masih belum ada tempat tidur tambahan, handuk dan gelas amenitas masih 2 buah. Setelah menunggu 1,5 jam dan memarahi Pak JOKO, manajer yang bertugas, tempat tidur tambahan akhirnya datang. Pak Joko tetap tidak memiliki rasa hormat dan meminta maaf dengan wajah dinginnya.

Saya dapat mengatakan pengalaman yang saya dapatkan jauh di bawah Marriott Surabaya. Makanannya biasa saja dan keramahannya tidak cukup baik. Yang pasti tidak memenuhi harapan saya untuk menginap di hotel Marriott. Petugas depan tidak ramah sama sekali. Tidak ada senyum sama sekali ketika saya check-in dan check-out. Keamanan/bellboy tidak membantu. Saya membawa dua koper besar dan tidak ada yang menawarkan bantuan untuk mengangkatnya ke bagasi mobil. Secara keseluruhan menginap di sini tidak menyenangkan karena layanan staf. JW Marriott Medan Anda perlu lebih banyak melatih staf Anda."

Kamar mandi bocor dari atas mangkuk toilet. Air menetes di atas kepala kami saat kami duduk di mangkuk toilet. Solusi hotel: Kirim petugas kebersihan, yang kemudian memanggil teknisi untuk mengatasi masalah pada pukul 23.00, lalu memutuskan bahwa kebocoran akan membutuhkan waktu lebih lama untuk diperbaiki. Oleh karena itu, kami meminta mereka untuk memberi tahu mereka ketika kami meninggalkan hotel keesokan harinya agar mereka dapat memperbaikinya, BUKANNYA mengganti kamar kami. Resepsionis nomor 1 mengatakan semua kamar penuh malam ini. Setelah beberapa patah kata, tiba-tiba nomor tersebut dialihkan ke resepsionis nomor 2 yang mengatakan sebenarnya ada kamar yang tersedia tetapi di LANTAI MEROKOK. Lihat ketidakkonsistenannya?

Saya baru saja mendarat, dan saya membawa bayi saya (Anda tahu, rasanya jauh lebih lelah jika membawa bayi dalam perjalanan)... Satu-satunya yang ada di pikiran saya adalah ingin istirahat.. Saya tiba di hotel jam 4 sore (waktu check-in jam 3 sore), jadi wajar saja kalau saya berpikir kamar sudah siap dan berharap proses check-in cepat... Ternyata butuh waktu lama sekali ketika dia memasukkan data.. Ketika dia memberi saya amplopnya, saya pikir akhirnya selesai, dan saya bisa istirahat, tetapi kuncinya tidak ada, dan dia malah menyuruh saya pergi ke samping karena dia ingin melayani tamu lain, kuncinya belum siap. Dan aku menunggu lagi, kukira dia akan otomatis memberiku, tapi itu hanya imajinasiku.. Aku harus bertanya lagi... Ayolah, Bung, ini sangat tidak profesional."

Terus sampai hari nya sudah lewat belum juga di kabarin. Dan saya yang berinisiatif untuk menanyakan kabar bookingan kamar saya. Kemudian beliau lsg menjawab kamar sudah full dan sudah di bookimg org jauh² hari sebelumnya. Dengan artikata berarti mereka PHP saya dong? Kok nga dari jauh² hari pas saya booking lsg blg full aja? Dan juga ada vocer buffet lunch dan dinner yg tidak bisa di pakai dengan alasan belum buka karna pandemi tapi hotel bisa full? Dan pelayanan marketingnya sangat buruk. Saya menanyakan perihal kadaluarsa membership saya, dan dia menjawan bapak kan bisa liat sendiri tgl kadaluarsa di aplikasinya loe kira aplikasi kalian itu spt WA dan IG yg w buka tiap hari??

Waktu didalam lift saya lihat tombol tutup pintu lift nyala, error nampaknya, pantesan nutup sendiri wlwpun ga ada org. Bener aja, setelah saya keluar, ada juga ibu ibu lain yg tangannya kejepit.

"790.","J B","202","2025-12-21","2","Tidak layak untuk merek JW Marriott. Layanan sangat buruk dan staf tidak kompeten. Kamar lumayan, meskipun agak kuno. Makanan dan minuman terlalu mahal. Makanan di bawah rata-rata. Proses check-in dan check-out sangat tidak efisien dan tidak kompeten. Sudah menginap tiga kali dan 2/3 kamarnya ditagih ulang dan masih menunggu pengembalian dana. Prosedur kartu kredit di meja resepsionis buruk. Hindari hotel ini, cari hotel lain."
"791.","Kfir Alkaslasi","6","2025-01-21","2","Ini pertama kalinya saya menginap di hotel ini. Saya datang ke sini untuk bekerja, dan saya tidak menyangka akan mendapatkan hal seperti ini dari Hotel Marriott. Seluruh hotel perlu direnovasi total. Wallpapernya dipotong karena perbaikan yang buruk, kemungkinan besar karena kebocoran, karena kerusakan akibat air terlihat jelas. Karpetnya sudah tua. Kursi di meja resepsionis tergores. Papan sandaran kepala tempat tidur kotor, entah ada kotoran atau sperma (saya bahkan tidak ingin memikirkannya). Dan dudukan toiletnya sudah tua dan rusak. Saya pergi ke mal di sebelahnya dan membeli beberapa bahan pembersih. Ini pertama kalinya saya menulis ulasan buruk tentang suatu tempat dan saya harap ini juga terakhir kalinya saya melakukannya, tetapi Marriott perlu memastikan hotel ini memenuhi standar hotel bintang 5. Saya harus menyebutkan tentang resepsionis yang melakukan hal yang sama di atas dan di belakang karena saya tiba di hotel sangat awal dan mereka tetap mengizinkan saya check-in dan memesan kamar."
"792.","Welly Mulyadi","25","2023-01-21","2","Saya telah menginap di sini 4 tahun yang lalu dan hotelnya luar biasa dan ingin kembali ke hotel ini lagi untuk liburan keluarga kami berikutnya. Sayangnya, kualitas dan kebersihan kamarnya buruk. Tidak seperti menginap di hotel bintang 5 dan lebih seperti bintang 2-3. Kamar mandinya kotor dan bau. Butuh waktu berjam-jam untuk menguras bak mandi. Beberapa sarung bantal dan seprai kotor, dan untungnya kami mengganti seprai & seprai. Beberapa wallpaper terkelupas. Papan skirting kayu kamar mandi rusak. Kulkas berbau. Beberapa stopkontak terlepas. Ruang sauna tidak dirawat dengan baik karena sebagian besar lantai dan kursi kayu terlepas atau hilang. Satu-satunya yang luar biasa dari pengalaman ini adalah sarapannya. Layanan pelanggan yang sangat baik diberikan oleh semua staf dari restoran bahkan makanannya biasa saja. Lokasinya bagus, ada mal di dekatnya."
"793.","Kevin McSmith","37","2024-01-21","2","Sangat mengecewakan. Memesan 2 kamar dan tiba setelah 20 jam perjalanan sekitar pukul 16.30 dan diberi tahu bahwa kamar kami belum siap. Kami berbagi satu kamar dan kamar mandi untuk mandi, dll. hingga kamar kedua siap pukul 18.00. Pergi ke Spa untuk pijat pukul 19.45 dan diberi tahu bahwa mereka tutup. Hotel mengatakan tutup pukul 22.00. Saat check-out, saya memberi tahu staf bahwa saya akan membayar penuh untuk kamar kedua. Mereka mengatakan tidak mungkin mendiskon kamar dengan sistem lama mereka. Mereka memberi sarapan gratis 2x. Seandainya saya punya waktu luang dan tidak ada kendala bahasa, saya tidak akan menerima ini. Kamar tidak siap pada pukul 18.00 sungguh tidak dapat diterima. Tempat tidurnya tidak seperti kebanyakan hotel Marriott lain yang pernah saya kunjungi. Cukup keras dan tidak empuk seperti hotel Marriott pada umumnya. Kamar-kamarnya terawat dengan baik, bergaya lama. Sarapannya 10/10. Bar di lantai bawah kosong melompong pada pukul 20.30. Kecewa"
"794.","marlene fresilia","23","2024-01-21","2","Menginap selama 3 malam, dari hari kerja hingga akhir pekan hingga 22 Juli. Berikut ulasan lengkap saya hingga hari terakhir. SARAPAN: (-) Saya rasa manajer restoran mereka seharusnya mengelola restoran mereka yang sibuk dengan terus memeriksa kebersihan meja dan memeriksa setiap gelas air kosong, daripada menyajikan sarapan di depan tamu. Dalam pengalaman saya, belum pernah melihat manajer yang hanya makan tanpa memeriksa kesiapan meja yang sebelumnya digunakan pelanggan. Catatan untuk manajer Anda, ayolah, ini Marriott. Saya mengamati sarapan Anda selama 2 hari. Serbet, baik Jade maupun sarapan, tidak pernah diletakkan penuh di atas meja. Peralatan makan, gelas, dan mug tidak lengkap. Terkadang Anda harus memanggil staf untuk mengisi gelas, terkadang mereka menawarkan Anda untuk mengisi gelas. (+) Staf dapur sangat baik, rapi, penuh perhatian, dan cepat. Variasi makanannya cukup baik untuk sarapan internasional, India, dimsum, dan 3 menu lokal. Pilihan buahnya sangat banyak. KAMAR: (-) Saya tidak berdaya, saya tidak tahu harus berkata apa. Warna bohlam lampu di kamar saya tidak sama, suhu kamar mandi berbeda dengan kamar terhubung. Perlengkapan kamar mandi seperti sampo, dll. berbeda. Kaca shower hampir pecah, tapi ya mereka memperbaikinya setelah kami menghubungi resepsionis. Sungguh.. Oh juga, kotak tisu kamar mandi berdebu, pegangan bak mandi longgar, AC rusak yang tidak bisa menyesuaikan suhu, yang perlu diperbaiki selama 2 jam, tapi saya tidak mau memperbaikinya dan mengandalkan suhu dari kamar terhubung. (+) Tempat tidur rapi dan bersih, Wi-Fi-nya bagus, kulkas, TV, dan kamar yang luas dan tenang. Mereka memiliki laci yang cocok untuk tamu yang menginap lama. Mohon latih resepsionis untuk memperhatikan dan berbicara dengan pelanggan yang mengantre di concierge karena menunggu ketika staf concierge tidak ada di tempat, meskipun mereka sedang menangani pelanggan yang mengantre (hanya 2 atau 3). Membuang waktu lebih dari 5 menit hanya untuk meletakkan kotak saya tanpa menyapa. Saya tidak keberatan jika resepsionisnya sibuk, tetapi mereka terus mengobrol ketika saya menelepon resepsionis dari concierge, sampai saya harus berteriak keras 2-3 kali agar staf berhenti berbicara dan bertanya kepada saya. Untuk Restoran Jade: Makanannya sungguh luar biasa, staf prianya sangat perhatian. Tetapi saya pikir mereka membutuhkan seseorang untuk berdiri agar tamu dapat dipanggil lebih cepat. Mungkin mereka kekurangan staf? Terakhir, mereka diberitahu bahwa mereka akan melakukan sesuatu di kamar saya untuk ulang tahun pertama bayi saya. Tetapi mereka lupa sampai saya harus mengingatkan mereka dan mencari alternatif lain untuk memastikan saya memiliki kue untuk bayi saya. Dan ya, mereka datang untuk mendekorasi kamar. Terima kasih kepada Mba Enjelica dan pasangannya, saya sangat menghargai itu. Terima kasih atas struk dan concierge Bapak dengan keramahan yang hangat dan mengingat beberapa detail, dapur yang rapi dan staf dapur yang hangat, sempurna. Kami juga menghargai kehangatan dari staf di hari terakhir. Mungkin saya terlalu berharap seperti hotel Marriott lainnya. Hotel ini agak mahal, tapi kerapiannya agak kurang dibandingkan hotel Marriott lain yang pernah saya kunjungi. Semoga bisa diperbaiki secepatnya. Oh, mereka juga mengakomodasi pelanggan untuk memesan sesuatu dari Gojek atau Grab."
"795.","Imam faadh","1","2024-01-21","2","Kolam renangnya sangat kecil dan kolam renang anak-anaknya juga pendek. Kamarnya ada noda di tempat tidur, air kencing yang tidak disiram saat saya masuk, karpetnya penuh remah-remah. Dan kamar mandinya ada jendela? Aneh."
"796.","eviutami mediastika","56","2022-01-21","2","Antrean panjang saat check-in karena hanya ada satu resepsionis yang buka & proses check-in yang panjang untuk setiap tamu.

"797.","Andy Short","9","2017-01-21","2","Perabotan di kamar kami lusuh dan usang, lift mengalami kerusakan parah yang dikeluhkan semua orang, pilihan camilan di minibar sangat buruk, area kolam renang dan spa tampak tidak terawat dan rusak parah, dan restoran penuh sesak karena pesta pribadi sampai-sampai tamu hotel tidak mendapatkan meja untuk makan malam!
