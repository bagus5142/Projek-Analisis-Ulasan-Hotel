"1.","Elianna Franco","1","2025-12-24","3","We had a pretty nice stay at the Prama Hotel overall. Breakfast was okay and a good way to start the day. The pools were a real highlight — plenty of space, comfy chairs, and a great spot to relax. The staff were friendly and welcoming, which made the stay feel pleasant. There were a few small downsides. The WiFi was quite slow and kept dropping out, which could be frustrating at times. The beds were a little uncomfortable, and there wasn’t any conditioner provided. We also had some trouble with the TV connecting to the right network, and when it disconnected it was hard to reconnect. The shower didn’t have much space to put toiletries either. Even with these issues, we still enjoyed parts of our stay, especially the pool area, and with a few improvements it could be even better."

"3.","Krzysztof Łowkis","115","2025-12-01","5","We were in Prama in November 2025. Reception is opened 24h. We arrived at 2am in the night and service was excellent. Room 245 was big - equipped with fridge, smart TV (include Netflix and Youtube apps), electric kettle (coffee, tea and two bottle of water daily replenished), safe box (enough for 14'' laptop), big, comfortable bed. Terrace has two chairs and table. Bathroom is nice, average size with good quality cosmetics. WiFi is available in rooms and all hotel areas - speed enough for Netflix/Youtube. Staff are helpful and professional - after check out you can stay at hotel and use infrastructure (swimming pool, beach etc) and take shower before journey in gym (till 7pm). Breakfast is very good - the choice is large (fruits, egg zone, dishes from Indonesia and Western - fantastic bacon:D) available till 10.30 am. Two swimming pools (one small for babies and parents, second big (with two depths - 1.5m and 1.8m) - good to swimming. Bar avaialble from swimming pool. Width hotel beach with sunbeds, umbrellas and tables. Hotel garden is very big and green with indonesian culture motivies - very climatic:) Bicycle rental available on hotel (50 IDR for two hours, 75 IDR for all day). Nearby the hotel you can find few shops (with clothes and with food) and lots of restaurant (nice place is Linga Longa where you can eat, drink and hear rock/metal live music (start at 8.30pm) in super climatic place. Price in restaurants and bars are high (for Indonesian realitics) - I think should be cheaper (hint - 50m away of hotel beach zone is restaurant where you can buy drinks for a half price and take it away:)):) Bicycles could be better quality (if you rent - check them preciosly before drive outside of the hotel) Besides of this two small things the rest was fantastic and we highly recommend this hotel"

The reception staff are outstanding and let me checkin slightly early to allow me to prepare for a ln event with the new Irish Ambassador. Kadek was great helping me with all my luggage. The service and quality in all the restaurants is consistently good quality each time. The breakfast options are so good also, lots of choice, and fresh , hot. Thank you team once again for another great stay ."
"5.","Santoso RS- G","22","2025-10-31","5","A very nice, large hotel, with a reasonable price, reflecting its quality and service. It's located in Sanur, as the name suggests. Before entering the hotel, you'll pass restaurants and shops on either side of the road, offering a variety of Balinese souvenirs and other necessities. The rooms are clean, smoke-free, and comfortable, with electricity, power outlets, and USB ports for charging gadgets. The conference room is on the ground floor, overlooking the beach. Likewise, the restaurant is on the ground floor, overlooking the beach and pool to either side."
"6.","Alexis Paule","27","2025-12-01","1","I had an extremely upsetting and unacceptable experience with Prama Sanur regarding accessibility for a quadriplegic guest in our group. Before booking, the hotel explicitly confirmed they were wheelchair accessible and even told us which room type to book for a wheelchair user. We booked the hotel based entirely on this assurance. Our guest is 31 years old, quadriplegic, cannot walk, cannot talk, and requires a shower/commode chair and full-time care. We explained all of this clearly, multiple times. Despite this, the hotel later suggested that his shower chair should “remain outside the bathroom,” which is impossible for someone who cannot walk or stand? They also stated the bathroom doorway is 80 cm wide but then claimed his 60 cm shower chair could not fit, a direct contradiction that they could not explain. Even worse, after confirming accessibility before we booked, the hotel then tried to charge us an additional around $500 AUD for a different room that actually met basic accessibility needs. Treating accessibility as a paid “upgrade” is discriminatory and completely unacceptable. Especially after advising us to book a different room prior to this Throughout weeks of emails, we received confusing, contradictory, and unhelpful responses. They repeatedly avoided our questions and eventually left us with no option other than to cancel because the hotel could not safely accommodate a disabled guest, despite their promises before booking. No wheelchair user should ever be told to leave their shower chair outside the bathroom or forced to pay extra just to access the toilet and shower safely. The way this situation was handled was unprofessional, misleading, and inhumane. I strongly advise anyone travelling with accessibility needs to avoid this property until the staff are properly trained and the hotel stops falsely advertising accessibility as something they provide. Disabled guests deserve dignity, safety, and honest information - none of which we received here."
"7.","Molly Richards","38","2025-07-31","5","Hotel is indeed very beautiful, beach and restaurant facilities are beautiful! Staff are friendly and accommodating, rooms are clean, but don’t forget to put your do not disturb sign on the door if you want a sleep in. Great selection for breakfast and pools for all ages. It’s a very populated hotel, a lot of people stay here however all the facilities seemed to accommodate everyone fairly comfortably which was great! Only thing I can possibly fault is that our room was smaller than most other beach resorts we have stayed at and bathroom was hard to move in, perhaps if we upgraded to a bigger room our stay would have been that little bit more comfortable. All in all though we enjoyed our stay and it’s 5 stars from us."
"8.","Sri Mulyani","137","2025-08-31","3","Sama sekali jauh dari standard bintang 5 karena fasilitas hotel sangat minim. Yang 5 stars hanya lokasinya yang dekat dengan pantai (beachfront) dan harga makanan+minuman di restaurant hotel yang lebih mahal dibanding restaurant dengan standard yang sama di sekitar pantai sanur. Hotel dengan bangunan lama, furniture sudah banyak yang usang dan rusak serta perlu perbaikan. Taman area hotel lumayan indah dan terawat dengan baik. Sayangnya kondisi area publik dengan kamar sangat jauh berbeda dan buruk, terutama area kamar mandi. Selama menginap lebih dari 7 hari, saluran air selalu mampet dan menyebabkan air menggenang di lantai kamar mandi. Harus menunggu lama sampai air bisa surut. Benar-benar pengalaman yang tidak menyenangkan. Bidet juga tidak berfungsi dengan baik, air sangat minim. Staff hotel cukup ramah dan helpful, terutama staff wanita yang melayani breakfast. Mereka selalu menyambut dan membantu tamu dengan senyuman hangat meskipun suasana sangat crowded dan banyak permintaan dari tamu. Menu breakfast kurang variatif dan cukup membosankan karena cenderung menyajikan menu yang hampir sama setiap hari. Area swimming pool sangat luas, dan sangat nyaman karena terpisah lokasi pool untuk anak-anak dan dewasa. Untuk kolam renang anak dilengkapi beberapa permainan interaktif diantaranya adalah big water bucket."

"10.","Dan S","65","2025-08-31","5","We have a very pleasant stay at the Prama Sanur Beach hotel. The hotel is well maintained despite the age of the hotel. The room is clean and well presented. Staff are very courteous and accommodating. We like to give special shout out to Ibu Umanik, we think she is the manager in charge of all the restaurants and cafes. Her customer service, attention to details and memory of customers names and needs is impeccable. She will go above and beyond to assist you. I hope someone in management will recognize her capabilities. She deserves a promotion for sure."
"11.","Daryl Scales","122","2025-10-31","4","On had a 2 day stop over but everything was great! My only mention would be that the baked beans on the breakfast buffet were not cooked before being put into the heated basins. (Touch of butter and some S&P works miracles) Besides that the rooms were clean and the staff were very friendly."
"12.","Joshi Gee","4","2025-10-31","1","This place is well overdue for a facelift. Lots of things are in disrepair. Rooms not ready to checkin at the check in time. Decor is extremely aged. Bathrooms not cleaned properly. Our booking was completely stuffed up and had to have a single bed crammed into our tiny room to make up for their booking error. Happy hour differs between different bars of the same hotel. The list could go on forever. Just a big collection of things that could be done a lot better with more oversight. The place is simply very tired."
"13.","Sarah Takeyama","34","2025-08-31","5","The location of this hotel is wonderful. The beach front walk is beautiful, peaceful and has lots of cafes and restaurants to choose from. The rooms are comfortable, could use some more lighting as it’s quite dark inside. Beautiful breakfast and affordable pool side drinks, snacks and room service. Highly recommended for families."
"14.","Cronosh Tag","126","2025-12-17","5","Rasa dan menu jenis makanan/minuman harus diperbaiki. Pantai banyak kotoran (maaf) anjing. Overall bagus."
"15.","Federico Russotto","11","2025-08-31","4","It’s a five hotel but the furniture inside are old (for example there were holes near the lamp at the wall and there was rust around the mirror in the bathroom) and the basic stuff that, off course in my opinion, they have to be available for a such kind of resort are not adequate: only the bigger towels for everything. However, the welcome service was great, they took our luggage and gave us a free drink to wait before our room was ready. They also organised on the beach interesting event (tradition Bali dance where we can took an amazing photos with the dancers) and you can also enjoy fresh pizza cooked in wood hover! Do not forget to mention also the BBQ, even the portion we’re not so generous but the beef was of excellent quality. In conclusion, I recommend this hotel for families: breakfast was excellent, there are two big swimming pools, spa where you can enjoy excellent massage (price little higher than outside in Bali but it worth!), there are games for children."
"16.","ashley reynolds","39","2025-10-01","4","A good 3.5 to 4 star standard. Is an old resort but that's reflected in the pricing. Good facilities, friendly staff. Enjoyed the bamboo bar with live music on the beach every night"
"17.","Victoria Larkin","23","2025-10-31","5","We did not stay at this location but did join for an evening with dinner, entertainment, cultural dance and fireworks as an added bonus. Very family friendly where you can meet your new next best friend watching the tide come in."
"18.","NnNn","33","2025-07-31","3","Beautiful grounds, location was perfect, breakfast was outstanding, the Indonesian night was great. Staff are lovely! All the food and drinks we ordered were excellent, not once was disappointed with quality - thank you to the chefs! The rooms are old and need some love, room 418 has mould on the ceiling, stains on the curtains and lamp shades, broken panel in the wardrobe, easy fixes but not being done. The kids pool area is great but is a bit sketchy, the double slide is a strange angle so you come down smashing your bum at the bottom. The metal safety rails are rusty and feel like they could break, a child would die falling from that height onto the concrete or tile surface below. It felt a bit unsafe overall and needs safety attention overall. The pools in general were lovely if you can get a seat, staff need to stop people claiming chairs before breakfast and then not sitting there until afternoon. One of the guys (older, chubbier) at pool towel desk is very rude and makes you feel like you are inconveniencing his mobile phone scrolling time. There’s no real vibe here, no music, no one drinks at the pool bar. Constantly searching for a staff member by the pool, not many around to order food or drinks. I emailed multiple times to ensure the rollaway bed was added and they confirmed, despite this we arrived after midnight with little kids to still find this not done so we then had to wait around for it. I’ve read similar reviews. The attention to details needs to be better. We will return probably one day but would love to see an improvement to the rooms and kids pool area safety. They are still charging a lot so the money is there to fix things."
"19.","Coco Nishida","4","2025-10-01","3","Lowkey had high expectations for this hotel however it was just a normal stay in my experience. There is more families or older couples here to have a chill time so if you are coming here to party this would not be the hotel to stay at. The location is right on the beach so it is really convenient to go from hotel room to the beach. The staff here are kind and very helpful aswell. The free breakfast is a buffet style with so many different choices, it was also very good and some foods change daily."
"20.","Kita","11","2025-12-01","5","Sari is the best. She and the staff of the hotel always take good care of my grandparents and make sure they have a lovely time. Great pool and right next to the beach."
"21.","MK Arya","46","2025-12-10","5","Hotel ini sangat nyaman park luas, pelayanan humanis, walaupun lokasinya jauh masuk ke dalam,tapi dekat dengan pantai, hotel ini berada di tepi pantai, pokonya mantap."
"22.","Tomy Sugiarto","72","2025-12-10","5","I am a big fan of Prama. I have had the pleasure of visiting prama since I was a wee boy. They have adapted fantasticly throughout the times. Great upkeep, great local hospitality and a wonderful rest and relax destination for families!!"
"23.","ahmad ismail","184","2025-12-01","4","Hotel dengan salah satu pantai yang bagus untuk sunrise, banyak arena bermain anak juga, pantainya bersih dan landai, bayak ketemu bintang ular sejenis bintang laut dan kelomang kecil masih banyak di pantainya"
"24.","Napier Rathbun","8","2025-08-31","5","Bought a day-pass to spend at the pool and splash pads with my wife and 3 y/o daughter. At a cost of 125k rupiah each w/ towel, water bottle and 10% off F&B, plus use of a covered bodega poolside, it was a superb day of play and relaxation. Also the restaurant food and drinks were top quality. Thank you!"
"25.","Uli","98","2025-10-01","4","The hotel is actually nice with a classic touch, but it feels old and really needs some renovation. I got a room upgrade from a male FO staff, which was nice I appreciate it. However, during check-in at 2 PM, my room wasn’t ready. The other FO didn’t update me for almost an hour until I went back to the desk myself turns out the room was ready. She also didn’t inform me about my room floor this hotel is huge or the WiFi password, so I had to figure it out on my own. The room is spacious and classic, but a few things need improvement: the bidet holes were blocked so the spray was painful to use (I even had to clean it myself to make it smoother with toothpick), wooden furniture and doors are noisy, and some areas show mold (like near the socket). The makeup mirror should be placed better, not directly facing the bed. Breakfast has variety but the taste is average, though the pastries are good. On the positive side, staff in general are friendly and polite but need to improves and serve better"
"26.","Jeremy Gilbert","40","2025-07-31","3","The rooms are dated, the check-in experience was not ideal as the room wasn't ready until around an hour after it should have been. Ordered hot food a couple of times that wasn't hot. Had one cold meal taken away to fix, came back cold. People travelling with us had constant trouble with their room, from aircon not working to ants in the beds, dirty bed linen, etc. Staff always seemed to either have no idea how to fix things, or didn't care. The beachfront location is great though, with heaps of restaurants and live music venues around."

"30.","Wendy","2","2025-07-31","3","Staff are fabulous, clean rooms, amenities good. Biggest complaint was that other guests would save multiple pool chairs from 6:30am despite the staff saying that if the seats weren't used within an hour, the towels would be removed. NEVER happened. Staff actually assisted this one woman to put multiple chairs together & spread out inflatable toys on the seats to save every morning!! They remained saved for several hours until her family arrived!! Very frustrating as could rarely get seats by the pool. Won't be staying here again if l can't get near the pool!!!"
"31.","Alneo Lesag","17","2025-12-01","4","Ballroom cukup lega dan sangat dingin. Suasana tidak membosankan karena ada private beach untuk view yg keren"
"32.","Jesslyn Azalia","16","2025-08-31","2","Not the best experience so far. I arrived at the hotel around 3-3.30 PM, which was 1.5 hours after the supposedly check in hour, but i arrived and found out that the room wasn’t ready. Because check out as per my understanding is supposed to be around 11 AM - 12 PM. So I didn’t understand how come with 3.5 hours gap, the room was still not ready. And after entering the room, I found out that the room was very old and most of the furnitures have some chips on some parts, I mean as a 5 stars hotel, it just doesnt make sense. And the toilet was really smelly when i entered. Not to mention the lift wasn’t working."
"33.","Andrew Green","6","2025-08-31","5","Our group (two couples and three kids between us) stayed for a week in mid-August 2025. The resort presents well for its age. Everything is very clean, the grounds well kept and staff friendly (everyone saying hello etc.). Some of the common areas definitely need a refresh. We had a room on the fourth floor of the northern side of the resort, facing the beach/big pool. The room was clean, but somewhat dated and in need of maintenance. We saw some rooms being renovated during our stay, so they're working on that. There's lifts to access the upper levels, but the stairs were more convenient for pool/beach access. The kids loved going to kids club each day. The staff (particularly Elis and Santi) were friendly, caring and attentive. The kids club staff break for an hour for lunch at about 12 (fair enough!), so you do have to pick up the kids for that. Some of the service staff by the pool were on rollerblades (with varying degrees of ability!). At times, service by the pool could be hard to come by. This could be improved with the 'flag and menu' system seen elsewhere (i.e., leave menus permanently at the seats, with guests raising their flag for service). Bike hire from the resort was reasonably priced and the bikes good to ride. We used the resort bikes to get up to the Icon Mall (about a 3km ride north along the beach), where you can park securely and have a wander around. Pay attention to the bike lanes and keep left! The nightly beach activities/entertainment were great (the kids really enjoyed this). There's a 'Bali swing' on the beach for photos/the kids to play on. The breakfast buffet was good. Plenty to choose from and a good fresh egg station. Espresso coffee and a 'crispy bacon' option would not go astray!! The 'Pepito Market' was our go to for supplies (about 300 m east of the main gate). Sanda Spa for massages (just east of the main gate). Jungle Tree restaurant (just across the road from the main gate) was great for dinners with the kids too. Massimo (Italian restaurant) was fabulous for pizza and ice cream. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at the resort and we will definitely be back."

"35.","Mason","102","2025-07-01","4","It is a nice hotel with very good food and facilities. But I would say it is a bit basic by Sanur standards. It was built in the late 70's and is really showing its age with the basic design and water damage marks everywhere. It is perfectly clean and well maintained with beautiful grounds, it's just not as modern as other hotels next door and down the beach. I would definitely say it is more of a four star hotel than five (which they market it as)."
"36.","Nina W.","4","2025-05-31","5","Wonderful stay – beautiful resort and amazing staff! I had a fantastic experience at Prama Sanur Beach Bali. The staff were absolutely amazing – so warm, welcoming, and helpful throughout the stay. The resort itself is very clean and well-maintained, with beautiful gardens that create a peaceful atmosphere. I especially loved the beachfront location. The pool was great, and the little kids club is super cute and a nice touch for families. Room service was prompt and the food was good. The hotel is also in a great location, just a short walk to shops and restaurants in Sanur. Overall, a lovely place to stay – we will definitely come back!"
"37.","Leanne Merton","10","2025-07-31","1","Best thing about this place is the location.. right on the beach . However the room was well below par ! It had not been cleaned , outside our small balcony was littered with cigar butts yuck , the air-conditioning vents were black and dusty ..I would not recommend for health reasons . Such a shame as i have stayed here previously and it was good ."
"38.","Francesca Bahoum","13","2025-08-31","2","THIS IS NOT A 5 STAR RESORT. There's nothing about this hotel that is 5 star. It needs a desperate refurbishment. We've stayed in 5 star resorts all over the world and this is the worst hotel we've ever stayed in. Paint flaking off the walls, mould in the bathroom, filthy walls in bedroom, rusty nails, dusty, mouldy net curtains, under the bed is filthy - We've got 2 rooms 302 and 306 they are awful. We are a family of 4 so had to have 2 rooms which doubles the cost for us. Most hotels have family rooms that we can all fit in. The kids waterside are rusty, tiles in Kids pool need replacing, several of the other kids pool things dont work or are just very run down. Breakfast- average selection. Nothing special but not terrible. They dont show you to a table so you have to wonder around trying to find an empty one. Lunches are average. Coffee and teas in the bedroom are never topped up. People have been walking in off the street taking sunbeds without paying when they dont even stay here. Staff are friendly and the location is pretty good. Thats about it in terms of how good it is. Still staying here until Saturday but can't wait to leave. Avoid at all costs!"
"39.","Jacob Gilbert","3","2025-07-31","2","I wouldn't recommend this place unless some serious overhauls happen in terms of facilities and staff. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived and an hour later when it was done our sheets were dirty. House keeping rarely changed things that needed changing like glasses, mugs and toilet paper. Our aircon controls didnt work and was stuck on the lowest setting making it unbearably cold, and when maintenance came by they just moved the vents to face to opposite wall instead of fixing the main issue. The pool is a warzone of people fighting over deck chairs one family even going so far as to pay staff to put pool toys out on 7 deck chairs before the pool opened. The only thing this place has going for it is the location as it has great access to the beach and some great music venues although a short walk along the beach will leave you feeling depressed seeing all of the other hotels that outshine the prama."
"40.","Linda Leard","8","2025-10-01","1","Overall poor value for money plus tip! Rooms are same price as Australia but you get so much more in Australia, including water you can drink or put in the kettle, with milk & complimentary biscuits. The air conditioning is stuck on freezing, the room stank of mildew so they shoved a perfume air block thing in the ac vent - I am now finding mildew/ mould on the bathroom doors so they're sending someone to clean that up. There's no instructions for wifi, no map for finding your way around the resort. Tired & down for dinner & no complimentary water with meal - yes- you're paying for that too- if yr foreign, yr a walking $ sign. Ordered sate on sate night - 6 sticks with a tablespoon of cold, lumpy, peanut sauce- asked for more, and the 2nd lot was hot, lumpless & a more generous serve - prices with tax & service make it - similar to Aus and again, Aus quality is so much better including simple things like a glass of water. Travelling solo but room price includes 2 breakfast & I cant be credited for the 2nd breakfast or exchange it for a coffee! Definitely, not my accommodation or destination of choice - when you factor in the airfare and time travelling, a Australian beachside holiday is as cheap or cheaper, better value & better quality 😉 But wait....there's more - this is the remote control - just a great big chunk of old mould!!! I just dont get it...its hard to believe the 5/5 reviews are legit- just sayin..I have photos but cant post Staff a gorgeous, of course, not their fault - I'm paying the dollars, they're not earning the dollars -someone in the middle's ripping us both off!"

"42.","Deborah Griffith","8","2025-08-31","5","This hotel has great facilities for any type of family. The rooms are starting to show their age and are on the small size however, the activities and location are the reason to stay there."
"43.","M&mC","43","2025-07-01","2","- This hotel is not a 5 star one. It very outdated and the rooms are worn out. - Cleanness also is a matter at the communal areas! - The pool is full and the benches are not enough for all tenants. - The food at the restaurant is also average. We tried the clue sandwich and the pizza were poor. - Breakfast is good but still only black coffee as an option and we had to ask 3 times."
"44.","Randy Balsmeyer","86","2025-07-01","5","Spectacular location and beautiful facilities! Two gigantic pools, one specifically for children. Three restaurants, beach bar, direct beach access. Can’t beat this location! The spacious grounds & gardens are beautifully maintained. Rooms are very nice, but slightly dated. We had a ground floor room with balcony overlooking pool and beach, and it was great! Breakfast at beach restaurant terrific with many options."
"45.","novida nurmayanti","50","2025-07-01","3","Hotel ini memang unggul di lokasi dan fasilitas yg kumplit,, cuma pelayanannya kurang ramah. Sambil nunggu kamarnya ready, sy diberi voucher welcome drink, kata receptionya bisa ditukar cafe dekat pantai. Sy menuju kesana, pas sampe cafenya, dipingpong sm petugasnya. Serasa mereka males ngurusin hal kyk beginian, karna mereka lg sibuk ngurusin pesanan bulebule (fyi, disana banyak wisatawan asing) Seharusnya cukup ambil vouchernya dan bilang utk sy menunggu. Lalu sambil menunggu sy duduk dimeja pinggir pantai. Tidak lama datang 1 gelas kecil minuman, pdhl ada sy sm suami dan anak. Lalu sy tanya.. (dgn sopan nanyanya) “ ka 1 voucher berapa gelas?” Dia menjawab dgn malas2an “ 2 bu , nanti sy ambil 1 lagi “ Heloo kenapa gak sekalian aja tdi… Petugas di pool juga gak ramah. Reception juga gak ramah. Yg jaga pintu dan security lobby juga gak helpfull. Dy gak mencoba bantu waktu kita kesulitan masukin koper ke mobil. Posisi lobby depannya tangga. Saat sy kesana jg Ada bule yg bawa koper kabin sampai jatuh ditangga karna ribet bawa koper dan sblmnya gak dibantuin. Baru pas jatuh dibantuin. Yg lumayan ramah ibu2 yg jaga di depan saat breakfast. Dy juga nyapa tamu2. Berkah utk hidupmu bu, karna memperlakukan org lain dgn baik. Dan helpfull. Kondisi kamar luasnya cukup, tapi ya itu karna hotel lama furniture dan ambiencenya hotel lama. Cuma masih terawat. Disini jg menyediakan Sewa sepeda, 50rb per sepeda yg bisa dipake utk jalan2 di sanur. Kolam renang oke dan banyak. Cuma kolam renang di tempat anak yg ada perosotan harus banyak dimaintanance lagi. Menu breakfastnya standar hotel bintang 3-4"

Had previous occupants receipts/dirt under bed within eye distance, bins not cleaned over, shower & bathroom had a lot of mould, easy to rub off. Ceiling (painted over) and ac vents had mold, tho was cool. Balcony was needing a refurbished as balcony steel work was eroding. Restaurants and pool/gardens beautiful."
"49.","Andre Aprillano","46","2025-07-31","3","This property is older style ones in Sanur Area. Its rated 5 stars but I think 3 stars Max due to physical property conditions. The service is excellent however We did not have a good rest here due to the fact that the AIRCOND is not able to cool down the room. We asked for a technician who came and tried to fix it. We ended up upgraded to club room which the air cond also unable to cool down the room. Tired to change room again, we decided to stay. The pool area is old and need a makeover. Breakfast is little bit chaotic. Location is beach direct. Will choose somewhere else in the future as We need a good rest during our holiday."

"52.","Caspar Y","37","2025-07-01","1","My recent stay at this five-star hotel, during an international research conference, was significantly disappointing due to several issues. Facility Condition The hotel appears old and lacks basic maintenance. I observed a leak in a hallway. In the room, the hairdryer didn't work, the bathroom power socket was dead, and all other power sockets were loose. The security lock was broken, and the fridge was excessively loud. Staff and Conference Organization Staff generally lacked pleasantness and smiles, suggesting a need for improved guest interaction training. During the conference, directional signs were unclear and remained up even after the event concluded, pointing to a lack of efficient management and clear responsibilities. Strongly recommend avoiding this hotel."

Kamar bersih, kolam renang nyaman buat anak2 dan dewasa, breakfast lengkap. Saran sedikit saja, sarung bantal dan sprei mungkin bisa dibuat lebih bersih dan wangi lagi, karena terkesan baunya kurang sedap. Overall 9/10"
"57.","Rana Samedi","14","2025-07-01","3","It's a decent resort to stay at however its very basic. The bathroom has mould and hasn't been cleaned properly in a long time (stains on glass, shower head etc). The buffet breakfast is decent, however the restaurants on the resort (for lunch or dinner) serve below average food and drinks. We chose to eat outside of the resort mainly as the food was very disappointing."
"58.","Ernest Davis","207","2025-03-31","5","Loved this place. Big resort, was quite full (92% capacity) with a conference, but handled it well. Resort is right on the beach front, has 2 pools. I think it could use more sun lounges, as they get 'claimed' early in the morning before people even eat their breakfast 🤦. Food was good, large variety. Lots of staff. Try to eat before 8/8.30am, can get busy. I was upgraded from a seaview deluxe to a seaview suite due to the overbooking from the conference. Beautiful large room overlooking the pool and beach. Shower worked well, bed was comfy, ac was cold. All the staff were friendly. From the front desk to the room attendants. You can walk outside and a little ways down the road and find restaurants, coffee shops, bars, salons. I didnt explore the beachside options but they looked hood from my morning walk. I would stay here again in a heartbeat"
"59.","Anne Wis","4","2025-05-31","5","What a wonderful 7 night stay at the Prama. The location is perfect, the grounds are beautiful, food including the buffet breakfast was delicious. The best thing about this hotel is the staff! Our family has been to Bali a few times and I have to say that the staff at the Prama are the best. They are happy, kind and attentive. A special thank you to the wonderful duty manager Iswartiono, who went above and beyond to return some lost property to us. The Lewis family will most definitely be returning to the Prama hotel."
"60.","Micaela Blanco","28","2025-07-31","2","If you dont expect it to be real 5 star hotel, it will be just fine. The house keeping deparment is just terrible. When check in, the fridge in the room was dirty (I did complain and they clean it after 3 days) Everytime they refresh the room, leave the pillows on the floor (which in some parts was full of ants) The service was ok, the restaurant was slow, the coffee cold and they did not know how to manage complains. If I need to highlight something, was the pool, and the pool for the kids. And the location If also great, I found Sanur amazing for family."

"62.","Purwa","56","2025-05-01","5","Satu kata yang menggambarkan hotel ini : LUAR BIASA. Hotel terletak persis di depan pantai, jadi anak pasti senang menginap di hotel ini karena ga perlu jauh jauh untuk main pasir dan berenang di laut. Oh ya, pantainya juga bersih dan masih ada remis di pinggir pantainya loh..😊 Dari kamar dan bangunan sepertinya hotel ini merupakan hotel lama yang terus mengalami pembaruan dan renovasi sehingga tetap bersih dan terawat. Kamar juga sangat kedap suara, terbukti ketika anak saya menangis, tidak terdengar sampai keluar. Untuk sarapan juga bervariasi dengan rasa yang lumayan enak. Yang jagoan dari hotel ini adalah fasilitas lain yang ditawarkan. Selain memiliki pantai pribadi, hotel ini juga memiliki kolam renang yang besar dan bersih. Yup, benar benar bersih dengan kadar kaporit yang cukup kecil. Terdapat 2 kolam renang besar dan 2 kolam renang anak dengan tong tumpah dan perosotan di kolam ini, bayangkan anak anda pasti puas berenang di sini. Hotel juga dilengkapi dengan taman yang luas, jadi anak anda dapat bermain di rumput tanpa alas kaki. Bagi yang ingin bermain di indoor juga tersedia playground. Setiap malam selalu ada live performance yang ditampilkan di depan bamboo beach cafe. Jadi setiap tamu yang ada di sini juga sangat terhibur. Dari 5 kali kunjungan saya ke Bali, sudah 3 kali saya menginap di hotel ini. Pada kunjungan kedua, kami menginap selama 2 minggu dan masih terasa kurang lama menginap di hotel ini, saking betah dan lengkap fasilitasnya. Terima kasih untuk Prama Sanur Beach Bali, telah membuat perjalanan kami menjadi berkesan,, semoga selalu sukses..😊🙏"

Other guests have the habit of leaving their pool towel on the sun beds for hours, or not using them at all. Very frustrating. Beds and pillows were good. Not all staff here is as friendly as we are use to, but Bali has gotten very touristic so I don’t blame them. I’ve been coming to Bali the last 25 years to visit friends and a lot has changed, maybe too fast too."
"64.","Nivilia Dayoh","6","2025-05-01","5","I stayed at this hotel for 3 days & 2 nights with my family. The hotel is very nice, the room facilities are complete. The staff was also very helpful when I requested an iron. The hotel also has a playground, which was great since I have a 2-year-old child, and we really enjoyed this facility. The hotel is located in Sanur, very close to the beach so we could enjoy beautiful sunrise/sunset views. The breakfast was complete with options for kids, and the food was delicious. I loved the pork bacon! xoxo."
"65.","Huyen Do","294","2025-03-03","4","This is the second place we stayed during our Bali's trip. Pros: - Beach front hotel - Big hotel with many facilities - Nice location, we didn't have time to explore the neighborhood, but it seems very lively, near the Icon Bali, there are a lot of stores and shops close by too. - Beach bar and restaurant with live stage at night is very nice. Cons: - Rooms and facilities are quite outdated. The hotel need renovations. - When we stay at the hotel, they have some renovation/building just outside of our room (irony I know). So we had to close the curtain all the time for privacy. There are sometimes loud noises too, but I think they did try to keep it to minimum. - Kid/family activities: I asked the front desk and they introduced us the kid club. But actually there is no schedule activities for kids/family. The kid club can take care of small kids during their operation hours when you sign up for it. - Service: is so so, but to compare it to our previous hotel it fell a little short. Other note: because of tide, check with the hotel the time when you can go swimming at the beach."

"70.","John Barnes","74","2025-10-31","2","Hotel a bit dated. Breakfast is chaotic. Many guests lay down their towels at the pool loungers very very early and then don't use them all day. Would not return to this hotel."
"71.","L.A. Xavier","57","2025-05-31","4","Have stayed in the Prama twice now to surf Baby Reef in Sanur and for their huge compound, many amenities and strategic location the pricing compared to the other resorts on the Sanur Beach stretch is a great deal with the hotel being right on the beach and next to many great restaurants and even the Ripcurl surf school. That said their hotel rooms itself are very outdated with bad air conditioning, little cockroaches in the bathroom and damaged wooden tables, walls, floors and doors however the hotel is old so this is somewhat expected. Not exactly a great romantic getaway for young couples but definitely recommend for large families and groups."

The room’s definitely needed refurbishment The AC makes loud noise but less cooling. The toilet tub although clean looks very old, like from the 90s.

The breakfast buffet, served by attentive staff, features an excellent selection of Indonesian cuisine. It has grounds, a pool, and beachfront views. The hotel's prime position provides convenient access to the city center, shops, restaurants, the boardwalk, Sanur Beach, and other attractions. 15 minutes to Icon Mall. The room appears worn and antiquated. The internet speed is quite slow for work."

The location is excellent with a nice sand beach and ability to swim in the ocean, has several large pools and a decently outfitted gym. The hotel is a bit dated and needs to be refreshed. The ceiling of our room had cobwebs, the walls were dirty and patched (needed new painting everywhere) the aircon vent dripped water on the floor. The breakfast offered lots of options but was the same everyday, the coffee wasn't great and the juice was sugar water, but the price and location was great."

Linga Linga - for suckling pig (at Prama entrance) Jungle tree - satay skewers (at Prama entrance) Soul in the beach - all food is amazing (near Icon)"

Don't get me wrong we had a great stay, the facilities are great and keep you at the hotel. The biggest problem for me is the lack of cleanliness, bedroom, reception, communal areas, the pool, all toilet areas etc. just because it's old and needs a facelift, is no excuse for being dirty. Staff need training. There is a lack of continuity. The beach bar is advertised open to 10.30 however from 9.30, staff are moving you on, very abruptly, to close early. I thought the breakfast and food generally was good. Regards Helen &John"

"87.","Mark","166","2025-05-01","3","Friendly staff. Amenities and rooms are worn and outdated but good for the money if you get a discounted booking. The drinks and food are way overpriced even for a resort. $6.20 AUD including tax for a beer is just greedy. Buffet breakfast is ok with a great omelette station. The Italian restaurant is very bland and had no flavour. Bamboo bar is a nice spot to sit but expect overpriced drinks as above."

The staff were exceptional, especially Mr. Juliana at the Tirta Restaurant and Ms. Peni at the front office. They were truly awesome! I'll definitely be coming back!"

This expansive resort hosts many rooms and beautifully maintained gardens. This facility caters to couples, singles and families with a large sized kids pool with slides and play equipment. The adults appreciated the swim up bar. The only suggestion I would have is to have a time limit on the sun lounges as some guests leave a towel on it all day and go out. It was difficult to get a sun lounge at times. The drinks and food service staff on rollerblades was fun and efficient. Good variety of food for breakfast and the staff were very friendly and helpful. It was a short walk to get a massage, haircut and to enjoy delicious local food (Babi Guling) and live music at Linger Longer and the Fire Station Bar and Grill."

"94.","Stephen Castellas","10","2025-05-31","3","Negatives : The rooms are very run down although you get what you pay for so that was fine. The AC was horrible!! I asked to upgrade my room to a cooler room (at a cost) I was shown 2 more rooms that were just as bad. Then I was taken to a club room which was definitely better but still very average. We requested a fan which was done quickly. It made the room bearable. But definitely not cold. Drinks are expensive at the pool and bar. Pizza at the hut was very average. Like a good frozen pizza. No smart tv in the club room but in the standard room. Positives : Pool area was amazing! Huge and right next to the beach. Just make sure you claim a day bed super early as people leave their towels and leave for hours. The staff were friendly and very helpful. Bed was comfortable. Club room is a nice size. Great location with walking distance to the main street area. Scooter parking was safe."

One of the highlights of my stay was the hotel's dining options. The breakfast buffet was extensive, with a wide variety of fresh and delicious choices. I also dined at the hotel restaurant for dinner, and the food was exceptional. The service in the restaurant was top-notch, with the staff being both knowledgeable and friendly."
"99.","Jerry Sanderson","13","2025-05-31","4","Funny isn't it reading reviews..... I've been staying at this hotel once or twice a year pre covid 2018 & 19. Post covid once a year for 4 weeks. And we sometimes go twjce a year or more fir a few days depending on circumstances. We always stay in the Krisna wing as the rooms are bigger . Ok yes the rooms are a little tired but hey you don't go on holiday to stay in your room. They have everything you need I've always had a a nice comfortable room with a big king bed & the AC has always been ok & the bathrooms are good. Big attraction for us is it's on the beach so you do get the breeze . I swim early every morning in the huge pool. Breakfast can get a bit samey but we do stay for 3/4 weeks. Ok yes the bar prices are a bit in the high side. But hey just go out either along the beachfront or into the main street. We always hire bicycles from my local guy on the main street as much cheaper. The staff are always very polite & helpful & we know quite a few of them now as friends. If you are polite and respectable you will be treated the same way. We were there in June last year for a month and we have booked again for a month Oct/Nov. Only thing to be mindful of is the Australian school holiday times as it's popular with families as we are older in our mid 50's we avoid those times. An overall 4 stars from me. 😀"

The beach is very clean and fantastic. However, the jet skiing is extremely annoying when there are 4-5 jet skis and you can hardly catch your breath on the beach, it smells of exhaust fumes. We had booked a deluxe room but unfortunately we got one on the first floor as the high ceilings were musty. After a consultation with the reception, we were allowed to move to the third floor the next day where everything was very good. very nice room great view.

Ketika komplain minta pindah, pelayanan lama sekali, sampai 1 jam lebih baru diberi kamar lain. Dan kami jg punya pengalaman tidak enak dgn petugas parkirnya. Kami mau parkir di dekat lobi, disuruh pindah dengan nada yg tidak enak, dengan alasan itu untuk parkir mobil ambulan?? Kalau pun nyuruh pindah, nadanya yang enak, bahasanya yang sopan apa ga bisa?? Bapaknya kurus, pakai kacamata. Yang terburuk adalah, ketika hendak bersantai di Pantai belakang hotel, ternyata bau sampah sepanjang hari. Di dekat hotel ada tempat pembuangan sampah, dan baunya sampai ke area kolam renang, tempat breakfast, dan Pantainya. Breakfast dengan aroma sampah. Parah banget. Ga akan balik lg."

"116.","Ilo Vredenburg","30","2025-01-31","3","The property undeniably has charm, but it is evident that it has aged. While the loving, authentic friendliness of the staff makes up for many of the minor and major flaws, there are still some issues worth mentioning: • Water leaks through the ceiling, • Filters and ventilation systems show signs of neglect, • Cleaning is rather superficial. Guests booking all-inclusive should be prepared for some limitations: the selection of food and drinks is limited, service takes longer, and cocktails differ both in presentation and recipe. Particularly noticeable: the breakfast area does not offer enough capacity for all guests, leading to crowding and waiting times. Despite all these shortcomings, the warmth and dedication of the staff overshadow the flaws. It’s hard to stay upset with them – the team is clearly doing their best to ensure guests have an enjoyable stay. With some renovation and better organization, this property could once again reach its full potential."

Overall, Hotel Prama provides a memorable and superior hotel experience. Highly recommended!"

"120.","Jeremy Harsono","19","2025-05-01","5","Good hotel fr perfect for those who love to have healthy habit in the morning cycling for 15km the bike path on the beach are very long which is 15km it's even conneccted to Icon mall so u can cycle to icon mall from the beach even mak beng resto also can go from the beach, room was nice old but gold but maybe the bed should be cleaned better cause I see stain on the bed sheet and pillow and bed sheet and pillow smell kinda funky but over all the room was nice everything work there's is also smart TV. There's a restaurant in the hotel that can serve food for you when u chillin on the beach and there's big pool and u can rent a bike and their bike very nice 50k for 2 hour and u already get MTB polygon bike but some bike are very bad one of my family ride the street bike and feel down on the beach because the bike was unstable and wheel was slippery and MTB bike some of the bike has rusty metal,the street bike are the worst they are rusty unstable but I choose the nice one last time which is MTB polygon that are in great condition. They also have lounge but their lounge was not well maintained cause it's a bit dirty and the pool table has broken side frame and the wood already too weak I rest my hand on the edge to shoot a ball and it crack cause it's to old and theres a dart on the wall but the dart that u throw and no where to be found. Breakfast was nice pretty a lot variety but it's very decent nothing really surprised me but the food was decently great this hotel perfect if you wanted to have lot of activities"
"121.","Hannah","174","2024-12-31","3","If you’re looking for a busy resort with hundreds of kids, this is the spot. The rooms were okay, very dated but the bed was comfortable. Service mostly friendly but the lady at reception when we checked in was not helpful. Pool was big but a bit dirty at the bottom, chlorine level was lower than drinking water… Good beachfront location and range of food at buffet breakfast though."
"122.","Renee Stearn","36","2025-01-31","4","Just did 5 nights at the Prama in a deluxe ocean view room. The room was older style and had a mould smell it was surfacer clean but definitely not 5 star standard. The breakfast was standard and the food was eatable but not fabulous. A great pool area and great location and all the staff was amazing and very friendly."
"123.","Denyse Wilcox","73","2025-05-31","3","Service in Prama cafe non existent. Other hotel restraunts excellent. Nothing outstanding about the room other than the Visiting cockcroach. Pool area very good and very nice beachfront . Concierge excellent Good for those that like large hotels."
"124.","Baby Riedel","13","2024-12-31","1","It is very dated and dirty. My room needs a deep clean and maintenance. The pool is very exposed with no trees or shade. You can feel the heat radiating onto your face. The the resort is very large with small rooms so there is a huge amount of people and it is hectic at breakfast, so many people helping themselves at breakfast so there is quite some rude and stressed guests. Quality and hygiene of breakfast is questionable. The fridge in my room is so noisy I had to turn it off. The sheets have stains. I didn’t even want to imagine what was beneath the sheets given how dirty everything else is. The kids club didn’t excite my 4 and 7 year old and we left straight away. The kids water park is small and dated. Definitely not worth the rating it has. I would not recommend this hotel."
"125.","Bel","5","2025-05-01","1","Possible the worst hotel I have stayed in. Definitely not worth the $130 per night should be priced at $20 per night… mould on the walls and floor in room and bathroom had mould. Aircon smelt terrible probably also very mouldy. Reception staff not helpful at all (couldn’t even organise a taxi for us to go to the airport). Pool is so old looks nothing like the photos and slides totally not safe for young children. Will never be staying here again. Also location not very close to main part of town. No idea who this hotel is rated so high it’s more like a 0 star."
"126.","Meg G","22","2024-12-31","5","Amazing location right on the beach, staff were really friendly and accommodating. The pools are wonderful, one huge lagoon style pool and another large pool as well as a small kids pool and a kids pool with slides. Close walking distance to everything and right on the beach. Thank you for a lovely stay! ☺️"
"127.","Steph EGro","106","2025-05-31","4","The hotel and rooms are dated but it’s actually on the beach with lounge chairs and pool access. Breakfast was good and had many options. I would stay here again:)"
"128.","Teresa Rivera","35","2024-12-31","5","I went with my family to Prama Sanur and it had everything we needed! Rooms were spacious and staff were attentive to our requests. We appreciated the variety of restaurants they had on-site (the Italian one of the beachfront was a favorite) so it didn’t get tiring. The live band on the beach near to Bamboo Bar was also a plus to the ambiance. Best of all, it’s located on the beachfront of a more quiet and calm part of Sanur. Lots of things to see and do within walking distance. Highly recommend them also for events!"
"129.","W D","56","2024-12-31","5","Oldie but a goodie, far from modern but we found our room very clean with comfy bed & linen. All staff in general fantastic, plenty of food options. Breakfast menu a bit boring by day 3, pools are generally clean but could use a vacuum. The whole place needs a bit of love but by no means run down, good value overall."
"130.","Essy J","10","2025-03-31","1","We stayed in the hotel for 4 nights had really ugly experience the room and beds are dirty everything is old everywhere is full of dead insects 🐞I think they don’t believe in cleaning the hotel would never go back again. Kids pool was okay my daughter had fun but because of the weather we couldn’t go pool so we had to stay indoor . I felt like it’s not hotel it’s retirement home . Such ugly smell everywhere"
"131.","Graciela D","237","2024-12-31","4","Pertama kali datang tidak ada staff yang membantu membawa tas koper saya. Dengan posisi bertangga susah saya menarik nya. Untuk yanga ada penyakit syaraf terjepit pinggang dan leher jelas ini membuat otot nyeri dan langsung kambuh. Masa hotel bintang 5 staff yang membantu tamu di awal kedatangan tidak ada? Mohon berbenah. Baru kali ini mendapat perlakuan spt k ini di hotel bintang 5 bali. Setelah di resepsionis dijelaskan kamarnya lantai .. Naik lift lalu belok. Ya saya bingung lah, untung ada staff yg akhirnya mengantar. Untuk breakfast lumayan ada menu vegetarian segala. Cuma tidak ada mesin kopi. Kl mau minta kopi harus minta ke staff nya dulu dan ini tidak praktis menurut saya. Kenapa kopi dan teh panas tidak ditaruh di tempat saja? Breakfast mulai 06.30- 10.30. Untuk towel ada kartu nya. Kl mau pinjam lg handuk harus dikembalikan dl. Kelebihan hotel ini adalah beach front. Cuma tidak ada yg berenang di pantai. Karena dangkal dan banyak seperti tanaman di lautnya. Oya plusnya kl anda beruntung bisa ketemu biota laut ada kepiting kecil, ikan putih kecil. Hotel pada saat saya menginap ramai sekali di pagi hari seperti ada acara wisuda2. Oya kamar nya susah setting suhunya kadang ac dimatiin bisa kadang tidak bisa. Jadi untuk yg tidak tahan dingin bisa merinding apalg kl menginap sendirian ada lukisan orang tua dan ayam agak gimana gt feelnya. Oya kamar mandinya air selalu menggenang"
"132.","Sigit Susetyo","103","2024-12-31","5","Sangat-sangat puas menginap di hotel ini. Lokasinya sangat strategis, bagian belakang lgsung menghadap pantai. Terdapat dua kolam renang besar. Sarapan pagi sangat enak, dan sangat ramah untuk pengunjung yg beragama islam. Ada live musik setiap hari di sore hari di restorannya. Kekuranganya bagi saya adalah tidak ada colokan listrik di dekat kasur."
"133.","Putu Widyari","72","2025-03-03","5","Salah satu hotel di daerah sanur. Waktu itu saya kesini karena antar suami wisuda yang bertempat di salah satu aulanya. Hotelnya luas dan asri.

"134.","andre","6","2024-12-31","4","Great resort! nice food, nice accommodation They forget to clean the rooms sometimes which makes us go to reception and ask manually The beach is a little dirty so we have to walk 5 minutes to swim But rest is perfect, great pools, good service, friendly staff, tight security and close to food and drink and major streets/shops overall steady high end resort that i would recommend"
"135.","Angga PandeTM","6","2024-12-31","5","I had an amazing stay at this hotel! The staff were incredibly friendly and went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable. The rooms were spacious, clean, and beautifully decorated. The amenities were top-notch, especially the pool and fitness center. The location was perfect, close to major attractions and public transportation. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great experience."
"136.","Matt Dellamalva","202","2025-01-31","5","Didn't stay at the hotel so can't comment there, but have got a day pass here a couple of times over the years to use the pool.

"137.","Aza Manding Karjo","28","2024-12-31","4","Lokasi strategis, halaman hotel luas, kolam renang ada untuk anak dan dewasa. Cocok menginap bersama keluarga. Untuk makanan sekelas hotel *5, masih kurang variatif. Pemandangan bagus."
"138.","Paul Gayton","118","2024-12-31","3","Hotel is looking a bit tired. The grounds are lovely and well maintained. The staff are great and helpful. The main pool is great but very difficult to get a lounge by it. The drinks are about double to what you pay at most places. Rooms are good but a bit dark."
"139.","Scott Wellever","86","2024-12-31","5","The breakfast alone is well with every rupiah - can't wait to go back! The beach & pools were perfect for all ages of the family (5 - 70 years old included). Staff went above & beyond regularly. Rooms & bathrooms were always very clean, & the different bands rocked it every night!! Thank you so much!"
"140.","A-tom","56","2024-12-31","3","We booked this place, then I read the reviews and felt a bit worried. Now that we've arrived, we're pretty happy. As other reviews say, it's a bit tired, but not too bad at all. We booked a basic room, which is large enough for two people, cool, comfortable, and has a good view over the garden. Bed is comfortable, beach area clean, service has been great so far, and the pool by the beach is awesome. Close to restaurants. Sanur is way more chilled out than kuta or seminyak etc. For the money, this place is great value. 5 star is misleading though. One thing to note, this is a very busy place utilised by the locals including outdoor corporate events and weddings that can have loud music, although they seem to shut things down by 10pm. 3 stars, we enjoyed and would come again, but not a '5 star' resort... plus there were a number of corporate events during our stay which were very loud."
"141.","kirsty garnaut","33","2024-12-31","5","Wonderful accommodation for a great price, the resort grounds were beautiful and extremely well maintained, the room was immaculately clean and the views of Sanur Beach were spectacular from our balcony. There are multiple lifts to choose from for easy accessibility to all amenities, the pool was huge and well maintained and the buffet breakfast was delicious with a huge selection to choose from. The location was great with plenty of shops and cafes/restaurants within walking distance and the staff were very friendly and helpful. I will be back again and highly recommend The Prama to everyone."

"143.","Raimond Laiv","8","2024-12-31","4","Ideal location right next to beach. However, the hotel itself is a 3 star hotel by European standards. The rooms and facilities are old and need urgent renovation. The thing that annoyed us the most was the lack of lighting in our room. You can not read a book in your room after the sun has set! Just ridiculous"
"144.","Tara Tara","387","2024-12-31","4","Old style hotel dengan fasilitas yang cocok utk anak anak. Kolam renang area cukup luas, breakfast area jg luas dengan rasa BF nya Ok lah. Kids club bersih. Kamar oldies dan luas banget,jadi menuju kamar2 nya agak jauuuh."
"145.","Norbert Zimpfer","96","2023-12-31","3","The hotel itself is in an awesome location. Pleasant looking at first glance but in serious need of an overhaul. The pool areas are great and your kids will be entertained for weeks. The beach area was not cleaned and a lot of debris that washed ashore stayed there. Blue bottleneck jelly fish and water snakes are present and warned about. The restaurants are also great, just the menu choices are limited. Breakfast buffet was a free-for-all but tasty. The rooms are another issue though, very dated and tired looking. A bit on the filthy side. We stayed in a deluxe room, I hate to think what a standard room looks like. Very 80's looking rooms. The common areas are also in need of a refreshing, the patchwork tiles are a joke where the proper colors were unavailable for cracked tiles repair. Reminded me of something I saw in East Germany back in the day. The staff is super friendly and value for money was not too bad overall. Definitely NOT a 4 star hotel, I would rate it a 2+."
"146.","Arun Tanksali","262","2024-12-31","4","The rooms are a mixed lot. Some tired and some renovated. The location makes up for it all. The boardwalk and the large number of restaurants in a few minutes walking distance makes it a great place. The beach is literally a minutes walk away without any public roads in-between."
"147.","Rina Triana","133","2024-12-31","4","Kedua kali nya menginap disini krn ada acara kantor. Toilet bocor. Sudah telp resepsionis harus sampai 2x baru diperbaiki. Pemandangan bagus sekali.

I have a leg injury and they loaned me a wheelchair and the staff was very accommodating. Like the band at the bar nice atmosphere. Breakfast was very good fresh and for all tastes. Private beach was great did not use the pools but they looked great."
"151.","mariska husada","7","2025-01-31","1","The building has an old yet well-maintained appearance, but the service was disappointing. Upon checking in, we requested an extra bed and were promised it would be ready within 15 minutes. However, after 1.5 hour, it still hadn't arrived. When we contacted the operator, they simply said they would check with housekeeping and told us to hang up. Additionally, we inquired about spa treatment packages, but the operator could only transfer us to the spa department, which didn’t pick up the phone after three attempts. Despite this, the operator kept connecting us back to the spa. We then approached the receptionist, and the information the operator had given us about the spa being open turned out to be incorrect—the receptionist informed us that it had already closed. The hospitality was lacking, and there is a significant need for improvement in product knowledge and service quality."
"152.","Nuridawati","5","2025-01-31","3","Been to many hotel, the front staff in this hotel is worst (no smile or whatever). Upon check-in at 2pm sharp the room wasn't ready, normal hospitality will apologize for the inconvenience but the staff there were just the room not ready yet. Thats it, we check every 10 minutes and same answer. Till I cannot take it anymore and raised my voice and the staff came approach me for alternative room. Still no apology. The only reason we stayed there because my son love the pool and this is our 3rd stay. Might hv to reconsider other option in the future. The gardener even more friendly than the front office staff."
"153.","Nazheeka Ariana Putri","3","2024-12-31","5","I recently stayed at Prama Sanur Beach Hotel and it was fantastic. The beachfront location offered stunning views, and the staff were very friendly. The clean, comfortable rooms combined modern amenities, and the gardens created a relaxing atmosphere. The dining was excellent, with a great breakfast buffet and a beachfront restaurant serving delicious meals. The pool facilities were also top-notch. I highly recommend Prama Sanur Beach Hotel for a luxurious and peaceful stay in Bali🤍"

Location, its on the beach with other high end hotels, beautiful walkway along the beach with many shops & restaurants,.as well as fun rentals, anything you can think of you will find it, a few closing boutiques too. This hotel is colossal, I mean huge with giant pools. Too much noise at night, loud music. If you have jetlag don't come here!"
"156.","Steven Salway","37","2024-12-31","3","Big budget Hotel with old and new the newest being better rooms and comforts. Bed was hard and we needed a topper placed on the bed for sleeping comforts or be able to rest or sleep which was done when asked to add the topper, the mattress protecter was staned and we not replaced. Breakfast was good but crowded Pools were big and they had some lilos that u could sit or lie on. Beach location Southern end of Sanur 10 minutes walk to shops and restaurants Staff were very to the point and had some difficulty understanding English Taxi cost were charged for calling transport There are other restaurants on the property They had some live entertainment on the beach front."
"157.","Axel IPLV","39","2024-12-31","4","Nice resort with many rooms and many people also. Restaurants are OK, not many many options but dishes are fresh and good. Food and drinks a bit more expensive than what we had in other hotels and restaurants in less crowded places. Rooms are a bit oldish and sheets were stained, but good mattress and overall clean room. Lagoon pool is pretty big but tourists are stupid, leaving their towel all day around the pool to secure the sunbeds… come on guys, don’t be like that ! Beach bar and other installation were OK. Too bad they are renovating the front beach."
"158.","Christian Osman Rasmussen","2","2025-01-31","1","Prama may have once been a 5 star hotel, but it is no longer! There is not a single floor where the tiles are not glued. The toilet installation is at crawling height The bathroom is filthy and we had it cleaned All the sockets and on and off switches are greasy and have not been cleaned for at least 10 years. Do not move the furniture because behind them there are questionable electrical installations and mold It is so disgusting, excuse my language We have told the hotel I have traveled a lot and this is like Hyundai hotel, Ulsan, Korea 1991 only not updated since Hyundai hotel is updated and is 5* Appliances to Hyundai for drawing the parallel. Room 806 and just outside No change if you walk further 😱 Best regards Tina and Christian"
"159.","Michael König","74","2024-12-31","3","We are staying for more than two weeks at the hotel. Here are some general remarks. First the most positive aspect is the pool and the open site with direct access to the beachfront. The garden is very beautiful as well. The service level, especially at breakfast was changing. General remark: Unfortunately, the hotel is a bit outdated. They gave us a room in the ground floor which was smelling a lot after mould. After complaining to them we got one of the nicest room in the upper floor (4th floor) with direct view to pool and sea. Unhappily also this room was not only smelling after mould, but there were serious signs of black mould at the wall. Not very funny, when you travel with a two year old baby. We tried once the Lada Resto restaurant and we were not satisfied. The food was less, prices shameless and as soon as other guests arrived, the service was very poor. Not many guests try the restaurant. There are much better and cheaper options directly in front of the hotel entrance. Service staff was always very friendly and helpful, but sometimes a bit unorganized. So was the housekeeping. Not really good cleaning. Blankets had spots. Towels were, although fresh a bit smelly. There was no electricity plug in the bathroom, so no chance to shave there - that's rediculous. The fridge in the room was very loud, so we had to switch it off at night. Breakfast is okay. I think that every guest will find something. Coffee was awful. Instead of providing a few modern coffee machines, they only serve filter coffee, which is cold. Really a big minus. The pool: Other guests are lacking manners, they block benches near the pool with their towels for the whole day and then go to breakfast in the early morning. The hotel staff should take care of it. In general we enjoyed our stay due to the beautiful pool and garden. Prices per might were okay, but in general prices for food and drinks are high at the hotel and the quality of the food was lower than average."
"160.","HARIWA","2","2024-12-31","5","Saya sangat terkesan dengan lokasi hotel yang berada di tepi pantai Sanur yang indah dan tenang. Kamar yang saya tempati luas, bersih, dan menawarkan pemandangan laut yang menakjubkan. Fasilitasnya juga sangat lengkap, mulai dari kolam renang yang luas, spa yang menyegarkan, hingga pilihan restoran dengan makanan yang lezat. Stafnya sangat ramah dan selalu siap membantu, membuat saya merasa sangat dihargai sebagai tamu. Meskipun ada beberapa bagian kamar yang perlu diperbarui, secara keseluruhan pengalaman menginap saya sangat memuaskan.

"161.","Anita A","17","2024-12-31","5","We enjoyed our stay at Prama. I am 40+ and was here with my son who is 23. We were quite reluctant initially, after reading mixed opinions, and we booked half of our Sanur stay at Prama just to hedge our bets. We enjoyed Prama a lot. Location is great, food is very good, all that you need and our room is really good as well. Absolutely great value for money. Staff is very friendly and attentive. Beach is really good, even though not cleaned every morning it is spaciuous and yiu will find comfy sunbed here if you want to enjoy the beach. Pools are great as well. Hotel area is clean and very pretty with a good vibe. I loved quiet and spacious surroundings, both on the beach and at the pool. Evenings with live music were a great addition to our experience. I wish I booked that hotel for the second leg of our Sanur stay as well. I recommend this hotel and I think I will be back."
"162.","widi aditya","20","2024-12-31","5","Kids friendly resort. The downside is the room quite aged. However, they keep the hygiene and room cleanliness at highest standard. Would recommend this resort for someone who wants to stay at sanur"

The pools is big (they have two pools). The staff is amazingly friendly and super helpful. Food was great, breakfast is nice. The only thing that is unpleasant is the toilet seems a bit smelly (whenever the bidet is turned on). The rest is beautiful. Thank you Prama Team."
"167.","Murray Parker","22","2024-12-31","3","On the good side Prama is in a great location. Staff are wonderful and food is great. Lovely pool and right on the beach. Perfect place to bring kids as they have their own pool with water features. Down side is the deafening music from the bar outside on the beach. You won't be able to get to sleep till nearly midnight. Complaing to reception a waste of time. We had to change rooms. Won't be back"
"168.","abo ssazzo","61","2023-12-31","4","Likely the best place in the area to stay with kids if you're willing to sacrifice a bit on quality and comfort of the amenities. Good play area for kids, plenty of food options, shopping, massage and sport activities around, but the facilities are quite dated. Rooms are large, beds are comfy, but towels have been in use for quite some time. The room decor sends you back to 80s. Good breakfast, staff is nice and attentive. Overall good value for the price. Like other places in Bali, no ramps, so not very comfortable to operate a stroller."
"169.","Frank Leung","112","2024-12-31","3","The best thing about Prama is its location, and it offers great value. Prama is at most a 3 star hotel, situated on a 5 star hotel site. The worst thing about Prama is its garbage dump hidden behind the front parking lot. In our eight days of stay there, we can smell the rotting garbage from our room balcony and the pool area on at least five of the days."
"170.","Trent","26","2024-12-31","3","We are a family of 6 with 4 kids from 3-10yo. The 2 rooms were fine, but the communication from Prama leading up to our stay was very poor. 3 emails / messages without response. Buffet breakfast was good with plenty of options but again, the service was very poor on multiple occasions. The restaurant and bar at the resort is very average for food and drinks. Nice love music and view but walk 5-10 minutes north, and there are much better options for food and drink. Sanur is very relaxed compared to Legian/Kuta/Seminyak area. We enjoyed the more relaxed vibe here."

"176.","Michelle","26","2024-12-31","5","Lingkungan sangat bersih terjaga walaupun hotel tua. Fasilitas anak-anak seru banget. Ada 2 kolam renang. Hotel langsung akses ke pantai. Lokasi hotel cukup strategis apalagi kalau mau ke Bali Zoo atau Safari Bali hanya 20-30 menit saja. Jalan sedikit keluar hotel banyak restoran dan toko-toko souvenir. Oh ya.. Kamar kami sempat banjir karena hujan besar, pipa di balkon sepertinya tersumbat dan akhirnya air masuk sampai keseluruh kamar kami setelah itu kami telp ke Operator dan gak lama housekeeping datang untuk mengecek dan membersihkan kamar kami serta menaruh beberapa keset supaya tidak terlalu becek karena kaami juga bawa 2 anak kecil jadi takut kepleset setelah itu pihak hotel langsung cepat tanggap dan mau memindahkan kami ke kamar lain tapi karena barang kami sangat banyak dan sisa 1 hari lagi waktu menginapnya jadi saya malas pindah kamar dan packing. Keesokan harinya ada pihak maintanance datang ke kamar membetulkan pipa yang ada di balkon tersebut. Sama kalau bisa makanan indonesianya lebih banyak varian supaya tidak bosan. Selama mengingap 5 hari hanya ada nasi goreng/nasi putih, Bihun Goreng/Mie Goreng, Sosis Ayam/Sosis Sapi, Tempe Orek/Telor Balado dan Urap bali. Menunya yaa ini-ini saja..Kalau bisa lauknya ada ayam atau ikan atau daging yang tidak pedas jadi anak-anak ataupun orang dewasa bisa makan.. selama di hotel anak saya sampai males makan karena hanya ada nasi, telor dan sosis yang bisa mereka makan.. atau kadang pancake dan roti. Kalau bisa lebih bervariasi lagi yaa Bapak/Ibu.. Terima kasih untuk semua Staff Hotel Prama Sanur Beach. Semoga kita bisa secepatnya kembali lagi menginap disana 🙏"

We booked superior rooms, and the mattress was hard, and we could feel the springs through the mattress and had to have a topper placed on our mattress in doing this the mattress protecter was noted to have stains on it, a topper was placed over the mattress and protecter. This room cost was $160 Aud per night Booking a taxi or car was too expensive at foyer, so book or ring your own. The hotel has a beach front location Breakfast was hotel standard and can get crowded. The hotel is a short walk to restaurants. The hotel has large pools. The hotel has some in-house restaurants and a nice cafe. Overall, it's probably not our best hotel stay, and I would recommend the above."

"180.","June Jung","56","2023-12-31","4","The hotel is right on the beach, with a nice bar where we can eat and drink (for breakfast too). It has two swimming pools. For my nephew, I chose this hotel as it seemed to have a great kid pool. A bit disappointingly, the slides were smaller than in the pictures. So was the room. Also, I didn’t go into the sea to swim because I was afraid of urchins and jellyfish after seeing a warning sign in the lobby. (I didn’t see anyone out there) Their gym is not well equipped with old equipment. Overall it was good staying there though."

Mau OR jalan pagi tinggal ke belakang hotel menyusuri pinggir pantai 👍😍"
"182.","Feng","57","2024-12-31","5","Semalem mampir ke bar di Prama Beach Hotel di Sanur, dan pengalamannya menyenangkan banget! Lokasinya pas banget di pinggir pantai, jadi bisa sambil menikmati pemandangan laut yang indah dan angin sepoi-sepoi. Suasananya santai dan nyaman, cocok buat leyeh-leyeh sambil menikmati minuman. Pilihan minumannya lengkap, mulai dari cocktail, mocktail, sampai minuman lokal. Saya coba long island ice tea dan rasanya segar banget. Mereka juga punya beberapa camilan dan makanan ringan yang enak, pas buat menemani waktu bersantai. Pelayanannya ramah dan cepat, bikin betah duduk lama-lama. Harganya cukup terjangkau untuk ukuran bar hotel, jadi nggak bikin kantong bolong. Bar di Prama Beach Hotel adalah tempat yang pas buat menikmati waktu santai sambil menikmati pemandangan pantai. Pasti bakal balik lagi kalau ada kesempatan!"
"183.","Giles Waterworth","32","2024-12-31","1","Not a good experience, not sure it is even a 3 star nevermind 5, that is extremely far fetched. Very dated and run down, maybe was ok 20 years ago. Breakfast was ok. Location on beach is good. Service is lacking and have private events that take over the hotel and restrict the guests access. Seem to be more interesting in hosting events. Very poor. Surprised to see a few good reviews but these maybe from people coming for events"
"184.","Jenny Traveller","246","2024-12-31","5","First time at a resort and I have not been disappointed. This place is huge with beautiful gardens, two restaurants, two pools, a gym and heaps more, right on Sanur Beach. My room was booked incorrectly and they immediately found me the right room. This place suits all sorts, from retired people, singles plus families. Come and check it out for yourself 👌💖"
"185.","Momoko J","363","2023-12-31","5","Revisited in October 2023. This was our fourth stay. The pool and beach were as wonderful as ever. It was hard to pull the kids out of the kiddie pool. Breakfast Danish and croissants were as good as ever. I was happy to see the addition of a corner where you can make your own local food. The staff was as friendly and nice as before. The room was cleaned daily and neatly. It is true that the shower drainage is not great and the towels are old. But I have nothing to complain about when you can stay at a resort hotel with a beautiful Balinese garden in front of a beautiful ocean for this price. Oh, I forgot to mention that there are many restaurants, massage parlors, souvenir shops, and supermarkets nearby. In summary, the hotel was excellent as always. I recommend it especially for families. ーーーーーーー My favorite hotel in Sanur."

Saya juga bisa, kalau cuma mengidentifikasi lantai gak perlu saya minta diarahkan. 2. Londry mesti telepon kalau mau masukin laundry, kertas checklist dan kantong londry gak di refill. 3. Posisi aminities gak dirapikan, remote tv ntah dimana, handuk tetap aja di kursi. 4. Sabun gak di refill. 5. Sampah. Bekas shampoo gak dibuang. Tolong ya ini hotel bintang 5 tapi kok mesti semua dikasi tau baru diberesin. Gak malu sama hotel-hotel lain."

"191.","Luke Gennoe","23","2024-12-31","3","Starting to get a bit tired this old girl, buffet was cold every day. Rooms were very small. Booked for 5 people and only given 4 beds, they tried to charge us for an extra bed. Staff were very good though over all. Kids slides very run down and to shallow."
"192.","Josephine Effendy","19","2023-12-31","4","The plus point of this hotel is that it has direct access to the Sanur beach and I should add that the beach is beautiful. The sky is blue, clean sand, gorgeous sea waves and you can play watersports here too (the price is expensive though). They have a lot of pools too, kid-friendly ones with slides and adult pool with the bar. There are bicycles available for rent too and it's dog-friendly for walking. You can see the sun rise in the beach at around 6 AM and it's really pretty. However, the hotel is quite old, room cleanliness is quite bad but not extremely bad, breakfast is so-so. The service is good though and yeah overall I still loved it because the beach was amazing!"
"193.","Zainal Arifin","229","2024-12-31","5","I was coming for business agenda in Bali. It was so amazing stay. I like their spacious classic room, garden, and the private beach. I was lucky getting the Kecak dance performance at their Bamboo Restaurant. The must eat dish gor me is urap. I do like it! I got so nice direct sunrise and also beautiful indirect sunset. Sitting and enjoying the beach really released out the stress!! Hoping to get there again with my family!"
"194.","Natl","94","2023-12-31","5","Great hotel for the price. Good sized pool areas, decent breakfast, friendly staff, brilliant location, large rooms and lots to do and eat/drink in the area. After a couple of weeks staying in different parts of Bali it was great to have the beachside walkway to stroll along. It's hard to walk in most spots on the island and having this, and all the great bars and restaurants along the way, made a big difference. The ocean breeze is also great on a hot day. It's not really a 5 star hotel though. If you want luxury there are other options in the area but they will cost x5 more. I'd say this is more realistically a solid 4 star experience. The only downside for me is that it's almost impossible to find a lounger by the main pool during the day. But there was plenty of space on the beach."
"195.","AME","8","2025-01-31","2","We just arrived from Novotel, Lombok where everything was exceptional from decor to service. At Prama Sanur we booked the depressing Superior Suite: it provides the basics in an unloved small space. Chipped paint, old and lumpy mattress and clean but overused bedding- for the first time in my traveling life I looked for bed bugs, I was that uncertain; warm, not hot, water; functional but more depressive than impressive environment. Never again given the options in Bali."
"196.","Mia Utami","14","2025-08-31","5","Staffnya ramah, cepat dan sangat membantu. Kids friendly. Makanannya enak. Anak aku suka nginep disana. Agak menyesal tidak milih stay diprama aja sepanjang liburan di bali. Next trip akan kembali lagi"

"198.","cindy","72","2023-12-31","4","I stayed for two days and one night because there was a work meeting at Prama Hotel. The hotel is nice, but it has a bit of an 80s hotel vibe and feels somewhat old, although it’s quite charming. It really feels like you’re traveling back in time when you stay here, which is cool. But the room has few sockets 🥹 As for lunch, and dinner, honestly, I’d rate them 2/5 personally. The taste leans towards a more Western style, so it’s not quite suitable for locals, but that’s not a big issue. I prefer their breakfast 👍🏻 The best part is that the hotel has direct access to Sanur Beach, and the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. I really liked it, they were very responsive 😍👍🏻"

The staff are incredible. Everyone smiles and says hello. Breakfast has absolutely everything you would want and more. The Bamboo beach bar has a really nice daily vibe. The warmth and service is first class. The two pools were large enough for the number of guests and you can swim from the beach at the hotel.

Masih banyak ditemui tupai yang bermain di pepohonannya. Kolam renang nya ada 2, satu yang lebih banyak di gunakan oleh family dg seluncurannya dan tempat menunggu nya berupa bale2 yg nyaman, satu lagi mungkin lebih untuk dewasa karena tanpa seluncuran.

Every evening there is some entertainment offered, either in the resort or on a stage at the beach.

"233.","Sand G","73","2024-12-31","3","Very reasonably priced for a beach front hotel. Very spacious. Full of seniors, less young ppl. Zero night life obviously. by 9pm sanur is dead. Few things I observed: Fitness dumbbells Need to to be labelled. No idea of the weights in Kg. very dangerous for old folks. But also the whole gym equipment needs upgrading. Very outdated. Add more treadmills get rid of the other cardio machines that nobody touches. TV in the room was blurry, couldn't watch any channels. Hotel Needs to fix this with the Cable provider . Room is dusty and old, also quite dark, (need brighter lights). bathroom dirty. Toilet easily Clogged. Engineering took ages to come . Also, the shower in standard room is small, so if you are a tall and big person, it'll be tight (book a bigger room). and there is no glass door for the shower for some reason, so the floors get very wet. The housekeeping Needs to work harder at cleanliness. Also the balcony is full of birdpoop and insects. I saw A cat jumped on the table and ate the buffet at Bima stage. Had i not screamed the food wud hav been contaminated. coz no one noticed until i shouted. Breakfast is quite nice, complete selection of basic stuff, jus dont expect more than that. though watch out for FLIES, its outdoors after all. I would giv better grades if they work on my feedbacks."
"234.","Yohanes Sugiarto","135","2023-12-31","4","I stayed at Prama Sanur Beach Hotel several times and the service was consistently pleasant. Room rate for Superior (I think the smallest room) was reasonable. Huge hotel area with great access to Sanur beach. The hotel is facing east (Sunrise). Hotel look is very classic with Balinese style. The bed was comfortable, thick pillow, and effective air cond to handle Bali heat. Breakfast menu was plenty of choices (Bread, sausages, ham, salad, rice, noodle, eggs, etc.)."
"235.","Frankblue","193","2022-12-31","3","This hotel has already left best years behind. In many places it becomes clear that a renovation from the ground up is manageable. Unfortunately, the service has also left the hotel, there is a simple basic mood in the service concept. The hotel is no longer a five star hotel in any respect, nor would I want to classify it as a four star hotel. The reception and the farewell at the front desk left a lot to be desired. chasing a free table in the breakfast area and coffee in the morning was also a challenge. Was here for a few days, unfortunately the breakfast wasn't particularly good, at best average. The environment is excellent, cleaning within walking distance as well as numerous shopping facilities. I recommend you the Baby Monkey as a place to eat. The WiFi in the hotel was good. Unfortunately, the club rooms no longer have their own area for breakfast, which used to be much better."
"236.","Joel Cooper","239","2022-12-31","5","This place is pretty good for 35 USD per night with buffet breakfast included. I love how kids stay in the kid pool and don't come to the relatively empty adult pool. The beach bar with the swinging bar seats is fun. You can sit in beach chairs right there on the beach or walk down the beach walk to nearby hotels and restaurants. The place is old, but the rooms were not uncomfortable. They were quietly renovating while we were there. The buffet breakfast is huge. The hotel is within walking distance from a lot of great spas and restaurants, including a terrific brewery. The only negative is that it was pretty windy while we were there. This was my favorite place we stayed."

"242.","Aras Lumendita","22","2023-12-31","5","On the second day of our stay, we encountered an issue with unpleasant odors emanating from the plumbing in our room. While it was quite bothersome, I was able to mitigate the problem by simply closing the drainage, though I understand that this may be inconvenient for other guests. It seems that this is a common issue in the coastal areas of Bali, and considering the age of the hotel, we can sympathize with the problem. After all, we are connoisseurs of old hotels for several personal reasons. Nevertheless, we hope that the management can take measures to rectify this issue, as we would love to return and stay for longer than just two days. On other aspects, in short, all the 5-star reviews from other guests are honest and accurate. The entire staff is highly competent and professional, and the facilities we enjoyed were simply amazing. Spending a full day indulging in any of the hotel's amenities is well worth it. We were even pleasantly surprised by Ms. Ayu Agung, one of the marketing staff, who approached us during a delicious breakfast to offer birthday greetings. These positive experiences were a first for us and we highly recommend this place to others. It's saddening to leave this wonderful place, and we hope to return soon."
"243.","Olivia Monk","7","2023-12-31","4","Great location. Unfortunately due to the large size the service is not as friendly and as accommodating as we experienced elsewhere. Rooms are a little outdated but comfy enough. Large buffet breakfast. 2 large swimming areas and 1 suitable for kids with water park."

"245.","Tess D","207","2023-12-31","5","First time visiting Bali and I booked this hotel because of great reviews. I wasn't disappointed at all. We decided to extend our stay to another week. The hotel offers breakfast with a fee which is all worth it. There are lots of restaurants nearby, ATM and money exchange place. There's grocery store, laundromat, souvenir shops, motorcycle rentals which are all within walking distance."
"246.","Kwis TN","121","2025-05-01","3","Currently staying here. It's old, it's huge and it's right on the beach. It's also full of kids and local indo's as they get a cheaper rate than the tourists. Breakfast is out of food alot and is complete chaos It's just ok staying here, not a very classy place, in need of a lot of maintenance"
"247.","Karan Kariappa","1","2024-12-31","5","I recently had the privilege of spending time at the enchanting Prama Sanur Beach Hotel. Also shooting our tv show in that area. Let me start by saying that the beauty of Prama Sanur Beach Hotel is simply breathtaking. But what truly made my stay special was the people. I can't say enough about, the Marketing Chief at Prama Sanur Beach Hotel. From the first moment we met, she welcomed us with open arms and a smile that could light up the room. Her genuine warmth and kindness made me feel like I was reconnecting with an old friend rather than meeting someone for the first time. Miss Mas and the team went above and beyond to ensure that every aspect of our stay was perfect, and their passion for hospitality was truly inspiring. And then there are the little touches that made all the difference. Whether it was the friendly greetings from the staff, the thoughtful gestures left in our room, or the delicious meals served with a side of genuine care and attention, every moment felt like a warm embrace. In the end, my stay at Prama Sanur Beach Hotel was more than just a work, it was a soul-nourishing experience that left me feeling refreshed, rejuvenated, and grateful for the beauty of human connection. To Miss Agung Mas and everyone at Prama Sanur Beach Hotel, thank you from the bottom of my heart for creating memories that will stay with me forever."
"248.","nicole Giachin","39","2023-12-31","3","Excellent location but rooms are dated and many things need fixing when you look closely. Great family hotel with excellent pool with water slides for kids, as well as an adults only pool. Staff are excellent but not knowledgeable... many quite basic questions unanswered. Had a bad checking-in experience and had to wait hours. The area around the hotel along the beach is fantastic... so many great places to eat, so don't feel that you have to dine within the hotel. Not as chaotic as kuta side, not as pricey as nusa dua ... a great middle ground! If this place renovated it would get 5 stars from me, so only 3 for now."

"251.","frey cee","64","2024-12-31","4","Definitely not a 5 star hotel, so don't come expecting this. Rooms and hotel are very dated but clean. Staff are super helpful and we had a lovely stay, the location can't be beaten, pool facilities are great and the value for money is really good."

"253.","Peter Rosvall","40","2023-12-31","5","March 2018 Very nice and pleasant hotel with lovely meals. Located almost by the beach with a large, lovely pool. However, the tide took away some of the charm down on the beach. The best time was still on Gili Air which we were on for 3 days"
"254.","Jacquelyn Nathan","45","2024-12-31","1","The entrance is grand and then you go into your room and it's dirty and outdated. Pillows have saliva stains from the thousands of people that previously used them, our fridge was dirty, reception staff were not that welcoming probably because it's such a busy place. The wasps like to eat breakfast with you. The beach is ok, bit dirty with rubbish. 👎🏼We wouldn't recommend👎🏼 On the up side, close to restaurants and shops."
"255.","Hitesh Mehta","155","2021-12-31","5","Nice hotel with an old vintage touch. Very well kept, rooms are spotlessly clean. Beds are very comfortable for a good night's rest. The property is quite extensive and also includes a private beach area just for the hotel, there is also a cafe shop just on the beach owned by the hotel. All facilities are very well kept and maintained. The staff are friendly and very courteous. A must stay place if your in Sanur."
"256.","Geoff Stokes","59","2024-12-31","5","Good value for money hotel with a great beach bar, the Bamboo Bar... Happy hour 2 for 1 from 4 - 6 pm daily is a winner. Great spot right on the beach. I come here often and it's always good value. 👌"
"257.","Alexander C. Chandra","555","2024-12-31","4","Recently went back to stay at the hotel over new year celebration... generally okay...but for supposedly 5 star hotel, a lot can be improved. Stayed in one of those club room, light was so dim....asked for extra lamps, but the request was never addressed. Cleaning can also be improved. Attended their new year celebration reception, but they were confused with seating arrangements, and was slow to take and deliver our orders. Having said these, general stay was okay...staffs were friendly. Also ate in the three restaurants they operate, they are generally fine. The Indonesian one, or Lada , offers good Indonesian and Balinese options. Italian one was also good."
"258.","Garry Robert Mondale","272","2023-12-31","5","Saya menginap dan menambah extra bed (Rp. 350.000/extrabed). Dibantu staf bernama pak Arya, ternyata kamar saya di upgrade karena menurut dia kamar yg saya pesan terlalu sempit kl ditambah extrabed. + Ada private beach + kolam renang air hangat + semua staff ramah, kecuali staff yg bertugas di pool + sarapan variatif dan sangat lengkap - saya menginap di gedung baru (Room 731) tetapi saya merasa di daerah luar kamar seperti bau pesing ketika melewati daerah tersebut. Tp, bukan masalah penting."
"259.","Kim Glen","158","2023-12-31","2","Disappointing for the price. The rooms are tired and worn out. Bathroom is tiny and broken down, old fixtures. My room phone didn’t work and I couldn’t get wifi because the front desk woman who checked me in gave me the wrong instructions. There isn’t much soundproofing so other rooms slamming their doors when they come and go is very loud. Otherwise, the staff is very friendly and my bed was comfortable. The property itself is pretty and location is great, though they are doing construction on the pool right now so the pool is NOT a relaxing place and it goes on all day (no warning of this when you check in). Breakfast the next day is a grand buffet which was just ok to me. I would not stay here again. Sagara suites is very close and a much better experience and better breakfast!!."
"260.","Juniarti Rahayu","180","2023-12-31","5","Datang ke tempat ini dalam rangka belajar sekaligus healing keluarga. Tempat berada di pinggir pantai persis. Lokasi mudah ditemukan, cukup terkenal. Banyak pilihan kamar. Tersedia juga berbagai pilihan ruangan pertemuan. Taman luas, kolam renang pun ada berbagai pilihan untuk anak2 dengan arena bermain dan dewasa dengan kedalaman yang disesuaikan kebutuhan masing2. Punya pantai tersendiri di pesisir pantai Sanur ini dan bisa diakses oleh banyak orang tanpa harus membeli tiket. Resto atau tempat makan punya banyak pilihan ya. Pemandangan oke, bisa lihat sunrise di Pantai Sanur, ada taman didalam lokasi hotel maupun pinggir pantai. Dilewati Pedestrian sepanjang pantai Sanur ya, jadi kalau mau mampir bisa banget, for free, kecuali kalau mau makan di kafe/resto pinggir pantainya 😀. Makanannya juga enak2, banyak pilihan, disesuaikan dengan selera mau nusantara maupun mancanegara dan juga sesuai isi kantong. Layanan kamar cepat, bersih, cukup luas. Karyawan ramah, informatif dan sangat membantu. Tersedia mushala bersih yang ukurannya lumayan bisa menampung jamaah utk shalat jumat, bisa diakses oleh warga/pengunjung sekitar, dengan toilet bersih dan air yang cukup melimpah."
"261.","gijstheunissen","9","2024-12-31","1","Terrible outdated rooms. I was there 1 night and did not sleep. Airco did not work properly, room was smelling and not clean. Sheets and pillows were not comfortable and damp. Only the restaurant is good. This hotel needs a quick makeover."
"262.","Meg Rawson","44","2024-12-31","5","first time in a resort, and i LOVED it best thing? BUFFET BREKKIE so much variety and right on the beach! calm place not a crazy amount of tourists, much nicer place to stay than kuta or saminyak while still being close enough to enjoy those places too, rooms cleaned everyday and aircon perfect"
"263.","Tasmeyah Dawjee","39","2023-12-31","3","It's on the beach. The location and staff are wonderful but the hotel really needs better maintenence and repair. It's quite old, the towels have a damp smell and the marble etc are clearly discoloured. Didn't enjoy the breakfast either, there's flies everywhere and the taste isn't that of 5 star quality. But you get what you paid for, I guess."
"264.","prosario","47","2025-05-01","5","Stayed here for a full week. Great location, nice and clean room, tasty dishes, helpful staff, and heavenly beach/pool bar!"
"265.","Cat McDonald","223","2022-12-31","3","Right on the beach with a great beach bar and restaurant. Our least favourite of 4 hotel stays. Staff could be more helpful and hotel, including rooms in desperate need of refurbishment, very dated and tired. As we had to catch a boat early, we asked reception for an early continental breakfast in room. He rudely just uttered room service. Back in the room the phone didn't work and there were no breakfast option on the room service menu. This could be an amazing resort with a bit of upgrading and customer service. The check out staff were much friendlier and helpful."
"266.","Suharwana Syarif","24","2023-12-31","5","Kamarnya nggak kedap suara.. jadi suara tetangga tuh kalau berisik kedengaran.. but overall nyaman kok.. Fasilitas lengkap.. ad swimming pool, gym, resto n cafe... mau nyantai di pinggir pantai juga ad sundeck nya.."
"267.","Zulfan Zazuli","83","2023-12-31","4","Hotel with great facilities for family (seaside hotel with 2 pools) connected with approx 5 km jogging track at Sanur beach. The room was rather old but still nice. I guess the air conditioner in my room is not so good. The resto for breakfast was comy but not so many choices there."
"268.","Eka Satriawibawa","310","2024-12-31","5","Pertamakali menginap di hotel ini. Pelayanan sangat baik, tempat bersih. Ada 2 kolam renang untuk dewasa dan anak-anak. Kamar dengan interior yang baik, tapi langit-langit nya agak pendek. Mungkin karena hotel yang sudah lama berdiri. Pantai sangat dekat dengan kolam renang dan tidak perlu berjalan jauh. Makan pagi nya lumayan beragam, namun lebih ditambah variasi buah dan sayur untuk salad nya"
"269.","jonathan antonius","184","2024-12-31","4","Kamar agak kuno, ada suara seperti jerry mondar mandir di plafon kamar. Agak lembab karena dekat pantai. Pantai bersih dan bisa buat main anak. Kolam anak besar dan seru. Makanan sarapan variatif."
"270.","Dante Mahendra","10","2022-12-31","4","Staff yang ramah dan sangat membantu. Pantai yang rindang. Breakfast agak kurang. Selain kurang variatif kualitasnya juga harus ditingkatkan. Hotel yang sudah cukup tua tetapi masih tetap nyaman dan beberapa hal harus diperbaiki. Sebagai hotel berbintang disarankan untuk meningkatkan fasilitas yang tidak berbayar seperti lapangan tenis dan bersepeda. Kembali menginap lagi di hotel ini, why not?"
"271.","Corina Cohen","3","2024-12-31","5","My stay in Parma Sanur was amazing. The hotel is very beautiful and conveniently located right besides de beach. You feel you are completely isolated from everything and everyone, but when you leave the premises you realize you have a small city centre full of restaurants and stores, which is great. Breakfast is very complete and delicious. I would definitely stay here again."
"272.","Lawrence Leung","80","2024-12-31","4","If you can get it at around 60-65k a night it's not bad. Right on the beach. Decent pool, decent gym. Room is OK. Balcony OK. Big buffet breakfast is very good, probably one of the best breakfasts for hotels in this price range. But, coffee is terrible. Location and loungers right on the beach is what you're paying for."
"273.","Irfan Tebe","533","2023-12-31","5","Hotel yang terletak di area Sanur ini merupakan hotel lama namun terawat dengan apik sehingga nyaman untuk dijadikan akomodasi selama di Bali. Hotel tertata dengan baik dengan fasilitas yang sangat banyak sehingga cocok untuk mereka yang datang bersama keluarga maupun bagi pasangan. Lokasi yang jauh dari hingar bingar namun tetap dapat menikmati hiburan yang disuguhkan pengelola hotel menambah kenyamanan selama tinggal. Rekomen banget"
"274.","Dennis Daar","397","2024-12-31","4","If you get it for cheap like i did it’s a good deal.The rooms are old but i saw they are being painted and maybe also renovated.Mostly of the staff is friendly,the location is great,the facilities are ok but also need some renovation/work.Breakfast was good"
"275.","Jim Gow","174","2023-12-31","3","The hotel is somewhat dated and in need of refurbishment. Its certainly not 5 star, and would even push to reach 4 star. Located in a good position on the beach. The buffet breakfast is adequate, the staff are amazing."
"276.","Verathemusic","9","2023-12-31","3","Was staying fro 3 nights. The hotel is huge, and the garden is nice and well maintained. It has the access for private beach, but the beach was not clean and very well maintained. Breakfast was so so, and the lady at the first omelette station, the nearest to the buffet station mostly showed me sour face, and much nicer to the foreigners. Room was smelly and not so clean on the first day, fridge and AC also super noisy, because I guess they are quite old already, and the alley was quite creepy at night, since they gave me a room exactly in the end of the alley. The the door access that people passed was exactly in the front of my door, and I can heard it squeaking everytime someone was passing it at anytime. The top of the bed was also dusty, but as I requested they wipe it clean and vacuum it on the 2nd night, and yes, much cleaner on the 3rd night. I can understand that this huge hotel must be struggling during pandemic, yet they need to be well maintained to be in shape. But I feel very uncomfortable with how the staffs treat the local guests, including me. This hotel staffs are mostly not greeting whenever I passed them, not smiling, and also not so friendly to be asked for coffee in breakfast place, or to simply take my things from the concierge. Nobody offers me help with the luggage as well, except the bellboy that was on duty the night I checked in, on 14th of May. Through my stay, I could see the staffs are much friendlier and nicer to the foreigners guests. The lady in the omelette station also gave me sour face on the 1st morning staying there, and rudely told me to queue as if I didn't understand to queue - while I was indeed queueing, but there was no Q sign, so I just stand near the station. And I just left the station afterwards and I didn't take any eggs nor eat from the breakfast place on that day. Luckily for the next day I had breakfast meeting in other real 5 stars hotel that was much nicer. If you are having vacation as a family, and foreigners, this might be a good deal place to stay. But if you are on solo trip, not really on holiday, and local tourist, not really recommended."
"277.","johannes Lutgens","17","2023-12-31","1","Ask for new room because it was very dirty. Second room also was very dirty. Had them change the beds 3 times both of beds. Still you find large pee stain and yellow pillows that werent washed for years. All other hotels I was in Bali were much better. While talking respectively and with patience to the hotel manager I was being interrupted over 7 times. He was not listening nor caring. We were with group of TUI and all people were not happy with their room. They even offered a deep cleaning servers of the room. To even having to offer this is very questionable in a 4 star hotel. They did not offer refund nor any alternative solution. So we had to book another hotel."
"278.","James Wernicke Sr.","1427","2023-12-31","4","What a great hotel for families. It is ideal for kids with a large kiddie pool and extensive seating for Mom and Dad. The pool has a huge play area for the kids and the beach is shallow way out. Kids can use small pedal carts and the staff really looks out for the little ones when the parents aren't paying attention. Great buffet breakfast and there is a gym and adult pool. The hotel was showing it's age and could use a facelift vs the repair jobs. The drinks were very weak...like I noted this was more of a family resort not for couples although still nice enough. Sanur Beach was pleasant and there was an abundance of shops nearby. A Seaview room is the way to go. They had a pool party on Sunday and Brazilian Barbeque on Saturday, both with live entertainment."
"279.","Eugene & Cika","32","2023-12-31","4","We stayed for one night at the Prama Sanur Beach Hotel. Breakfast was excellent, amazing pool and great location with a lovely beach.Friendly staff allowed us to stay at the pool after check out. We had to wait for our room to be ready when checking in and the room was a little dated. We will be back for sure."
"280.","Margaret Lysaght","1","2023-12-31","5","My husband and I stayed 30th July for 9 nights. I am disabled now but have stayed 3 times before when I could walk so I was nervous how we would cope. The experience was first class from Simon and his team around the pool who went to great lengths for my comfort and help me getting in the pool. All staff from room boys to room service, reception, hotel car driver are outstanding. Perfect location near supermarket also 7km level path for my mobility scooter so we could visit other cafes,bars etc. The disabled room we had was ok,although we had to hire a shower bench and over toilet seat. Stepping into the shower was difficult, maybe if this step was removed it would be much easier for disabled people. We will definitely return 😊"
"281.","Paul Hobbs","31","2023-12-31","2","First impressions were that the staff had no interest at Check-in which is very unusual for us as we have never experienced this over the 25 years we have been coming to Bali. Staff were more disengaged than we have ever seen (a few were great tho). Cleanliness was another surprise. Our Toilet still had splatters in the bowl so was obviously not cleaned properly from last occupants. I am surprised at the great reviews this hotel is getting. We have been travelling all over the island over the past 3 weeks and staying at varying accommodation. Unfortunately, this was the worst and we won’t be back. The last straw was the “transportation desk” not ordering us Blue Bird Taxis and trying to rip us off with his own service."
"282.","Dim Wiiid","274","2022-12-31","5","I don't know if it's because of the renovations or because of the Corona, but for the price I have nothing to say. The rooms were comfortable on the upper floors, and they have everything you need: pool, beach, gym. The attached cafe wasn't open yet, but it looked like it was starting to cater to vacationers. I would be happy to stay here again for this price🤞"
"283.","Kurnia Trisno Yudhonegoro","136","2023-12-31","4","This is an older style hotel that opens up to sanur beach itself. The rooms were well appointed and tastefully designed. I loved the bathroom implements. The breakfast spread was a bit underwhelming for domestic tourists, while for westerners, all the main staples were there, such as delicious coffee, fluffy omelette, various healthy foods, and run of the mill Balinese cuisines."
"284.","Samantha","110","2023-12-31","4","I’m not kidding when I say that everyone is so very nice, helpful, and kind. This hotel is an oldie, BUT their room facilities were still good. Since it’s located in the rather south side (if I’m not mistaken), you can easily take a walk along the Sanur coast and enjoy the sunrise!!! There are a lot of good and amazing restaurants and bars nearby!!!"
"285.","Bimo Satrio","183","2023-12-31","5","This affordable five-star hotel is conveniently situated next to Sanur Beach. One of the highlights for me was being able to enjoy breakfast right by the beach, followed by snorkeling to discover a variety of small fish, starfish, and crabs. To top off the morning, you can take a refreshing swim in the superb pool located next to the restaurant. The hotel is also surrounded by fantastic shops and restaurants, offering a complete experience for lunch, dinner, and souvenir shopping. I highly recommend staying at this hotel when you visit the Sanur Beach area."
"286.","Ulyma Octafiola","9","2024-12-31","5","I always stay here whenever I have vacation in Bali. It has all the complete facilities and rather a quiet place to stay while within walking distance you can have a look around and shop. It has a private beach so you dont have to go far to enjoy the scenery."

Staffnya baik dan ramah, cepet juga pelayanan nya kalo ada apa apa Jujur milih hotel ini karena bawa bayi, tp emg. Alhamdulillah bocil friendly, jalan di pantai sore sore belakang hotel terus ada playground dan juga kolam renangnya. Makanan hotel menurut saya B aja ya, dibanding hotel bintang 4/5 di Jakarta yg varian makanan lebih banyak. But so far so good. Saya enjoy 2 malamnya disini. Semoga kalo ada kesempatan ke Bali bisa nginep disini lagi ya. Terimakasih"

"290.","Anita Ng","17","2023-12-31","3","Nice location near the beach but hotel is quiet old, small room with balcony. The price is ok for stay one night before the flight. Quick check out. Only few problems: the floor just new painting so have strong smell, a small dirty in blanket, chiller no work."
"291.","Coconut Queen","134","2021-12-31","5","Fantastic beach front hotel with fabulous facilities. Lovely outdoor swimming pools and a great kids pool with slides. Watching the sunrise on the beach in the morning is incredible and finding starfish in the morning was a treat 😁 Watch out for sea urchins though!! A hotel fit for couples, solo travelers, families and business travellers. Would highly recommend booking"
"292.","Slamet PS","568","2023-12-31","5","Ini pengalaman pertama disini. Lingkungannya enak. Fasilitas oke, kolam renang banyak dengan fasiltas bermain anak.

"293.","Karel Wouters","85","2024-12-31","4","Rooms need to be updated, old style rooms like most older hotels at the beachside. What disappointed me most was the many hairs I found in the bathroom and that's something I hate. Staff excellent, breakfast great 👍"
"294.","Ben H","52","2019-12-31","5","Great value rooms and the pools are excellent. Kids pool has plenty of room and the main pool is just enormous, like swimming in a lake! Right on the beachfront this is at the quiet end of Sanur so plenty of ability for quiet relaxation. Only issue is the bar putting on music in the evenings which disturbs the peace. Convenient to good quality non-hotel restaurants both on the beach and on the main road."

Coffee can be improved during breakfast, at least for European taste it can be stronger. Seaside was great and shallow, great for kids and relax, we liked everything."

"298.","Kanika","55","2023-12-31","3","The resort was great along the beach with great swimming pools(kids pool was actually amazing with water slides). But the rooms were very compact. The bathroom was not upto the mark for a 5-star resort. Could have been better"
"299.","NC","15","2024-12-31","3","Room I stayed in was run down, stained, broken components, and moldy, especially near the AC unit. Staff was fairly helpful. Very nice location, both in front of hotel and on the beach"
"300.","johanes wisnubrata","24","2018-12-31","5","The staff hotel was friendly and the lobby looks vintage with brown colour domination. There's Sanur beach direct behind the hotel and shuttle to Hardy's (supermarket, souvenirs & street cafes). Superior room quite small, just enough only 3 adult & deluxe bigger. All room has balcony & make sure to request the sea view or garden not parking view. Breakfast was excellent for me. Many kinds and taste good. No regrets in this hotel"
"301.","Elizabeth Permatasari (Liz)","9","2022-12-31","5","A good friend of mine treated me a swim package at Prama. It has a kid pool and 1 big main pool. We really enjoyed the main one with nice and clean water. Not to mention the friendly waiter who made us feel at ease. Outdoor shower and changing rooms are available. If you live around Denpasar and love swimming, you should give it a try."
"302.","Michael Welsh","87","2023-12-31","3","Prior to Covid this hotel was excellent. Unfortunately they have spent no money on refurbishment and it looks very tired in places. That said , it is still in a beautiful location and has one of the nicest pools I have seen anywhere. Hopefully the management will see what a gem they have here and invest some much needed love into the old girl."
"303.","Matthew Brealey","79","2022-12-31","2","The hotel is very old and they need to replace the carpet and refurbish the rooms. The bathroom was pretty poor in that there was no bum gun/bidet function, which is obligatory in Indonesia, and the toilet paper was difficult to reach. Many of the electric sockets in the room did not work. It was a bad choice for us as the breakfast (ok only, not great), is not of interest, and the only reason you would stay here given the old, poor, small rooms, is the beach access and pool areas. We should have stayed elsewhere as we did not use or have any interest in these. If you want these facilities, you can stay here, but for us this was a bad choice, and we moved to another hotel for half the price with more modern rooms"
"304.","Michael Doemner","140","2022-12-31","5","We loved the pool and the beach area! The water slides are a little well used but our kids (6, 8, 10) had a fun day. The beach area had plenty of seating and easy to order food or drinks, well servicesf by the nearby bar/restaurant."
"305.","fitria nurbaidah","40","2024-12-31","5","The location is superb. They have may longchair that can help you to enjoy the beach peacefully. They have swimming pool for kids. Suitable for family vacatiob."
"306.","Mahmoud Elkhodr","17","2022-12-31","4","They were running a special, basic rooms going for $65 AUD. We booked one of the good rooms deluxe garden access I think it is called for $110. If you are on the budget, this is a good hotel. It has everything beach front, excellent kids pool with slides and shade, many seating areas and chaise lounge. Everything is accessible within walking distance. Overall, this has been a good stay. The deluxe garden room is spacious, has a couch that folds into a bed, great for kids. Now the issues: This is not a 5 star hotel. Expect more like 4 stars. Cleanliness and amenities are not up to 5 stars standard. Breakfast choices are poor...and you would expect to line up for at least 10 mins at the egg station. We asked the waiter for fresh juice and cappuccino only to be surprised that we were billed for that. These were inclusive in all 5 stars resorts we stayed in so far in Bali. Other little annoying things: got a cocktail during happy hour buy 1 get 1 free. Then got billed for two. When I asked why, the answer was because you shared the drink with your wife, you are not allowed to share. I was laughing! And pool close too ealry by 7. Overall, if this is on special it is value for money. Just don't expect 5 stars."
"307.","Mila Tejamaya","3","2021-12-31","5","I loved the stay! The hotel is clean, very well kept, and has so many spots to take pictures. Besides that, the staff is also very nice. Smiles are always on their faces and I have nothing short of the best to say about them. The view is also amazing as there is a beach right behind the hotel. I organized a conference (before covid-19) here and to no surprise everybody that attended loved their stay just as much as I did. If you are bringing kids, dont worry! There is a pool here that your kids would love because it has a slide that can keep them entertained. If you love dogs, you would also love it here because there are many cute dogs roaming around the beach near the hotel! In conclusion, staying here is an amazing choice that I made and I will definitely recommend it to those who want to go to Bali."

Kolamnya ada 2 lokasi, 1 untuk dewasa(cukup dalam) dan 1 untuk anak2: Mulai dari kolam dengan air semata kaki org dewasa, 30 cm dan 1,5 m. Juga ada perosotan.. Hotel ini juga memiliki pantai sendiri akses langsung dr hotel."

Tamu2 rata dr eropa yg mencari ketenangan, krn daerah sanur lebih tenang dan sepi dibanding kuta, seminyak, dll Breakfast was so-so."
"313.","Tom France","36","2022-12-31","4","We booked this place for price. It’s a place mainly for families. It is nice. Very helpful staff. (Dayu) there was construction work going on at the time and painting the out side. But the service from bamboo bar was spot on. You can happily sit by the pool all day if you want and not get pestered. Although there is a lady out the back who begs you to come into her shop during breakfast. SHE DOES NOT CONE INTO BREAKFAST. Just waits for you to smoke. But the breakfast buffet is second to none. The pool is very nice. Sometimes the kids think it’s there pool when they have there own. All in all it’s a good place."

"318.","N.D. Carpe","115","2019-12-31","2","The rooms are pretty basic for the number of stars this hotel receives. The rooms are small, the bathrooms are dingy, the air conditioning doesn't get the room to a comfortable temperature. The beds are not great, either. The one thing that stood out was the pool area. There is a pretty good kids area which is separate to the adults pool. That means I didn't have to make sure my kids weren't bothering anyone, which was great! The food was, okay. Not great and too expensive."
"319.","Putu Tonsen","869","2021-12-31","5","Very nice and luxury hotel. Situaed strategically in Sanur area. It is closed to the airport, Denpasar and also to most tourist attraction on South Bali. Hotel staff are nice, friendly and helpful. Really know how to provide good service to their customer. I like the restaurant. It has good atmosphere. The pool also well located. For me, it is a five-star hotel. Recommended!"
"320.","Russell Churchill","35","2023-12-31","4","It's a lovely place & things got sorted when things wasn't right hats off to the staff. Unfortunately the food is over price as the drinks are very much over price too. They like charging for things you didn't have as in G&T if you ask for a double Gin then you can get charged for two lots of tonic. So just keep a look out on the bar tab. Pizza not always cooked soft & soggy bass not good & fish and chips the fish not always cooked properly. So again check it before eating. Would I use this place again yes as now I know what I'm looking for, & there's plenty of restaurant near by so not a real problem."

"330.","Yudesh Soobrayan","17","2019-12-31","4","I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights to attend a wedding. The service and environment was good but could have been better suited to travellers from outside indonesia. I asked for a travel adapter because the plugs were all only suited for Indonesian plugs and they didn’t have one. Luckily my power bank was full. The fittings and furnishings are a bit dated but everything was spotlessly clean. I had old bathrooms but even though the bathroom was a bit old it was also exceptionally clean! The service staff were very pleasant and helpful. The facilities are great for families and the beach is nice and quiet. Sanur is a quiet area though and suited for older people or families wanting to chill out rather than party people."

Everything on my plate was well cooked BUT bland, even the sauce, and that takes some skill! The cappuccino was almost cold and more like a milk drink. Forgetting teaspoons meant I had to use my desert spoon to stir it (yes I asked for a teaspoon which never arrived) Saving grace the tirimisu was quite nice. With the prices charged you must improve your flavours."

"337.","Consuelo Dassisti","34","2023-12-31","4","Sanur is beautiful. The service and staff of Prama Sanur are great. Rooms are old, and the air-conditioning splits are really dirty. Rooms need renovations. Be careful, do not exchange money at the first laundry/scooter shop on the left, out of the resort ( Cekak rent scooter). They are really dishonest. We changed money twice there, and with a stupid hand game, they gave us less money. Count money and do not let the guy touch it again. Unfortunately, when people play this stupid game with tourists, they risk that tourists will never come back to Bali."

"344.","Hario Kurniadi","51","2019-12-31","5","Was there for the New Year’s Eve 2019. This is an old hotel but well managed. Like any other old hotel in Indonesia, this hotel is HUGE. Lush greenery almost everywhere. Very clean both inside and outside. Room is dominated with wood crafting. Comfortable bed also. Sanur beach is very famous for spotting sunrise, so early morning stroll along the beach can be quite a bit a breathtaking experience."
"345.","Archimedes Daely","48","2021-12-31","5","I went to this hotel for my best friend's wedding on May 2021. I am totally agree with some comment that the room needs improvement. Since this one is a quite old hotel, it was established in 1974 and renovated almost decade ago. But for me, this hotel offers the service and experience that new boutique hotel cannot provide. The staff and the seamless check-in experience, breakfast by the beach, and friendly and well educated staffs. I had one experience asked the waiter for ice cube, although they cannot provide but they are willing to fulfill the task. So they went extra miles and ask the other restaurant for no charge at all. I really appreciate the goodwill and the intention. Last, I think this hotel is not for everybody (duh). But if you are mature enough or having vacation with your kids, even having babymoon this one is for you. If you love to feel the wind breeze watching sunrise while having breakfast this hotel is good for you. Or even you have the urge to take your best pawfriend strolling around the beach then this hotel definitely for you. After all, once you have trip to Bali all you need the comfort, the experience and most of the time you spend time outside the hotel. Trust me, you won't even notice the minor thing if you really ENJOYED you stay in Bali. Thank you Prama Sanur, please keep up the good work."

Rooms are big, pretty okay. It has an attached beach. There are a few restaurants. The sun rise is pretty good from here. They have a bar facing the beach also. They have a playground for children as well. One of the nights we were there, there was an event and very noisy but the noise ends at 10 or 11. It becomes quite annoying. If you are coming with family, pretty okay and decent place to stay and chill."

I enjoyed the welcome drinks and breakfast by the beach. Not hotels fault, but there were jogging track construction in the area so the morning jog was not that pleasant In the old days this hotel might be considered 4 star but for now really need some fixing"

Oya duty manager malam sangat membantu saat tamu di atas kamar sy berisik di jam 23. Memang smp dikomplain keras beberapa kali utk membuat tamu ini stop menggeser2 perabot dan membubarkan tamu yg diterima oleh tamu tsb di jam tidur malam saat itu. Yah kami msh komplain lg keesokan malamnya krn tamu itu msh menggeser2 perabot di jam2 tidur malam. Dimana akhirnya stop dan tidak ada lagi bunyi2 di malam2 berikutnya Note : warung mina, bella dan Baby monkey resto hrs coba. Massimo gelato dan mknan italianya yg enak.

"359.","Stephen Foo","92","2018-12-31","4","A really nice hotel, very conveniently placed.in Sanur with easy access to the beach. The rooms are comfortable and have TV with a large range of channels. Breakfast is buffet style with lots of variety and a great omelette bar. It also has a really nice main pool which is wide great for swimming or just playing in. Most nights there was live music on the beach which was really nice with people chilling.out or dancing to the music. The beach also has access to the other restaurants along the beachfront, so you can eat in a number of places without needing to go via the town. The only thing I was a disappointed in was the Balinese night with a buffet and traditional dancing. In my opinion the food wasn't great and the dancing didn't go on long enough with.more time than necessary given to guest being invited up to try the dancing, more.package resort Spain than Bali I thought, but many ofbtve guests did join in so if you like to participate then consider this as a positive. Overall I thought the hotel was very good and In really enjoyed my stay."

"362.","Jasmin Knecht","11","2025-12-01","1","Room: The room looked clean, but that’s the only positive part. It was very dark with almost no proper lighting. There were mosquitoes inside, and the room had two air conditioners even though one couldn’t be turned off at all. Because of that, the room is freezing cold day and night. When I informed the reception, they simply said it’s “rainy season” and didn’t offer any real solution. They promised to spray the room for mosquitoes, but nobody ever came. A technician came for the air conditioner, didn’t understand the issue, pressed the power button twice, and left. Service: The staff are unfriendly, unhelpful, and barely speak English. I never felt welcome or taken seriously at any moment during my stay. Food & Drinks: The food is shockingly bad for a place that claims to be a 5-star resort. The pizza I ordered from their “pizza oven” tasted exactly like a cheap frozen pizza. Everything is overpriced, and they add 21% to every bill. The cocktails are tiny and not worth the money. Breakfast was even worse: the buffet items tasted old and stale, as if they were reused day after day. I even received an undercooked omelette, which likely caused my stomach issues. Pool & Water Quality: The pool does not feel properly maintained. It seems like they use far too many chemicals, and there were several things floating in the water. After going in once, my skin felt irritated. Even the shower water smells strongly of chlorine. Value for Money: This resort charges premium prices but delivers the quality of a budget place. It absolutely does not offer anything close to a 5-star experience. You’re better off staying at a cheaper hotel and getting more value for your money. Conclusion: I feel completely misled by this resort. For the price they charge, the experience is unacceptable. I cannot recommend this place to anyone"

Hotel meminta tambahan harga 400 ribuan padahal kamar sudah dibayar di Agoda atau membatalkan reservasi di Agoda, dan membayar kamar langsung ke hotel dengan special rate. Setelah komplain ke Agoda akhirnya diperkenankan untuk check in. Pihak reservasi tidak berani bicara langsung ke kami, tapi beraninya lewat staff front office. Akhirnya kami menghubungi pihak Agoda dan good job buat Agoda, yang akan menyelesaikan masalah dengan pihak hotel tanpa melibatkan customernya. Dimana semua bisnis pariwisata hancur karena Covid, dan mulai bangkit dari keterpurukan tapi Prama Sanur dengan arogan meremehkan customer domestic. Good job buat Agoda, 1 Star untuk Prama Sanur."

Ada kolam renang dewasa dan anak. Bisa sewa sepeda buat gowes di sekitaran hotel dan pantai yang nyambung hotel. Nice hospitality."

Kids pool area was great for the kids and adults too. Staff was friendly Cons: Unfortunately guests had the very rude habit of taking over the pool lounges with towels and belongs early in the morning, then disappear for hours leaving no spots the rest us. Very disrespectful. The hotel really should take action against such behaviour."

"379.","aime xoxo","58","2019-12-31","5","A very nice hotel. Worth the price. The staff are nice and very welcoming. The rooms are beautiful and clean. The hotel has two swimming pools. I tried the hotel's restaurant which is located on the beach and the food is tasty. It's an Italian restaurant. If you want to have more local taste, they have another restaurant in the hotel or you could just walk out of the hotel and find nearby local resto. The hotel is surrounded by lots of cafe, it also near the infamous Massimo Cafe. You only need to walk 8 minuets to get there. The beach here is, I think, the best in Sanur. The waves are not strong which make it a safe place for your kids to swim. They also provide surf school and water sports activities. At night they provide entertainment in the beach bar."
"380.","Vinoth raj K","43","2023-12-31","1","Overall the hotel is good.. But what is the use if you are not having sufficient AC in your room and if you and your family is not able to sleep the entire night. I am writing this review at 3 PM in night staying in the hotel. This is our first day, After checkin we have raised the complaint that our AC is not having sufficient cooling and manager is saying that there is an issue across many rooms and it cannot be rectified.. After raising the voice they have agreed to change the room which is having the AC comparatively ok than previous one but not sufficient to sleep. Entire night we are not able to sleep because of not having sufficient cooling and air"
"381.","Nasi Goreng","81","2022-12-31","4","Pertama kali menginap. Deg2an. Hotel tua. Nyempil pula. Ternyata diluar dugaan. Kami betah disini. Walau perabotnya jadul dan kamar yg remang2 (buat sy). Walau ga semua staf ramah. Ternyata kamar yg luas, sarapan yg variasi, landscape yg luas, kolam yg luas, lingkungan yg menyenangkan baik di area hotel maupun di luar hotel (banyak resto makanannya enak enak plus ga mahal). Semua itu membuat liburan 3 hr kami menyenangkan dan betah sehingga kami ingin datang kembali. Dan kami kembali memesan kamar utk 5hr di tgl 25 des nanti. Ga sabar ingin kembali. Sy rasa sy sangat suka lingkungan sanur. Walau pantainya krg cocok utk berenang atau bermain main air .. lbh cocok untuk nongkrong menikmati indahnya pemandangan laut."

Padahal tagihan sudah dibayarkan lunas. Sungguh tidak sopan menelepon di jam 10 malam. Aplg untuk menagih tagihan yg trnyta sudah dibayar. Apa customer service nya tidak pernah diajarkan tata krama? Lalu besok paginya saat saya memberikan bukti pembayaran tiba2 ada tagihan dari bamboo bar yg bahkan saya tidak pernah memesan. Lokasinya sih bagus krn langsung pantai.

Catatan saja, untuk pilihan menu breakfast yang terbatas, mungkin karena saat itu hotel sedang sepi pengunjung."
"392.","Ron","73","2023-12-31","5","If you look for beach front hotel then Prama hotel is the one. Located in the beach front of Sanur beach. The staffs are always smile and greet to all guests. The breakfast need to has more variant of menu each day. Because they only serve the same menu everyday, western and Indonesian common food such as bacon, fried rice, and fruits. Perhaps due to this hotel run by Aerowisata a subsidiary company of Garuda Indonesia business line. Yet, this hotel has good amenities and toiletries and it's affordable."

Despite all that, this hotel has spacious outdoor area, good for children and the beach is just one step from the hotel door. Hotel breakfast is standard, not many choices, scrambled egg was there, its seasoned quite well but not having glazy look texture 😅. Be careful for moslem traveller, they also serve pork ham fried, please read the sign."

It is a big complex, if you are looking for a cozy place, this is not for you. It is extremely cold in the lobby, have a spare jacket or sweather when you come to check in :) Bamboo beach bar is also very comfortable, nice pizza and not extremely expensive. As a comparison pizza margarita is 60k. They say they have a good spa, however it is really expensive, more than 600k, while other nice spas offer the same for 300k and on the street you can do it for 100k."

"407.","Sandra Marinas Cid","9","2017-12-31","3","+ Very nice, welcoming and friendly staff. Beautiful setting. Many restaurants to choose from. Nice pools. Family friendly. The room was big enough and clean. - They kept us waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes in the lobby because there had been some problem with our room and we couldn't check in. The shuttle service is over by 5 pm, so you are forced to get taxis or walk around 30 minutes. The wifi is TERRIBLE. The hotel offers many shows and activities, but at a high price. We wanted to see the Legong Dance but you can only see it while having dinner in one of their restaurants. They told us the price of the dinner (buffet) but forgot to mention this was without drinks, taxes or the 7% tip. Wouldn't recommend it to couples without kids, or friends visiting the island, as this is a family oriented resort."

"414.","Kevin Fitzgerald","9","2024-12-31","5","The hotel's prime location and captivating beauty are undeniable, although it would benefit from an upgrade, as the rooms appear tired. Recognizing the challenges Bali faced during Covid, I'm understanding, yet recommend considering renovations in the next couple of years. However, the standout feature of the hotel is its remarkable staff, who are consistently friendly and helpful across all departments. From reception to housekeeping, and from breakfast to pool services, everyone exudes a willingness to assist with a smile. My only minor inconvenience was the room's electrical setup, where turning off the lights also shuts off the TV, hindering bedtime viewing. Additionally, the ongoing issue of guests reserving pool beds with towels and then disappearing for the day is frustrating and affects others' enjoyment of the pool area. Despite these minor grievances, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and look forward to returning, eagerly recommending your hotel to our friends in Australia."

Bapaknya kurus, pakai kacamata. Yang terburuk adalah, ketika hendak bersantai di Pantai belakang hotel, ternyata bau sampah sepanjang hari.

"445.","Cindy Verrells","3","2026-01-13","1","Kami menginap dari tanggal 27/12/2025 hingga 02/01/2026. Stafnya ramah dan membantu. Prama Beach Resort bukanlah hotel bintang lima. Kamar-kamarnya sangat kuno dan tidak bersih. Kamar kami tidak diisi ulang dengan gelas bersih setiap hari, dll. Kolam renangnya kotor karena semua ubin di sekitar tepi bagian dalam kolam berwarna hijau. Area resor tidak terawat dan tampilan luar bangunan resor perlu diperbaiki dan dicat. Kami menghadiri Pesta Koktail wajib dan makan malam Gala Malam Tahun Baru dan pergi 15 menit setelah tiba. Musiknya sangat keras sehingga Anda tidak bisa berbicara satu sama lain. Makanan yang ditawarkan tampak oke, meskipun kami tidak tinggal untuk makan. Di pesta koktail, kami memperhatikan kebersihan gelas bekas sangat buruk. Gelas dibersihkan di bawah keran yang mengalir kemudian digunakan untuk minuman baru lainnya. Namun, ketika kami meninggalkan Makan Malam Gala, setelah 15 menit, kami pergi ke kafe/restoran resor untuk bertanya apakah kami bisa makan di sana. Saya menjelaskan pengalaman buruk kami di makan malam Gala dan pelayan serta manajer menemukan meja untuk kami dan menyediakan makanan yang indah untuk kami. Seperti yang disebutkan sebelumnya, stafnya ramah dan membantu, meskipun saya meminta pemilik resor untuk memperbarui kamar dan tampilan bangunan."
"446.","Joshi Gee","4","2025-10-20","1","Tempat ini memang sudah lama perlu direnovasi. Banyak yang rusak. Kamar belum siap untuk check-in pada waktu check-in. Dekorasinya sangat tua. Kamar mandi tidak dibersihkan dengan benar. Pemesanan kami penuh sesak dan terpaksa menjejalkan tempat tidur single ke dalam kamar kami yang kecil untuk menebus kesalahan pemesanan mereka. Happy hour berbeda-beda di setiap bar di hotel yang sama. Daftarnya bisa panjang sekali. Banyak sekali hal yang bisa diperbaiki dengan pengawasan yang lebih ketat. Tempat ini benar-benar sudah usang."
"447.","Genesis 57","78","2025-11-20","1","Satu-satunya hal positif: lokasinya. Selain itu, hotel ini lebih mirip hotel bintang 3 di Tunisia daripada hotel khas Bali. Area resepsionisnya menyerupai ruang tunggu stasiun kereta api, kamarnya terasa seperti era 80-an, kamar mandinya mengingatkan pada hotel bujet, dan yang terpenting, AC-nya hampir tidak dingin, meskipun sudah beberapa kali diminta ke resepsionis. Seluruh bangunannya memberikan kesan yang agak ketinggalan zaman."
"448.","Laury Hamers","15","2025-08-20","1","Dari pantai, kolam renang ini tampak nyaman untuk menghabiskan sore. Kenyataannya memang begitu. Kolam renangnya kurang terawat (baca: ada ubin yang terkelupas di bawah perosotan). Catnya berceceran di mana-mana. Anda harus membayar biaya masuk sebesar €125.000 per orang. Anda mungkin berharap bisa menikmati makanan di kolam renang, tetapi atas saran pengunjung lain, kami hanya berani memesan dari penggorengan. Gelas dan piring tidak diambil. Seharusnya Anda mendapatkan diskon 10% dari tagihan, tetapi Anda harus memintanya secara khusus. Dan beberapa makanan tidak termasuk dalam diskon ini. Singkatnya, mengecewakan."
"449.","Linda Leard","8","2025-10-20","1","Secara keseluruhan, harga kamarnya kurang sesuai, ditambah tip! Harga kamar sama dengan di Australia, tetapi Anda mendapatkan lebih banyak di Australia, termasuk air yang bisa diminum atau dimasukkan ke dalam ketel, susu, dan biskuit gratis. AC-nya macet di titik beku, kamarnya bau apek, jadi mereka memasang pemblokir udara parfum di ventilasi AC. Saya sekarang menemukan jamur/lumut di pintu kamar mandi, jadi mereka mengirim seseorang untuk membersihkannya. Tidak ada petunjuk Wi-Fi, tidak ada peta untuk menemukan jalan di sekitar resor. Lelah dan ingin makan malam, dan tidak ada air gratis saat makan - ya, Anda juga harus membayarnya. Jika Anda orang asing, Anda seperti berjalan di atas tanda $. Memesan sate di malam sate - 6 tusuk dengan satu sendok makan saus kacang dingin yang menggumpal - meminta lebih, dan porsi kedua panas, tanpa gumpalan, dan porsinya lebih banyak - harga sudah termasuk pajak dan layanan - mirip dengan di Australia, dan sekali lagi, kualitas di Australia jauh lebih baik, termasuk hal-hal sederhana seperti segelas air. Bepergian sendiri tapi harga kamar sudah termasuk sarapan untuk 2 orang & saya tidak bisa mendapatkan kredit untuk sarapan kedua atau menukarnya dengan kopi! Jelas, ini bukan akomodasi atau tujuan pilihan saya - jika memperhitungkan biaya tiket pesawat dan waktu perjalanan, liburan di pantai Australia sama murahnya atau lebih murah, lebih bernilai & berkualitas lebih baik 😉 Tapi tunggu dulu....masih ada lagi - ini remote controlnya - cuma jamur tua yang besar sekali!!! Saya tidak mengerti...sulit dipercaya ulasan 5/5 itu benar - cuma bilang saja..Saya punya foto tapi tidak bisa posting. Stafnya cantik, tentu saja, bukan salah mereka - saya yang bayar, mereka tidak menghasilkan uang - ada pihak ketiga yang menipu kita berdua!"
"450.","Jorgen en Sandra Jilleba","7","2025-06-20","1","Setelah tur Bali yang indah, tempat kami menginap di hotel-hotel yang terkadang sederhana namun indah, kami tiba di sini. Setibanya di sana, kamar kami belum siap, yang mungkin karena waktu itu pukul 14.45, dan check-in dimulai pukul 14.00. Kami ditawari minuman di salah satu restoran sambil menunggu. Karena kamar belum siap, dan kami berpikir, Mari beri mereka waktu tambahan, karena cukup ramai—seluruh lobi penuh dengan koper, kami pergi makan siang. Karena kami berada di restoran pizza, kami memesan dua pizza dan, setelah memakannya, suami saya langsung merasa mual. ​​Saat itu, sudah pukul 15.00, dan kami bertanya apakah kamar kami sudah siap, tetapi ternyata belum. Jadi kami pergi minum lagi. Pukul 16.00, kami pergi ke kamar. Saat masuk, baunya apek, cermin-cerminnya berembun, dan lantai serta tempat tidurnya basah, belum lagi noda di dinding dan cermin, sealant kotor di kamar mandi, dan sebagainya. Kami bahkan memutuskan tidak ingin tinggal di sana selama tiga malam."
"451.","Leanne Merton","10","2025-07-20","1","Hal terbaik dari tempat ini adalah lokasinya... tepat di pantai. Namun, kamarnya jauh di bawah standar! Kamarnya belum dibersihkan, di luar balkon kecil kami dipenuhi puntung rokok, menjijikkan, ventilasi AC hitam dan berdebu... Saya tidak akan merekomendasikan tempat ini karena alasan kesehatan. Sangat disayangkan karena saya pernah menginap di sini sebelumnya dan itu bagus."
"452.","Felix Goßner","2","2025-07-20","1","Stafnya sangat ramah dan membantu. Sayangnya, seluruh hotelnya sangat usang; baik kamar maupun area luarnya sudah lama tidak terawat! Saya tidak tahu bagaimana hotel ini bisa mempertahankan peringkat bintang 5-nya."
"453.","Peng Liu","139","2025-07-20","1","Areanya cukup luas dan lingkungannya cukup bagus. Namun, tempat ini terlalu tua. Lampu kamar mandi berkedip-kedip, pengering rambut di dinding rusak begitu digunakan, dan tercium bau terbakar. Selalu ada suara gemerisik di atap. Suara kulkas begitu keras sehingga bisa sekeras suara di luar..."
"454.","Rick","121","2025-12-20","1","Kolam renang anak-anak sudah rusak dan beberapa perosotan ditutup. Seluruh bangunannya perlu direnovasi."
"455.","Caspar Y","37","2025-07-20","1","Pengalaman saya menginap di hotel bintang lima ini baru-baru ini, selama konferensi penelitian internasional, sangat mengecewakan karena beberapa masalah. Kondisi Fasilitas Hotel ini tampak tua dan kurang perawatan dasar. Saya melihat kebocoran di lorong. Di kamar, pengering rambut tidak berfungsi, stopkontak di kamar mandi mati, dan semua stopkontak lainnya longgar. Kunci pengaman rusak, dan kulkas sangat berisik. Staf dan Organisasi Konferensi Staf secara umum kurang ramah dan tidak tersenyum, menunjukkan perlunya peningkatan pelatihan interaksi dengan tamu. Selama konferensi, rambu-rambu penunjuk arah tidak jelas dan tetap terpasang bahkan setelah acara selesai, menunjukkan kurangnya manajemen yang efisien dan tanggung jawab yang jelas. Sangat disarankan untuk menghindari hotel ini."
"456.","Ulrike Dominco","4","2025-04-20","1","Kami menginap di dua kamar. Keduanya kotor dan usang. Lemari pakaiannya penuh jamur. Staf housekeeping sudah berusaha keras, tetapi mereka benar-benar kekurangan staf. Lantainya tidak pernah dibersihkan. Area luar ruangan, kolam renang, dll., sangat bersih dan terawat. Kami tidak akan pernah mau menginap di hotel ini lagi."
"457.","Jantje Jantjek","3","2025-01-20","1","Saya baru-baru ini menginap di Prama Sanur Beach Hotel, dan sayangnya, sama sekali tidak menyenangkan. Harga yang mereka tetapkan untuk hotel ini benar-benar tidak sebanding dengan apa yang Anda dapatkan. Hotel ini sudah tua dan semuanya berbau jamur. Kasurnya sudah usang, robek, dan penuh noda, yang sungguh tidak higienis. Lebih lanjut, kebijakan pemesanan mereka sangat menyesatkan. Selama proses pemesanan, tipe kamar yang seharusnya umum menghilang, memaksa Anda memilih opsi yang lebih mahal. Misalnya, jika Anda bepergian dengan anak berusia 14 tahun, Anda terpaksa memesan dua kamar, bukan satu kamar dengan tiga tempat tidur. Ini terasa seperti strategi yang disengaja untuk memeras lebih banyak uang dari wisatawan. Praktik semacam ini tidak hanya tidak profesional tetapi juga merusak reputasi pulau wisata Bali yang indah. Prama Sanur Beach Hotel tampaknya lebih mementingkan keuntungan daripada memberikan pengalaman yang baik. Sangat mengecewakan dan jelas tidak direkomendasikan."
"458.","Baby Riedel","13","2025-01-20","1","Hotel ini sangat kuno dan kotor. Kamar saya perlu dibersihkan dan dirawat secara menyeluruh. Kolam renangnya sangat terbuka, tanpa pepohonan atau naungan. Anda bisa merasakan panas yang menjalar ke wajah Anda. Resor ini sangat besar dengan kamar-kamar kecil sehingga banyak orang dan sangat ramai saat sarapan, begitu banyak orang yang mengambil sarapan sendiri sehingga ada beberapa tamu yang kasar dan stres. Kualitas dan kebersihan sarapan dipertanyakan. Kulkas di kamar saya sangat berisik sehingga saya harus mematikannya. Seprainya bernoda. Saya bahkan tidak ingin membayangkan apa yang ada di balik seprai mengingat betapa kotornya semua yang lain. Klub anak-anak tidak menarik bagi anak saya yang berusia 4 dan 7 tahun dan kami langsung pergi. Taman air anak-anak kecil dan kuno. Jelas tidak sepadan dengan peringkatnya. Saya tidak akan merekomendasikan hotel ini."
"459.","Bel","5","2025-05-20","1","Mungkin ini hotel terburuk yang pernah saya tinggali. Benar-benar tidak sepadan dengan harga $130 per malam, seharusnya $20 per malam… ada jamur di dinding dan lantai kamar, dan kamar mandinya berjamur. AC-nya bau sekali, mungkin juga berjamur. Staf resepsionis sama sekali tidak membantu (bahkan tidak bisa memesankan taksi untuk kami ke bandara). Kolam renangnya sangat tua, tidak seperti di foto, dan perosotannya sama sekali tidak aman untuk anak kecil. Tidak akan pernah menginap di sini lagi. Lokasinya juga tidak terlalu dekat dengan pusat kota. Tidak tahu siapa yang memberi peringkat hotel ini, jadi sepertinya bintang 0."
"460.","Essy J","10","2025-04-20","1","Kami menginap di hotel selama 4 malam dan mendapatkan pengalaman yang sangat buruk. Kamar dan tempat tidurnya kotor, semuanya sudah tua, di mana-mana penuh dengan serangga mati. Saya rasa mereka tidak percaya pada kebersihan, dan saya tidak akan pernah kembali lagi. Kolam renang anak-anak lumayan, putri saya bersenang-senang, tetapi karena cuaca, kami tidak bisa berenang, jadi kami harus tetap di dalam ruangan. Saya merasa seperti bukan hotel, melainkan rumah pensiun. Baunya sangat busuk di mana-mana."
"461.","Young","14","2025-06-20","1","Lihat saja tempat tidur tambahannya, Anda bisa tahu betapa buruknya pengelolaannya di sini. Tempat tidurnya robek dan berjamur. AC-nya juga berjamur, dan kipas kamar mandinya tidak berfungsi. Saya sudah meminta mereka memperbaikinya tiga kali dalam dua hari, tetapi mereka tidak pernah datang. Ini adalah sarapan terburuk dan kamar terkotor yang pernah saya alami di Bali. Untuk harga segitu, lebih baik cari yang lain saja."
"462.","angeltavia","1","2025-06-20","1","Ponsel saya dicuri di sini, sepertinya karena petugas kebersihan. Staf mencoba membantu tetapi sama sekali tidak membantu dan hanya menyarankan saya untuk memeriksa iPhone saya, tanpa bertanya kepada petugas kebersihan. Saya berhadapan dengan petugas kebersihan dan mereka bersikap mencurigakan dan saling menyeringai. Harap berhati-hati dan gunakan brankas kamar di sini dan di mana pun :)"
"463.","mariska husada","7","2025-02-20","1","Bangunannya tampak tua namun terawat baik, tetapi pelayanannya mengecewakan. Saat check-in, kami meminta tempat tidur tambahan dan dijanjikan akan siap dalam 15 menit. Namun, setelah 1,5 jam, tempat tidur tersebut belum juga tiba. Ketika kami menghubungi operator, mereka hanya mengatakan akan menghubungi bagian tata graha dan meminta kami untuk menutup telepon. Selain itu, kami menanyakan tentang paket perawatan spa, tetapi operator hanya dapat mengarahkan kami ke departemen spa, yang tidak mengangkat telepon setelah tiga kali mencoba. Meskipun demikian, operator terus menghubungkan kami kembali ke spa. Kami kemudian menghubungi resepsionis, dan informasi yang diberikan operator tentang bukanya spa ternyata tidak benar—resepsionis memberi tahu kami bahwa spa tersebut sudah tutup. Keramahannya kurang, dan ada kebutuhan yang signifikan untuk peningkatan dalam pengetahuan produk dan kualitas layanan."
"464.","Erwin Tisseur","50","2025-01-20","1","Hotel tua dan kotor. Kami memesan tiga kamar mewah, tapi kami tidak yakin apa arti sebenarnya dari kata mewah. Hal pertama yang kami sadari saat masuk adalah bau busuknya. Sebagai penderita asma, saya menjelaskannya kepada mereka dan menjelaskan bahwa itu karena AC yang kotor. Kemudian dibersihkan, karena kamar lain juga berbau tidak sedap. Hotel ini sama sekali tidak ada hubungannya dengan Bali; hotel ini sudah tua dan perlu perawatan di mana-mana. Kompleksnya luas dengan semacam gubuk sarapan. Saya dan istri saya telah berada di Indonesia enam bulan setahun selama delapan tahun, tetapi kami belum pernah mengalami hotel seburuk itu. Di hari terakhir, kami menerima surat permintaan maaf karena malam itu ada pesta besar untuk rombongan dari luar kompleks, yang disertai dengan suara bising yang memekakkan telinga. Untungnya, kami hanya memesan untuk tiga hari. Mereka mematok harga untuk menginap bintang lima, tetapi itu bahkan tidak sepadan dengan bintangnya. Singkatnya, jika Anda ingin menjelajahi Bali, jangan menginap di sana."
"465.","jan van deijk","71","2025-06-20","1","Hotel ini sangat kotor, saya sudah mengunjungi beberapa hotel di Bali tetapi yang ini benar-benar kotor dan buruk, kamarnya tidak terlihat bagus dan kamar mandinya terlalu kotor untuk mandi, jamur dan rambut ada di mana-mana, tempat tidurnya terlalu kotor untuk tidur dan harganya sangat mahal."
"466.","Léa Bernard","3","2025-01-20","1","Hotel yang harus dihindari. Ketika kami tiba di hotel ini, kami terkejut dengan kebersihan kamar. Tidak ada pelindung kasur, ada rambut di seprai, ada noda di bantal dan handuk. Anda mungkin bertanya-tanya apakah kamar sudah dibersihkan sebelum kedatangan kami. Hotel menawarkan kamar kedua yang sama kotornya. Jadi, kami mendapat peningkatan kamar, tetapi lagi-lagi kamarnya tidak bersih. Mereka harus mengganti seprai sebelum kami masuk. Malam harinya, ketika kami makan di restoran dan ingin makan hidangan penutup, mereka tidak punya apa-apa. Cucian kami dicuci, dan betapa terkejutnya kami ketika mengetahui tagihan akhir sebesar €45! Sayang sekali menyebut diri kami bintang 5 untuk layanan yang diberikan. Selama perjalanan, kami menginap di hotel dengan bintang lebih sedikit, tetapi jauh lebih bersih daripada hotel ini. Kami sama sekali tidak merekomendasikan hotel ini dan sangat kecewa."
"467.","soizic Mondon","13","2025-05-20","1","Hotel ini jauh dari hotel bintang 5; sudah ketinggalan zaman, dan hanya halamannya yang terawat baik. Kebersihan kamar dan handuknya dipertanyakan, dan ada kecoak."
"468.","Giles Waterworth","32","2025-01-20","1","Pengalaman yang kurang memuaskan, saya tidak yakin ini bintang 3, apalagi bintang 5, itu terlalu mengada-ada. Sangat kuno dan kumuh, mungkin 20 tahun yang lalu masih oke. Sarapannya lumayan. Lokasinya di pantai bagus. Pelayanannya kurang dan ada acara pribadi yang mengambil alih hotel dan membatasi akses tamu. Sepertinya lebih menarik untuk menyelenggarakan acara. Sangat buruk. Saya terkejut melihat beberapa ulasan bagus, tetapi ini mungkin dari orang-orang yang datang untuk acara."
"469.","Christian Osman Rasmussen","2","2025-02-20","1","Prama mungkin dulunya hotel bintang 5, tapi sekarang tidak lagi! Tidak ada satu lantai pun yang ubinnya tidak direkatkan. Instalasi toiletnya setinggi merangkak. Kamar mandinya kotor dan kami sudah membersihkannya. Semua stopkontak dan sakelar on-off berminyak dan belum dibersihkan setidaknya selama 10 tahun. Jangan pindahkan furnitur karena di belakangnya ada instalasi listrik yang mencurigakan dan berjamur. Sangat menjijikkan, maafkan bahasa saya. Kami sudah memberi tahu pihak hotel. Saya sudah sering bepergian dan ini seperti Hotel Hyundai, Ulsan, Korea tahun 1991, hanya saja belum direnovasi sejak itu. Hotel Hyundai sudah direnovasi dan berperingkat 5 bintang. Peralatan untuk Hyundai untuk menggambar paralel. Kamar 806 dan tepat di luar. Tidak ada perubahan jika Anda berjalan lebih jauh 😱 Salam hangat, Tina dan Christian"

Semua bagian logam di kamar penuh karat, kamar mandi penuh jamur, furniturnya tua, dan seprai penuh noda kotor. Lingkungan hotel kumuh dan semuanya agak rusak. Satu-satunya hal positif adalah lokasi dan stafnya yang ramah, yang mengizinkan kami pindah hotel. Hotel ini membutuhkan renovasi dan renovasi besar-besaran."

Hanya satu stopkontak yang berfungsi saat lampu mati. Seprainya bernoda. Wi-Fi-nya bermasalah.

"473.","Andy Marzyk","3","2025-01-20","1","Hotel yang luar biasa. Pelayanannya luar biasa. Keramahan adalah prioritas utama di sini. Banyak hal yang bisa dilakukan, hanya 5 menit berjalan kaki dari keramaian. Sayangnya, pantainya buruk; hampir mustahil untuk masuk ke laut saat pasang surut. Airnya cukup tinggi di pagi hari, dan menjelang siang sudah tidak ada yang tersisa. Selain itu, pantainya tertutup rumput laut, jadi Anda tidak tahu apa yang Anda injak. Selebihnya, pantainya fantastis. 👻"
"474.","Caroline Lacroix","26","2024-01-20","1","Hindari hotel ini jika Anda mencari keaslian, kedamaian, dan ketenangan. Kamar-kamarnya tua dan kurang bersih, dengan noda di dinding, kursi, dan tirai. Kamar mandinya sangat kecil, tetapi perlengkapan tempat tidurnya memadai. Layanan kebersihannya minim. Makanannya relatif enak, dengan pilihan dua atau tiga restoran. Hotel ini menghadap laut, tetapi hati-hati, pantainya umum, jadi seringkali kotor. Sangat mengecewakan karena pantainya sama sekali tidak seperti pantai-pantai indah di kartu pos. Belum lagi banyaknya anjing liar yang terkadang terlihat di malam hari di kolam renang hotel. Dan ya, saya jamin, ini memang benar. Karena hotel ini buka di tepi laut, tanpa pengawasan atau keamanan apa pun, hotel ini menjadi pintu masuk bagi anjing-anjing liar ini, yang terkadang dalam kondisi buruk. Sungguh MENGECEWAKAN! Teman saya, yang fasih berbahasa Inggris, tidak ragu keesokan paginya untuk memberi tahu manajer resepsionis tentang semua ketidaknyamanan dan kemarahan kami ini. Sayangnya, kami tidak membawa kamera untuk membuktikannya kepada manajer, yang sangat terkejut mengetahui bahwa ada anjing yang berenang di kolam renang pada malam hari, yang membuktikan bahwa mereka tidak profesional. Poin positifnya, stafnya sangat ramah, terkadang agak lambat, tetapi sangat membantu. Hotel ini diberi peringkat bintang 5 di Bali, tetapi bahkan tidak sampai 3 bintang. Sangat mengecewakan."
"475.","Henk Bosch","17","2024-01-20","1","Beberapa tahun yang lalu, hotel ini cukup bagus. Namun, kamar-kamarnya (Deluxe Seaview) belum direnovasi selama 20 tahun. Kami menginap di kamar Deluxe Seaview, nomor 705. Perabotannya masih sama. Perabotan lama masih bisa diterima, tetapi dudukan toilet yang kotor (sudah diganti sepenuhnya setelah diminta dibersihkan), sakelar yang kotor, dan lemari dengan noda lengket dari minuman penghuni sebelumnya sungguh tidak bisa diterima. Kebersihannya pun sangat minim. Kualitas sarapannya masih sangat baik, dan stafnya masih sangat ramah. Singkatnya, kejayaan yang memudar."
"476.","Hetty Daals","8","2025-01-20","1","Kami sudah kembali beberapa kali, terakhir kali bulan Juli 2024. Kasurnya sangat kotor. Kasurnya penuh sobekan, dan ada lapisan pelindung tebal yang berlumuran noda darah. Bantalnya juga sangat kotor. Untungnya, saya membawa sarung bantal sendiri. Saya mengajukan keluhan tentang kasurnya, tetapi tidak ada tindakan apa pun. Hampir mustahil karena kami butuh kasur baru. Saya melihat kasur di kamar lain, dan ternyata juga penuh sobekan. Kamar mandinya juga sangat kotor, tetapi saya sudah mengantisipasinya dan membawa tisu pembersih. Wah, kamar mandinya benar-benar kotor setelah saya mengepel ubinnya. AC-nya sangat kotor. Pembersihan kamar hanya terdiri dari menyapu lantai dan menyediakan handuk bersih, tidak ada yang lain. Kami sudah kembali berkali-kali, tetapi keadaannya semakin memburuk. Saya ingin kembali lagi tahun 2025 atau 2026; saya benar-benar tidak yakin apakah kami harus memilih hotel ini lagi. Stafnya sangat ramah, dan sarapannya enak."

Bantalnya bernoda air liur dari ribuan orang yang pernah menggunakannya, kulkas kami kotor, dan staf resepsionisnya kurang ramah, mungkin karena tempatnya ramai. Tawon-tawon suka sarapan bersama. Pantainya lumayan, tapi agak kotor karena sampah. 👎🏼Kami tidak merekomendasikannya👎🏼 Sisi positifnya, dekat dengan restoran dan toko."

Seprai dan handuk—saya sudah mengunggah fotonya, tidak ada komentar di sini. Juga tidak ada yang bisa dimakan di pesta Tahun Baru, dan kami memesan minuman dua kali, tetapi tidak ada yang datang. Akhirnya kami meninggalkan pesta itu dan pergi ke restoran di luar hotel. Intinya, saya tidak akan merekomendasikan tempat ini kepada siapa pun."

Namun, Anda masih menemukan noda kencing yang besar dan bantal kuning yang tidak dicuci selama bertahun-tahun. Semua hotel lain yang pernah saya kunjungi di Bali jauh lebih baik. Saat berbicara dengan sopan dan sabar kepada manajer hotel, saya diganggu lebih dari 7 kali. Dia tidak mendengarkan atau peduli. Kami menginap bersama rombongan TUI dan semua orang tidak puas dengan kamar mereka. Mereka bahkan menawarkan layanan pembersihan kamar secara menyeluruh. Bahkan menawarkan layanan ini sangat dipertanyakan untuk hotel bintang 4. Mereka tidak menawarkan pengembalian uang atau solusi alternatif apa pun. Jadi kami harus memesan hotel lain."

Pukul 8 pagi, semua kursi berjemur sudah dipesan, dan pukul 11.30 pagi, masih kosong (pukul 1 siang, kursi-kursi itu masih kosong kecuali handuk). Tapi manajemen hotel tidak melakukan apa-apa. Mereka bilang sedang mencari solusi, tapi Anda hanya perlu melepas handuknya!!! Saya menemukan solusinya untuk Anda. Saya pernah menginap di hotel lain di Bali, termasuk Mercure, yang persis di sebelahnya, dan tidak ada masalah seperti ini. Dan di sore hari, para tamu minum bir sambil berenang: kemarin kolam renangnya penuh bir. 🤮Saya"
"483.","Jasmin Knecht","11","2025-12-20","1","Kamar: Kamarnya tampak bersih, tapi hanya itu sisi positifnya. Ruangan itu sangat gelap dan hampir tidak ada pencahayaan yang memadai. Ada banyak nyamuk di dalam, dan kamar itu memiliki dua AC meskipun salah satunya tidak bisa dimatikan sama sekali. Karena itu, kamarnya sangat dingin siang dan malam. Ketika saya memberi tahu resepsionis, mereka hanya mengatakan sedang musim hujan dan tidak menawarkan solusi nyata. Mereka berjanji untuk menyemprot kamar anti-nyamuk, tetapi tidak ada yang datang. Seorang teknisi datang untuk memperbaiki AC, tidak mengerti masalahnya, menekan tombol daya dua kali, lalu pergi. Layanan: Stafnya tidak ramah, tidak membantu, dan hampir tidak bisa berbahasa Inggris. Saya tidak pernah merasa diterima atau dianggap serius selama menginap. Makanan & Minuman: Makanannya sangat buruk untuk tempat yang mengaku sebagai resor bintang 5. Pizza yang saya pesan dari oven pizza mereka rasanya persis seperti pizza beku murah. Semuanya terlalu mahal, dan mereka menambahkan 21% ke setiap tagihan. Koktailnya kecil dan tidak sepadan dengan harganya. Sarapannya bahkan lebih buruk: hidangan prasmanan terasa lama dan basi, seolah-olah digunakan berulang kali setiap hari. Saya bahkan menerima omelet yang kurang matang, yang kemungkinan menyebabkan masalah perut. Kualitas Kolam Renang & Air: Kolam renang terasa tidak terawat dengan baik. Sepertinya mereka menggunakan terlalu banyak bahan kimia, dan ada beberapa benda yang mengapung di air. Setelah masuk sekali, kulit saya terasa iritasi. Bahkan air pancurannya berbau klorin yang menyengat. Nilai untuk Uang: Resor ini mengenakan harga premium tetapi memberikan kualitas tempat yang terjangkau. Resor ini sama sekali tidak menawarkan pengalaman bintang 5. Lebih baik Anda menginap di hotel yang lebih murah dan mendapatkan nilai lebih untuk uang Anda. Kesimpulan: Saya merasa benar-benar tertipu oleh resor ini. Untuk harga yang mereka tetapkan, pengalamannya tidak dapat diterima. Saya tidak dapat merekomendasikan tempat ini kepada siapa pun."
"484.","Vinoth raj K","43","2024-01-20","1","Secara keseluruhan hotelnya bagus.. Tapi apa gunanya kalau AC di kamar tidak memadai dan Anda dan keluarga tidak bisa tidur semalaman. Saya menulis ulasan ini pukul 15.00 saat menginap di hotel. Ini hari pertama kami menginap. Setelah check-in, kami mengeluh bahwa AC kami tidak cukup dingin dan manajer mengatakan ada masalah di banyak kamar dan tidak bisa diperbaiki. Setelah menjelaskan masalahnya, mereka setuju untuk pindah ke kamar lain yang AC-nya relatif lebih baik daripada sebelumnya, tetapi tidak cukup untuk tidur. Sepanjang malam kami tidak bisa tidur karena AC dan AC tidak cukup dingin."
"485.","Jinny","37","2025-01-20","1","Ini perjalanan kelima saya ke Bali, dan ini pengalaman hotel terburuk yang pernah saya alami. Saya tipe orang yang biasanya mengabaikan banyak hal, tapi wow... 1. Makanan pesan antar Ada makanan tersisa di depan pintu saya yang tidak saya makan. Siapa sih...? Saya pertama kali menelepon lobi dan meminta mereka untuk membersihkannya, dan mereka tidak melakukannya, jadi saya pergi ke lobi satu jam kemudian dan meminta mereka untuk membersihkannya. 5 jam kemudian, mereka masih belum membersihkannya, jadi saya kembali ke lobi dan mengeluh. 2. Kebisingan Kipas angin langit-langit berputar sangat keras di kamar saya. Suaranya berasal dari langit-langit dan dinding. Saya memanggil seseorang, dan mereka mengonfirmasinya. Mereka kemudian memanggil teknisi lain untuk memperbaikinya. Saya menunggu sekitar satu jam, dari pukul 22.30 hingga 23.30. 3. Hati-hati dengan kontrol AC. Anda tidak dapat mengetahui suhunya. Matikan saja jika dingin, dan nyalakan jika panas. 4. Noda di kursinya sangat parah. Saya mengirimkan ini ke teman-teman saya, dan mereka semua terkejut. Saya belum pernah melihat kursi sekotor ini di hotel bintang 5. 5. Saya berbaring untuk tidur, dan saya mencium bau pesing. Saya mengendusnya, dan ternyata baunya berasal dari bantal panjang. -> Saya tidak akan pernah mengerti mengapa hotel ini diberi peringkat 5 bintang. Saya tidak akan pernah kembali lagi. Tidak akan pernah. Saya bisa memahami kekasaran dan kurangnya perhatian staf, tetapi fasilitas lainnya sudah ketinggalan zaman. Bayangkan saja ini hotel bintang 3. Sebagai referensi, saya membayar 1.300 JPY per malam (sekitar 110.000 KRW per malam)."
"486.","ROAD SKY","10","2025-01-20","1","Ini adalah hotel bintang 5 terburuk yang pernah saya tinggali. Hotel ini berada di tepi pantai dengan harga terjangkau, jadi saya sudah menduganya, tapi ternyata memang yang terburuk. 1. Untuk mematikan lampu paling terang di foto 1, tidak ada sakelar terpisah, jadi Anda harus mematikan sakelar lampu utama di foto 2. Masalahnya, mematikan sakelar lampu utama akan mematikan semua lampu di kamar, termasuk lampu kamar mandi. Jadi, jika Anda ingin menggunakan kamar mandi sebelum tidur, Anda harus menyalakan lampu utama, yang akan menyalakan semua lampu di kamar. Jadi, kami terpaksa menggunakan senter ponsel selama menginap. Sangat merepotkan. 2. Stopkontak di foto 3 rusak dan tidak bisa digunakan. Kami bertiga, tetapi memang rusak, jadi kami terpaksa menggunakan stopkontak tunggal untuk teko kopi. Biasanya, ada stopkontak di samping tempat tidur atau tempat untuk mengisi daya perangkat, tetapi kamar saya tidak memilikinya. Saya sudah menyampaikan hal ini, dan pihak hotel bilang bisa meminjamkan kabel ekstensi, tapi mereka akan mengenakan deposit $30, jadi akhirnya saya memutuskan untuk tidak meminjamkannya. 3. Silakan lihat foto lain untuk kondisi kamar. Ada semut dan kondisi kebersihan secara keseluruhan buruk."

Balkonnya sempit, lantainya banjir, kamar mandinya bocor… Saya tidak percaya saya membayar lebih dari 70.000 rupiah untuk kamar seperti ini di Bali. Saya sangat marah. Kalau mereka menawarkan pemandangan tempat parkir, batalkan saja. Pemandangan laut atau tamannya bagus. Sebenarnya, saya menginap selama 7 malam dan memperpanjang satu malam, dan sekarang saya mendapatkan kamar ini. Kontras sekali. Sarapannya tidak berubah sejak hari ke-7, hanya dengan satu minuman. Saya akan mencari hotel lain sekarang."
"488.","Sue Johnson","34","2024-01-20","1","Hotel terburuk yang pernah saya lihat di Bali. Saya ngeri melihat apa yang mereka sebut Kamar Superior. Cat mengelupas di dinding, tempat tidur terkecil (kurang dari 183 cm), perabotan jelek, kamar mandi sangat kecil, dudukan toilet longgar, bau jamur. Langsung check out. Sekarang sudah menerima pengembalian dana sebagian."
"489.","Roheen Prentice","58","2021-01-20","1","Ada semut di kamar pertama, kamar kedua kamar mandi dan wastafel tersumbat. Tidak ada perlengkapan mandi, kamar sudah dibersihkan, sabun tidak diganti, sarung bantal kotor, menelepon ke bawah 3 kali tidak ada jawaban untuk diganti. Akhirnya, saya menerima sarung bantal baru yang berlubang. WiFi-nya bermasalah, kamar mandi tidak berfungsi. TV-nya tidak ada, tidak ada suara. Pantainya kotor dan menyedihkan. Sarapan prasmanannya enak, banyak pilihan tapi sama setiap hari, tapi Anda tidak akan bosan dengan makanannya. Banyak toko, taksi, restoran, dan tempat pijat di sekitar sini. Tidak akan menginap di sini lagi."
"490.","astrid ratna","8","2024-01-20","1","Hotelnya kurang aman di area parkir. Seharusnya pihak keamanan lebih memperhatikan. Saya baru saja kehilangan helm di area parkir hotel. Siapa tahu siapa pencurinya. Dan semua petugas keamanan sama sekali tidak membantu. Terima kasih sudah membiarkan kami menunggu selama saya hamil. Saya jadi tidak aman kalau ke sana lagi."
"491.","Rodolphe Leguian","177","2020-01-20","1","Paling bintang 3. Pelayanannya biasa saja, kualitas kamarnya lumayan, tapi ide memasang kipas angin di taman yang menghadap balkon itu konyol! Berisik SETIAP SAAT! Makanannya sangat biasa saja dan jauh dari bintang 5; sarapannya agak berantakan (kualitas prasmanannya perlu ditingkatkan). Anda bisa melihat stafnya berusaha sebaik mungkin, tapi standarnya tidak sesuai. Jelas, ada penipuan dalam peringkat bintang, dan sungguh tidak menyenangkan merasa ditipu seperti ini."
"492.","Lutz Brückner","51","2024-01-20","1","Hotel tidak mengizinkan saya check-in tanpa paspor/Kitas. Orang-orangnya rasis dan konyol setelah bertahun-tahun tinggal di Bali. KTP dan SIM lokal tidak diterima. Mereka menawari saya untuk menginap dengan membayar hampir DUA KALI LIPAT karena berkulit putih. Bali adalah tempat wisata yang menarik wisatawan asing, tetapi perlu diketahui bahwa Anda tidak diterima atau setidaknya dianggap hanya sebagai sapi perah berkulit putih - meskipun Anda tinggal di sini."
"493.","Paul Kellahan","114","2018-01-20","1","Ulasan jujur ​​tentang sebuah Resor/Hotel Bintang 5. Kami tiba di Prama beberapa jam lebih awal dari jadwal check-in yang seharusnya pukul 14.00. Setibanya di sana, kami diberitahu bahwa kami harus check-in pukul 14.00 dan mungkin akan berjalan-jalan. Kami berjalan kaki selama beberapa jam dan memutuskan untuk kembali ke Prama karena hujan deras dan kemungkinan akan turun lagi. Kami kembali sekitar pukul 13.45 dan diberitahu, Tidak, check-in pukul 14.00. Saat itu, lobi sudah penuh dengan tas dan orang-orang yang menunggu untuk masuk ke kamar mereka. Saya pikir tempat ini pasti sangat ramai! (Saya salah) Kamar pertama yang kami tempati memiliki bau cat yang sangat menyengat, saya tidak yakin bagaimana hotel bintang 5 akan mempertimbangkan untuk menerima tamu di kamar itu. Kami meminta kamar lain. Kamar yang kami tempati sebelumnya tidak berbau, tetapi wow... sangat usang dan sangat tua. Hampir sama dengan kamar sebelumnya. Mungkin 30 tahun yang lalu, ini mungkin hotel bintang 5, tetapi sekarang... ini jelas bukan hotel bintang 5, 4, atau bahkan 3. Kedua kamar yang kami tempati sangat kumuh, usang, dan kotor. Setelah check-in, kami berjalan-jalan... tempatnya tampak sepi! Kenapa harus menahan tamu di lobi padahal hampir tidak ada orang di sini, pikirku. Ada ratusan kamar di sini, pantainya kosong, kolam renangnya hanya ada segelintir orang di sekitarnya, dan semuanya terasa sangat aneh. Lorong-lorongnya berkarpet kotor dan bernoda, serta berbau sangat busuk. Selama kami menginap, beberapa kali ada nampan makanan yang tertinggal di luar kamar dan teronggok di sana hampir seharian. Suatu pagi, kami meninggalkan kamar untuk sarapan dan menemukan nampan tak jauh dari pintu yang dibuang seseorang di sana. Nampan itu masih ada di sana hingga larut malam, dan ada petugas kebersihan di lorong kami seharian membersihkan kamar. Lebih jauh di ujung lorong, ada nampan lain berisi tulang-tulang. Ketika kami melewati tempat ini sore harinya, seseorang telah menutupi nampan itu dengan serbet untuk menyembunyikan tulang-tulang itu... tetapi nampan itu tetap teronggok di sana hampir seharian. 5 Bintang??? Di pantai terdapat beberapa kursi untuk menikmati pantai, sayangnya banyak di antaranya dalam kondisi yang cukup buruk dengan lubang-lubang besar. Tempat ini benar-benar kumuh. Kolam renangnya tampak cukup bagus ketika kami pertama kali menyelam, tetapi segera terlihat ada banyak lumut hijau dan jamur, tetapi masih cukup baik untuk menyegarkan diri. Sarapannya cukup rata-rata, kualitasnya cukup buruk, tetapi mereka memiliki banyak pilihan mulai dari sereal dan buah hingga nasi goreng, egg station, panekuk, sosis, dan bacon. Itu adalah salah satu prasmanan terburuk yang pernah kami lihat dalam perjalanan kami sejauh ini. Pada hari terakhir, kami melihat prasmanan, lalu keluar dan berjalan lebih jauh ke pantai untuk menikmati sarapan sehat yang luar biasa di sebuah kafe yang tidak terlalu jauh untuk dicapai dengan berjalan kaki. Semua staf di sini sangat ramah dan membantu, dan selalu menyapa setiap kali kami lewat. Kami telah bepergian melalui Bali dan Lombok selama lebih dari 3 minggu dan memutuskan untuk memanjakan diri di resor bintang 5 untuk 3 hari terakhir kami sebelum pulang. Semua tempat yang kami kunjungi berada di antara bintang 2 dan 4. Semua hotel ini dihargai antara $45-$70 per malam dan sudah termasuk sarapan yang lezat. Semua hotel ini mengungguli Prama dalam hal kualitas kamar, fasilitas, layanan, dan makanan. Tarif menginap kami di Prama diturunkan dari $299 per malam menjadi $110 per malam, termasuk tambahan $30 per malam untuk sarapan prasmanan terburuk yang pernah kami lihat selama 3 minggu petualangan kami di Bali/Lombok. Kami meninggalkan Prama dengan perasaan sangat kecewa. Saya masih bingung mengapa hotel ini diberi peringkat 5 bintang dan sebagian besar ulasannya hanya 4-5 bintang."
"494.","jose manuel","99","2020-01-20","1","Benar-benar mengecewakan. Satu-satunya hal positifnya adalah area kolam renang dan sarapan, serta Wi-Fi yang sangat baik. Namun, pelayanannya sangat buruk. Mereka tidak membantu kami membawakan tas saat check-out, dan mereka juga menahan paspor kami sementara mobil menunggu sambil memeriksa kamar. Kamar yang kami pilih adalah kamar deluxe dengan pemandangan laut yang menghadap kolam renang. Kamarnya sangat tidak nyaman. Dingin bahkan dengan AC mati, dan jika Anda membuka teras, semuanya akan lembap. Sangat tidak nyaman tidur hanya dengan pakaian kami, dan kamarnya dingin dan lembap. Selain itu, ketika kami mematikan AC, ada dua kebocoran terus-menerus di tengah lorong, dan toiletnya terus mengalir. Kamar yang sangat buruk. Pantainya berantakan, meskipun sudah dibersihkan (mereka benar-benar mengubur sampah, dan air pasang berikutnya kembali ke air), seperti kolam. Kami hanya membasahi kaki kami, yang agak menjijikkan. Pantainya terisi dan kosong dua kali sehari. Kami tidak bisa menggunakannya. Kami berjemur di pantai, tapi berenang di kolam renang. Sejauh ini, ini adalah hotel terburuk kami di Bali. Kami merindukan kenyamanan hotel bintang 2-3 yang kami singgahi di Ubud. Setelah dua malam, kami pindah ke Amed, yang airnya sangat jernih dan pilihan hotelnya luas dan terjangkau. Saya tidak merekomendasikan hotel ini kecuali untuk Wi-Fi-nya yang sangat bagus."
"495.","nita malasari","22","2025-01-20","1","Saya pernah ke sini, dan staf bernama Rindra PA, petugas kebersihan toilet, mengetuk pintu saat saya masih di dalam toilet. Saya mencoba memberitahunya bahwa apa yang dia lakukan salah. Dia tidak mau meminta maaf dan langsung pergi begitu saja!! Orang ini benar-benar tidak punya sikap sama sekali terhadap pelanggan! Hotelnya bagus, tetapi staf seperti ini tidak baik di sini!!!"
"496.","Rea Lux","42","2020-01-20","1","Hebat, kami memesan hotel ini karena mengiklankan kolam renang anak-anak yang bagus dengan perosotan. Tapi sedang dalam pembangunan, yang sudah terjadi beberapa waktu - ada banyak foto-foto yang bagus ini. Benda yang benar-benar berkarat yang seharusnya dirobohkan itu berdiri di sana, jelas bahwa anak berusia 3 tahun tidak akan memahaminya... mereka menjanjikan sesuatu dan kemudian hal seperti itu terjadi. Ini jelas bukan hotel bintang 5, kami menghabiskan beberapa minggu terakhir di homestay bintang 2 dengan harga 1/3 dan mereka 100% lebih baik daripada hotel ini. Sambutannya tidak istimewa, hanya bagaimana Anda ingin membayar. Tidak ada yang dijelaskan. Tidak ada informasi yang diberikan juga. Kamar-kamarnya bau furnitur lama. Benar-benar apak. Untungnya kami hanya memesan 2 malam dan saya harap pakaian kami tidak mulai berbau apak. AC-nya berisik dan berbau aneh, tetapi kami tidak bisa hidup tanpanya. Itu menciptakan kelembapan ekstrem di dalam kamar. Kamarnya sangat kecil, begitu pula kamar mandinya. Kami tidak memesan sarapan, ada restoran yang lebih murah di daerah ini yang tidak perlu membayar €12 untuk sarapan. Yang penting, stafnya main sepatu roda di restoran dekat pantai dan kolam renang. Betapa bodohnya itu di hotel bintang 5? Hmm? Mereka tidak memperhatikan di kolam renang, dan mereka ingin meninggalkan minuman kami di lantai sampai saya meminta mereka untuk memesan meja kecil, yang ada di mana-mana. Jujur saja, tidak akan pernah lagi."
"497.","Kevin Aus","21","2018-01-20","1","Hotel ini tua, ketinggalan zaman, dan bobrok. Makanan, termasuk sarapan, tidak sesuai standar dengan harga yang dibayarkan. Kecepatan wifi sangat buruk, bahkan untuk ukuran Bali. Saya pernah melihat internet yang lebih cepat di homestay. Pantainya kotor dan tidak cocok untuk berenang karena banyak perahu dan lalu lintas air yang sangat dekat dengan pantai. Manajer menolak untuk menanggapi permintaan apa pun. Hindari hotel ini dengan segala cara."
"498.","Andrea Sliz","1","2024-01-20","1","Kami menginap di hotel ini. Kami tiba kemarin. Mereka baru bisa memberi kami kamar setelah pukul 15.00, yang seharusnya tidak menjadi masalah. Namun, kamar yang kami dapatkan kotor, furniturnya bobrok, handuknya, saya hanya akan menyebutkan handuk mandinya, tidak ada handuk yang kotor, tua, dan usang. Tidak ada pengering untuk pakaian renang atau handuk basah. Dindingnya kotor dan saya bahkan tidak akan menyebutkan balkonnya. Kami pergi ke Bali, kami selalu menginap di berbagai tempat di pulau ini, tetapi kami belum pernah diberi kamar seburuk ini. Kami berjarak 11.000 km dari rumah, tetapi saya tidak pernah menyangka bahwa kompleks hotel seperti ini akan memiliki lubang kotor yang bisa digunakan."
"499.","Mich g","12","2023-01-20","1","Harganya terlalu mahal untuk kamar-kamar kecil yang berjamur, air panas baru tersedia 5 menit, AC digunakan bersama dan tidak berfungsi dengan baik. Bisa mendapatkan vila pribadi yang MENAKJUBKAN dengan harga lebih murah dan jauh lebih baik. Terlalu mahal! Bangunan tua dan kumuh."
"500.","Angelika Pechlaner","31","2017-01-20","1","Kami menantikan liburan pantai selama seminggu di hotel bintang 5. Pantainya luas tetapi kotor; Anda dapat menemukan apa saja, mulai dari sampah plastik hingga rumput laut. Bahkan potongan kayu besar dari perahu tua yang terdampar saat air pasang. Tentang hotel itu sendiri: Staf resepsionis sangat tidak ramah sejak tahap check-in. Kamar-kamarnya ketinggalan zaman dan tidak bersih. Wi-Fi-nya hampir tidak berfungsi. Dindingnya sangat tipis sehingga Anda dapat mendengar semuanya, sepanjang waktu. Cermin di kamar mandi kami berkarat tepat di tengahnya, dan air dari pancuran yang setengah terbuka terus merembes ke seluruh kamar mandi. Pada malam pertama, selimut hanya dimasukkan ke dalam dua lembar, dan rambut tamu terlihat. Kami mungkin hanya mendapatkan selimut yang layak karena kami buru-buru merekatkan kedua lembar itu dengan lakban. Bahkan TV-nya pun hanya berfungsi sesekali. Ketika kamar dibersihkan, hanya tempat tidur yang dirapikan, dan dengan handuk di kamar mandi, kami harus beruntung mendapatkan dua handuk besar dan dua handuk kecil. Bagi saya, apa yang didapat selalu tergantung keberuntungan; kami selalu meletakkan dua cangkir di samping ketel, tetapi selalu hanya satu sendok, misalnya. Konsistensi ini terasa meresap ke mana-mana; semuanya baru setengah jadi. Kami khususnya berada di kamar dengan balkon di mana saya diizinkan merokok, tetapi saya tidak mendapatkan asbak sampai di penghujung kamar. Saya suka kolam renangnya, dan staf di bar pantai sangat ramah, meskipun agak lambat dan pelupa. Saya senang mendapatkan penawaran khusus; jika tidak, saya mungkin akan lebih kecewa lagi. Area luar hotel juga sangat bagus dan tampak terawat dengan baik. Namun, secara keseluruhan, hotel ini jauh dari layak mendapatkan peringkat bintang 5."
"501.","A (Andy)","407","2020-01-20","1","Kecewa. Akomodasi termahal yang pernah saya bayar di Bali dan sejauh ini yang terburuk dari semuanya. Anda bisa mendapatkan jauh lebih baik daripada hotel kuno ini untuk uang Anda. Jangan tergiur dengan hotel bintang 5, Anda akan merasa seperti di hotel keluarga murahan yang berebut makanan di prasmanan."

"504.","Sue Gibb","3","2023-01-20","1","Kami telah menginap di Prama berkali-kali - kami memesan 10 malam dari 6 Agustus dan check out setelah 1 malam. Hotel ini seharusnya tidak mengiklankan kamar di halaman perjalanan mana pun - Separuh hotel tutup, tidak ada bar kolam renang, ruang sarapan tutup dan hanya menyajikan sarapan di restoran Basilco, dan sarapannya sangat terbatas - mereka mengiklankan bahwa kamar telah terjual habis, tetapi sebenarnya tidak terjual habis. Kamar-kamar tersebut tutup karena tidak layak huni dan tidak mampu diperbaiki. Kondisinya sangat kumuh, kotor, dan ujung Sanur seperti lokasi konstruksi di tepi pantai dengan jalan setapak yang dirobohkan dan peringatan dibongkar, sementara sisi jalan seperti kota hantu, sebagian besar restoran tutup. Foto-foto hotel di Expedia, booking.com, dll. tidak mencerminkan betapa buruknya hotel ini - sangat mengecewakan karena ini adalah hotel favorit kami, tetapi mereka telah membawa kami kembali ke sisi Legian sekarang, tempat kami menginap di Niksoma dan hotel ini sangat indah."
"505.","Nelson Drt 33","1","2017-01-20","1","Liburan keluarga! Kecewa dengan hotel ini, yang terlihat bagus berdasarkan ulasan dan foto, tetapi begitu Anda tiba, Anda melihat kenyataan. Kami dipijat, tetapi stafnya sama sekali tidak profesional. Pijatannya sangat kasar dan sama sekali tidak menyenangkan. Mereka menggunakan produk supermarket, dan di akhir layanan, kami dibiarkan mengurus diri sendiri, pergi berpakaian, dll., tanpa penjelasan apa pun. Dan untuk makanannya, kami mengalami keracunan makanan. Koneksi Wi-Fi-nya tidak berfungsi dengan baik. Dan sebelum meninggalkan kamar, salah satu staf housekeeping mencoba mencuri ponsel kami dan bahkan mencoba mencari kode sandi. Ini benar-benar tidak dapat diterima. Saya tidak merekomendasikan hotel ini!"
"506.","Joe B","25","2016-01-20","1","Tidak direkomendasikan! Jet ski dan perahu karet serta parasut di resor ini seringkali terlalu dekat dengan para penyelam snorkel dan perenang – bahkan di zona aman di antara pelampung! Saya merasa ini sangat menjengkelkan, karena saya ingin menunjukkan cara snorkeling kepada anak saya yang berusia 5 tahun. Berdebat dengan staf dan mengeluh di meja layanan pelanggan tidak membawa saya ke mana pun (petugas meja hampir tidak bisa berbahasa Inggris). Di sisi lain, hotel ini tidak lebih dari pabrik turis dengan kamar-kamar seperti kotak korek api yang berjejer di tempat yang anonim dan tidak ramah, tidak sepadan dengan harga yang dibayarkan. Karena itu, kami memutuskan untuk pergi meskipun uang kami tidak dikembalikan."
"507.","Rey de Opiniones","21","2020-01-20","1","Staf resepsionis tidak terorganisir, kesulitan melakukan check-in, dan mencoba menagih saya dua kali lipat tarif sesuai reservasi.

Praktik ini seharusnya tidak diizinkan dan klien yang ingin menggunakannya harus diprioritaskan."
"508.","Jaky Connan","58","2023-01-20","1","Mungkin karena pandemi COVID-19 saat ini. TAPI restorannya biasa saja. Sarapannya minim. Kolam renang hijau besar di sekitarnya.

"582.","Sebastian Krebs","17","2025-11-20","2","Sebaiknya jangan. Hotel ini mungkin pernah mengalami masa kejayaannya 30 tahun yang lalu. Meskipun perbaikan kosmetik yang sangat dibutuhkan sebagian besar telah dilakukan, modernisasi apa pun tampaknya terabaikan sejak pembangunannya. Positifnya antara lain pemandangan dari lantai atas, lokasi pantai, lobi yang cantik, taman yang terawat baik namun membosankan, dan staf yang selalu ramah. Internetnya stabil dan cukup cepat untuk panggilan video. Positifnya antara lain suasana yang kuno di dalam dan luar, jendela dan karpet yang kotor, ubin yang pecah di area kolam renang (saya merobek baju renang saya saat bermain seluncuran air), ukuran hotel, kualitas sarapan yang buruk, reservasi kursi santai kolam renang beserta handuk... Dengan harga 2,5 juta rupiah per malam, ini sungguh memalukan di Bali. Tiga akomodasi kami yang lain di Bali jauh lebih bagus dan harganya kurang dari setengahnya. Dengan harga segitu, saya bisa menemukan hotel yang lebih bagus bahkan di kota-kota termahal di dunia. Berjalan di sepanjang dermaga, Anda dapat melihat kontras yang mencolok dengan hotel-hotel lain, yang tampak jauh lebih segar dan lebih bagus (dengan harga yang sama). Saya memiliki ekspektasi yang berbeda terhadap hotel dengan peringkat bintang 5. Mungkin lebih baik hotel ini ditutup dan memberi ruang bagi para pengusaha yang memahami bisnis perhotelan abad ke-21."
"583.","Andrea","30","2026-01-06","2","Kekurangan: Hotel berbau pesing. Kamar kotor, ada jamur di kamar mandi, dan handuk sudah sangat usang. Kelebihan: Akses langsung ke pantai, pelayanan bagus, dan sarapan berlimpah. Area umum bagus dan ramah keluarga. Kesimpulan: Anda terutama membayar untuk akses pantai dan fasilitas bersama."
"584.","Patrick","36","2026-01-06","2","Kami menghabiskan Malam Tahun Baru 2025 di sana. Kamarnya baik-baik saja, kecuali kunci elektroniknya tidak berfungsi. Area kolam renangnya lumayan, tetapi agak kotor. Menu Malam Tahun Baru cukup baik, seperti biasa untuk hotel yang mengklaim sebagai hotel bintang 5 dan menawarkan hidangan gourmet, tetapi porsinya tidak terlalu banyak. Pesta Malam Tahun Baru dengan musik live dan DJ kurang memuaskan; sulit untuk berinteraksi dengan para tamu sementara tim manajemen saling memberi selamat di atas panggung pada pukul 23:20. Suasana tetap cukup membosankan. Selain itu, ketika Anda memesan minuman pada pukul 00:30, pelayan memberi tahu Anda bahwa mereka sudah tutup. Singkatnya, ketika tidak ada yang berfungsi, sulit untuk merasa senang dengan masa menginap Anda."
"585.","Natália Ramos","47","2026-01-06","2","Hotel ini memiliki lokasi yang bagus. Dekat dengan pantai-pantai yang bagus, restoran, dan hanya beberapa menit berjalan kaki dari pusat kota. Namun, hotel ini membutuhkan perbaikan yang serius. Meskipun kamar-kamar dibersihkan setiap hari, terdapat bau yang sangat tidak sedap. Perabotan terlihat sangat tua, kasur dan bantal tidak nyaman, dan tidak ada penerangan di kamar. Saya percaya hotel ini terlalu dibesar-besarkan, dan tidak sepadan dengan harganya. Ada akomodasi lain di area tersebut dengan harga yang lebih terjangkau dan kualitas yang lebih baik."
"586.","В П","2","2026-01-06","2","Standar hotel jauh di bawah apa yang diklaimnya. Sayangnya, ini adalah tempat keempat di Bali selama perjalanan tiga minggu kami, dan ternyata yang terburuk. Harganya sebanding dengan hotel di Nusa Duo, tetapi semuanya ternyata sangat mengecewakan! Pelayanannya buruk, kamarnya kecil dan kumuh, dan terasa seperti mereka mencoba menghemat biaya di mana-mana. Bahkan bungalow bintang 3 kami jauh lebih bagus. Sangat menjengkelkan tidur di atas seprai basah dan kasur dengan luka baring. Tolong jangan ulangi kesalahan kami. Saya akan menambahkan ulasan saya: kami meningkatkan ke kamar dengan kasur yang layak, tetapi ukurannya lebih kecil. Kolam renang utama berbahaya; ubinnya retak, saya mengalami tiga cedera, dan sangat tidak menyenangkan untuk keluar dengan kaki berdarah."
"587.","Paul Zuijdweg","47","2025-10-20","2","Hotelnya tampak bagus. Kamar-kamarnya sangat kuno dan kurang terawat. Jalan setapaknya tampak bersih, tetapi sudut-sudutnya tidak pernah dibersihkan. Kolam renangnya juga banyak ubinnya pecah dan ada perbaikan sementara. Di sini pun, pemeliharaannya buruk/tidak efektif. Stafnya jauh kurang ramah dibandingkan hotel lain. Rasanya seluruh staf diremehkan. Stafnya seolah-olah melihat langsung ke dalam diri Anda. AC-nya tampaknya bisa diatur, tetapi tidak berfungsi. Performanya sangat buruk. Karena ini salah satu hotel terakhir di boulevard, tempat ini sepi di malam hari. Karena hari mulai gelap, Anda merasa tidak aman. Ada musik live setiap hari di bar pantai, yang seringkali membuat Anda meringis dan sumbang. Kolam renangnya luas, dan suhu airnya sangat nyaman. Di pagi hari, Anda harus meletakkan handuk sekitar pukul 7:00 pagi, jika tidak, tidak akan ada ruang tersisa. Kursi santai yang tersedia terlalu sedikit untuk jumlah tamu. Saya penasaran apakah mereka akan mempertahankan peringkat bintang 5 mereka setelah diperiksa ulang."
"588.","Thomas","212","2025-10-20","2","Secara keseluruhan, saya kurang puas. Kami bahkan belum 30 menit di kamar ketika tiba-tiba air hujan turun deras. Kami berlari ke resepsionis, di mana seorang manajer dengan tenang memberi tahu kami bahwa kami bisa pindah ke kamar lain, tetapi kami harus menunggu di lobi. Sayangnya, hampir tidak ada permintaan maaf. Ini bukan karena hujan; cuacanya kering. Kami kemudian ditempatkan di bagian belakang hotel, jauh dari pintu masuk. Kami menginap di kamar yang sama, yang cukup menyenangkan. Makanan di pagi hari sungguh luar biasa. Banyak variasinya, tetapi ini tidak memberi Anda nuansa Bali. Suasananya seperti makan sepuasnya di Turki di mana orang-orang terus-menerus berbaur dan Anda harus mencari tempat yang tenang untuk makan. Selain itu, percayalah atau tidak (di Bali), Anda harus meletakkan handuk di kolam renang. Semua kursi santai ditutupi handuk, dan staf tidak melakukan apa pun untuk mengatasinya. AC di kamar tidur kami juga berisik, tetapi itu memang terjadi. Secara keseluruhan, kami tidak memiliki pengalaman yang positif. Menurut standar Bali, ini sungguh buruk, terutama untuk harga yang Anda bayar."
"589.","Kev Lee","7","2025-12-30","2","Pertama-tama, tempat ini benar-benar sangat tua... sekitar 40 tahun. Saya melihat kecoa, dan ketika hujan, jalan setapak di resor ini banjir dan drainasenya buruk. Lanskapnya bagus, tetapi stafnya tidak terlalu ramah. Kolam renangnya lumayan, tetapi secara keseluruhan, saya tidak akan merekomendasikannya."
"590.","Hans Elshout","36","2025-09-20","2","Maaf, hotel ini saat ini tidak pantas mendapatkan bintang 4 atau 5 sama sekali. Hotel ini sudah berusia lebih dari 50 tahun dan semuanya SANGAT perlu ditingkatkan. Bahkan lokasinya yang dekat pantai, dengan banyaknya anjing liar, sangat buruk kebersihannya. Hal ini tampaknya juga memengaruhi jumlah pelanggan yang datang. Kombinasi semua ini berakibat fatal. Stafnya sangat ramah dan membantu. Tetapi bahkan mereka pun tidak dapat menutupi kesenjangan yang sangat besar antara harapan dan kenyataan sebuah hotel bintang 5. Dari semua 8 hotel selama tur kami di Indonesia—baik bintang 4 maupun 5—ini adalah pengalaman yang paling negatif. Kami hanya menanggung kerugian finansial kami dan pindah ke hotel yang lebih baik dalam waktu 4 jam!—bukannya 4 malam."
"591.","Yulian","4","2025-12-20","2","Hotel yang sangat tua, yang mungkin merupakan hotel terbaik 30-40 tahun yang lalu tetapi sekarang membutuhkan renovasi mendesak. Untungnya, stafnya ramah dan membantu. Anda dapat menemukan hotel yang jauh lebih baik di sini."
"592.","Jesslyn Azalia","17","2025-08-20","2","Pengalaman saya sejauh ini kurang memuaskan. Saya tiba di hotel sekitar pukul 15.00-15.30, yang berarti 1,5 jam setelah waktu check-in yang seharusnya, tetapi saya tiba dan mendapati kamar belum siap. Karena setahu saya, waktu check-out seharusnya sekitar pukul 11.00-12.00. Jadi saya tidak mengerti kenapa dengan selisih waktu 3,5 jam, kamar masih belum siap. Dan setelah masuk kamar, saya baru menyadari bahwa kamarnya sangat tua dan sebagian besar furniturnya agak retak. Sebagai hotel bintang 5, rasanya tidak masuk akal. Toiletnya juga sangat bau ketika saya masuk. Belum lagi liftnya tidak berfungsi."
"593.","Francesca Bahoum","13","2025-08-20","2","INI BUKAN RESOR BINTANG 5. Tidak ada yang istimewa dari hotel ini yang berbintang 5. Hotel ini perlu direnovasi total. Kami telah menginap di resor bintang 5 di seluruh dunia dan ini adalah hotel terburuk yang pernah kami tinggali. Cat dinding mengelupas, jamur di kamar mandi, dinding kamar tidur kotor, paku berkarat, tirai jaring berdebu dan berjamur, kolong tempat tidur kotor - Kami punya 2 kamar, 302 dan 306, semuanya buruk. Kami sekeluarga berempat, jadi terpaksa menyewa 2 kamar yang membuat biayanya dua kali lipat. Kebanyakan hotel memiliki kamar keluarga yang bisa kami tempati bersama. Kolam renang anak-anak berkarat, ubin di kolam renang anak-anak perlu diganti, beberapa perlengkapan kolam renang anak lainnya tidak berfungsi atau sudah sangat rusak. Sarapan - pilihannya biasa saja. Tidak ada yang istimewa, tapi tidak buruk. Mereka tidak menunjukkan meja sehingga Anda harus berkeliling mencari meja kosong. Makan siangnya biasa saja. Kopi dan teh di kamar tidur tidak pernah diisi ulang. Banyak orang yang datang dari jalanan dan mengambil kursi berjemur tanpa membayar, padahal mereka tidak menginap di sini. Stafnya ramah dan lokasinya cukup bagus. Hanya itu saja yang bisa menggambarkan betapa bagusnya tempat ini. Saya masih menginap di sini sampai Sabtu, tapi saya tidak sabar untuk pergi. Hindari tempat ini dengan segala cara!"
"594.","Micaela Blanco","28","2025-07-20","2","Kalau Anda tidak berharap hotel bintang 5 sungguhan, hotel ini akan baik-baik saja. Departemen tata graha sangat buruk. Saat check-in, kulkas di kamar kotor (saya sempat komplain, dan mereka membersihkannya setelah 3 hari). Setiap kali mereka membersihkan kamar, bantal-bantalnya selalu ditaruh di lantai (yang di beberapa bagian penuh semut). Pelayanannya lumayan, restorannya lambat, kopinya dingin, dan mereka tidak tahu bagaimana menangani keluhan. Yang perlu saya soroti, kolam renangnya, dan kolam renang untuk anak-anak. Dan lokasinya juga bagus, menurut saya Sanur luar biasa untuk keluarga."
"595.","Jacob Gilbert","3","2025-08-20","2","Saya tidak akan merekomendasikan tempat ini kecuali beberapa perbaikan serius terjadi dalam hal fasilitas dan staf. Kamar kami tidak siap ketika kami tiba dan satu jam kemudian ketika itu selesai seprai kami kotor. Housekeeping jarang mengubah hal-hal yang perlu diganti seperti gelas, mug dan kertas toilet. Kontrol AC kami tidak berfungsi dan macet pada pengaturan terendah yang membuatnya sangat dingin, dan ketika pemeliharaan datang, mereka hanya memindahkan ventilasi untuk menghadap ke dinding yang berlawanan alih-alih memperbaiki masalah utama. Kolam renang adalah zona perang orang-orang yang berebut kursi dek, satu keluarga bahkan sampai membayar staf untuk meletakkan mainan kolam renang di 7 kursi dek sebelum kolam renang dibuka. Satu-satunya hal yang dimiliki tempat ini adalah lokasinya karena memiliki akses yang bagus ke pantai dan beberapa tempat musik yang bagus meskipun berjalan kaki sebentar di sepanjang pantai akan membuat Anda merasa tertekan melihat semua hotel lain yang mengalahkan prama."
"596.","M&mC","43","2025-06-20","2","- Hotel ini bukan hotel bintang 5.

"597.","John Barnes","77","2025-10-20","2","Hotelnya agak kuno. Sarapannya berantakan. Banyak tamu yang meletakkan handuk di kursi santai kolam renang sangat pagi, lalu tidak menggunakannya seharian. Tidak akan kembali ke hotel ini."
"598.","Gianluca Trentani","9","2025-04-20","2","Pengalaman Mengecewakan Resor ini berlokasi strategis, dan area luar ruangannya terawat dengan baik, memberikan kesan awal yang positif. Namun, pantainya terbengkalai dan penuh plastik. Kamar-kamarnya sangat tua, dan kamar mandinya perlu direnovasi total. Kamar-kamar tersebut jelas tidak setara dengan resor bintang 5. Kebersihan kamar merupakan masalah utama (kamar kami bernomor 373); saat kami tiba, handuk tidak tersedia, dan kamar mandi tidak dibersihkan dengan benar. Selama 3 malam menginap, kamar tidak pernah dibersihkan (hanya tempat tidur yang dirapikan). Selain itu, kelembapan di dalam kamar sangat tidak tertahankan. Resor ini juga penuh sesak dengan keluarga, dan kebisingan terus-menerus terjadi sepanjang hari, siang dan malam. Secara keseluruhan, pengalaman yang mengecewakan. Saran perbaikan: Kebersihan: Pastikan kamar dibersihkan setiap hari dan handuk selalu tersedia. Renovasi: Investasikan untuk merenovasi kamar dan kamar mandi agar lebih modern dan nyaman, dan yang terpenting, mengurangi kelembapan. Manajemen Pantai: Terapkan program pembersihan rutin untuk menjaga pantai bebas dari plastik dan sampah. Pengendalian Kebisingan: Buat area khusus keluarga dan area yang lebih tenang bagi mereka yang ingin bersantai, dan terapkan aturan untuk mengurangi kebisingan di malam hari. Pengelolaan Kelembapan: Tingkatkan ventilasi ruangan untuk mengurangi kelembapan dan memastikan lingkungan yang lebih sehat. Saya tidak merekomendasikan hal ini."

Secara keseluruhan, hotel ini tidak terlalu buruk, tetapi saya sama sekali tidak merekomendasikannya untuk liburan yang tenang.

Sayangnya, hanya itu saja. Saya masuk ke kamar dan rasanya seperti kembali ke masa puluhan tahun yang lalu! Entah kapan hotel ini dibangun, tapi kamar-kamarnya sangat ketinggalan zaman. Sepertinya tempat sampahnya sudah ada di kamar mandi sejak hotel ini dibuka, benar-benar berkerak dan berkarat. Saya membayar cukup mahal untuk kamarnya, tapi sungguh tidak sepadan. Ternyata, kita harus membayar untuk lokasinya, yang sebenarnya sangat bagus. Kamar-kamarnya juga dibersihkan dengan sangat buruk; yang dilakukan hanyalah merapikan tempat tidur dan mengganti handuk serta perlengkapan mandi. Mereka meninggalkan sampah, botol kosong, dan sebagainya; mungkin kami seharusnya melakukannya sendiri... sayangnya, lain kali saya tidak akan menginap di Prama lagi."
"605.","Josephine Tomasello","30","2025-01-20","2","Prama Sanur Beach tidak layak disebut resor bintang 4 sejati. Bangunannya tampak sangat tua.

Stafnya berusaha sebaik mungkin. Orang-orang Bali sangat ramah dan selalu tersenyum, tetapi sopan santun mereka tidak menutupi kualitas hotel yang biasa-biasa saja. Jika saya kembali ke Bali, saya pasti tidak akan menginap di properti ini lagi."
"606.","AME","8","2025-01-20","2","Kami baru saja tiba dari Novotel, Lombok, di mana semuanya luar biasa, mulai dari dekorasi hingga layanan.

Catnya terkelupas, kasurnya tua dan penyok, serta seprai bersih tapi terlalu sering dipakai—untuk pertama kalinya dalam perjalanan saya, saya mencari kutu busuk, saya sangat ragu; airnya hangat, bukan panas; fungsional tapi lebih menyedihkan daripada lingkungan yang mengesankan. Tidak akan pernah lagi diberi pilihan di Bali."

Kedap suaranya kurang, jadi suara pintu kamar lain yang dibanting saat mereka datang dan pergi sangat berisik. Selebihnya, stafnya sangat ramah dan tempat tidur saya nyaman. Propertinya sendiri cantik dan lokasinya bagus, meskipun mereka sedang melakukan pembangunan di kolam renang sehingga kolam renang BUKAN tempat yang menenangkan dan kolam renangnya beroperasi sepanjang hari (tidak ada pemberitahuan saat check-in). Sarapan keesokan harinya adalah prasmanan mewah yang menurut saya biasa saja. Saya tidak akan menginap di sini lagi. Sagara Suites sangat dekat dan menawarkan pengalaman dan sarapan yang jauh lebih baik!!"
"608.","Saskia De Vos","3","2024-01-20","2","Kejayaan yang memudar. Kamar dan hotelnya jelas tidak layak mendapat peringkat bintang 5. Kamar-kamarnya ketinggalan zaman dan kurang bersih.

Di sana juga terdapat kursi pantai yang melorot, terlalu sedikit payung, dan bantal yang kotor. Handuk pantai yang tua, kotor, dan sudah dicuci disediakan gratis."
"609.","Paul Hobbs","31","2024-01-20","2","Kesan pertama saya adalah stafnya tidak tertarik saat check-in, yang sangat tidak biasa bagi kami karena kami belum pernah mengalami hal seperti ini selama 25 tahun kami datang ke Bali. Stafnya lebih acuh tak acuh daripada yang pernah kami lihat (meskipun beberapa di antaranya sangat baik). Kebersihan juga mengejutkan. Toilet kami masih berceceran di mangkuk toilet, jadi jelas tidak dibersihkan dengan benar oleh penghuni sebelumnya. Saya terkejut dengan ulasan-ulasan bagus yang diterima hotel ini. Kami telah berkeliling pulau selama 3 minggu terakhir dan menginap di berbagai akomodasi. Sayangnya, ini adalah yang terburuk dan kami tidak akan kembali. Kekecewaan terakhir adalah meja transportasi yang tidak memesankan Taksi Blue Bird untuk kami dan mencoba menipu kami dengan layanannya sendiri."

"612.","Charleen Brinkmann","3","2024-01-20","2","Saya benar-benar TIDAK merekomendasikan hotel ini. Kami memesan melalui agen. Setibanya di sana, kami disambut oleh staf yang sangat ramah, tetapi itu juga kesan positif pertama dan, untuk saat ini, yang terakhir. Ketika kami akhirnya mencapai kamar kami melalui kompleks hotel yang luas, kami disambut oleh bau yang tidak sedap. Setelah memeriksa kamar lebih lanjut, kami melihat pertumbuhan jamur yang luas di kamar mandi dan noda gelap di dinding. Handuk kotor digunakan sebagai penutup oleh teman sekamar yang lebih kecil dan tidak diinginkan seperti semut, ngengat, dan kumbang. Belum lagi serangga kecil di tempat tidur dan di bawah seprai kotor – tetapi harapan itu pupus... Staf yang ramah di resepsionis memesankan kami kembali ke kamar lain atas permintaan kami. Kami melihat kamar baru kami dengan harapan positif, tetapi dengan itu, harapan kami pupus. Handuk kotor, keran wastafel kotor, dan rambut di tempat tidur yang baru dirapikan, bersama laba-laba dan ngengat yang menggantung di langit-langit, hanyalah hiasan di atas kue... Seorang karyawan hotel yang ramah mencoba mengeluarkan laba-laba itu dari langit-langit dan keluar dari kamar dengan gagang sapu yang panjang, tetapi hanya berhasil menjatuhkannya dari langit-langit ke lantai, di mana laba-laba itu mengambil kesempatan dan merangkak di belakang tempat tidur. Sambil tersenyum dan mengubah sapu menjadi gitar udara, karyawan itu kemudian meninggalkan kamar, meninggalkan kami dengan nasib kami. Meskipun laba-laba itu kemungkinan akan terus mendatangkan malapetaka di masa mendatang, kami berhasil menyingkirkan ngengat itu sendiri. Malam yang kurang lebih tanpa tidur mengantar kami untuk sarapan pagi. Bagian terbaiknya adalah pemandangannya. Lokasi hotel, tepat di pantai, sangat bagus, begitu pula staf hotelnya. Pemandangan laut yang indah dan staf yang ramah mempermanis kopi pahit, yang tidak dapat diminum bahkan dengan susu. Saya menulis teks ini sementara laba-laba di kamar saya mungkin sedang tertawa terbahak-bahak, dan saya berharap semua pembaca lebih sukses dalam memilih hotel."

Kamar mandinya cukup buruk karena tidak ada fungsi bidet/pijat bokong, yang wajib di Indonesia, dan tisu toilet sulit dijangkau. Banyak stopkontak di kamar tidak berfungsi. Ini adalah pilihan yang buruk bagi kami karena sarapannya (hanya lumayan, tidak enak), tidak menarik, dan satu-satunya alasan Anda akan menginap di sini mengingat kamarnya yang tua, buruk, dan kecil, adalah akses pantai dan area kolam renang. Seharusnya kami menginap di tempat lain karena kami tidak menggunakan atau tertarik dengan fasilitas tersebut. Jika Anda menginginkan fasilitas ini, Anda bisa menginap di sini, tetapi bagi kami ini adalah pilihan yang buruk, dan kami pindah ke hotel lain dengan setengah harga dan kamar yang lebih modern."

Tempat tidurnya juga kurang nyaman. Satu hal yang menonjol adalah area kolam renangnya. Ada area anak-anak yang cukup bagus, terpisah dari kolam renang dewasa. Itu berarti saya tidak perlu memastikan anak-anak saya tidak mengganggu siapa pun, dan itu luar biasa! Makanannya lumayan. Tidak enak dan terlalu mahal."

Siapa pun yang memesan kamar di sini harus tahu bahwa mereka menginap di kompleks yang sangat besar dengan lebih dari 400 kamar, dan selalu sangat ramai. Pengalaman menginap kami lumayan, tetapi kamar dan kolam renangnya agak ketinggalan zaman. Semuanya sangat usang, brankas hanya berfungsi sebagian, dan kamarnya sangat pengap. Anda tidak akan menemukan kedamaian dan ketenangan di tepi kolam renang atau saat sarapan karena keramaian. Namun, stafnya ramah dan membantu, dan makanannya lumayan (meskipun kami pernah menikmati sarapan yang jauh lebih enak di hotel lain)."
"616.","Phineas Maruti","152","2024-01-20","2","Lampu utama di kamar saya tidak menyala. Bau air di toilet sangat menyengat. Lantai di bawah tempat tidur masih kotor, seperti petugas kebersihan yang tidak membersihkannya dengan baik. Handuk tidak tersedia saat kami datang, padahal mereka berjanji akan menyediakannya dalam 30 menit. Namun, setelah 3 jam, tidak ada yang mengantarkannya sampai kami harus meneleponnya dua kali. Resepsionis menerima keluhan saya tentang handuk, tetapi meneruskannya ke petugas kebersihan, tetapi petugas kebersihan tidak mengangkatnya. Sepertinya tamu yang harus sibuk menelepon petugas kebersihan sendiri... yang sangat aneh. Pencahayaannya sangat remang-remang.

Fasilitasnya umumnya sudah ketinggalan zaman."

Sarapan prasmanan, meskipun berlimpah dan lengkap, rasanya sangat buruk; sulit untuk makan sepuasnya di pagi hari. Pantainya lumayan, tetapi saya lebih suka pantai pribadi yang sedikit lebih bersih... Semuanya sangat komersial dan sayangnya tidak seramah yang kami alami di hotel lain di Bali.

Para tamu harus mengambil kopi sendiri, yang tidak disediakan oleh sistem. Perabotan kamar agak buruk. Kamar mandinya kurang luas."
"625.","A-FA Fabien","20","2019-01-20","2","Hotel bergaya 90-an yang bagus dengan dua kolam renang dan pemandangan tepi laut. Tamannya indah. Namun, hotelnya sudah tua. Kolam renang anak-anak tidak selalu berfungsi (pompa rusak dan perosotannya tidak berfungsi). Beberapa elemen tidak memenuhi standar keselamatan anak. Pelayanannya bagus, tetapi hindari opsi all-inclusive, yang sebenarnya tidak all-inclusive. Banyak layanan berbayar. Jangan pergi ke fotografer kecuali Anda benar-benar berhemat. Lebih dari 1 juta untuk 15 foto dalam satu CD. Namun, hotelnya bersih dan stafnya ramah. Kekurangan utamanya adalah biaya tambahan di bar pantai dan restoran yang biasanya sudah termasuk dalam opsi all-inclusive."
"626.","Levend Theater (Lucas Clarijs)","8","2019-01-20","2","Tempat yang indah di pantai. Dengan R150.000 per orang, Anda bisa menggunakan kursi berjemur dan perlengkapan mandi. Sebaiknya jangan makan di sini (baik di Pantai maupun di Bamboo Bar). Salad Caesar-nya sangat buruk (hanya selada dengan saus yang melimpah), dan daging dari burgernya tidak diperbolehkan lagi. Kalau saya memakannya, saya pasti akan muntah. Enak untuk minum, tapi tidak lebih."
"627.","Oliver Bühler","446","2017-01-20","2","Hotel pertama kami di Bali setelah penerbangan dan tujuan yang tepat untuk menginap semalam setelah penerbangan panjang. Kamar pertama yang kami dapatkan sangat jelek, tua, dan tidak sesuai dengan foto kamar yang kami pesan. Setelah dua kali komplain, kami mendapatkan kamar yang layak dan sisa malam itu menyenangkan. Kami memesan prasmanan All-You-Can Eat di tengah hotel. Saya suka, tetapi sebaiknya datang lebih awal jika ingin menikmati setiap hidangan."
"628.","정기석","1","2025-01-20","2","Ruangan itu sangat, sangat, sangat panas. Saya merasa seperti berkeringat lagi setelah mandi. AC-nya sepertinya mendinginkan ruangan di siang hari, tetapi setelah sore hari, sepertinya AC-nya hanya mengeluarkan angin. Saya menyetel AC ke 5 derajat Celcius saat tidur, tetapi saya masih kepanasan. Saya tidak tahu apakah AC-nya rusak atau memang seharusnya begitu."
"629.","Quinten Hoogeboom","40","2025-01-20","2","Area kolam renang luar ruangan sangat ketinggalan zaman. Hotel mengenakan biaya 100.000 IDR per orang untuk handuk dan kursi yang perlu diganti."
"630.","Til Ad","100","2019-01-20","2","Datang ke sini secara tidak sengaja. Menurut saya, tempat ini buruk. Lebih seperti Disneyland daripada hotel Bali. Tapi untuk orang-orang yang suka resor dan sebagainya, mungkin tidak masalah. Jangan ke sana kalau ingin merasakan pengalaman Bali yang autentik."
"631.","Christopher Marinko","128","2018-01-20","2","Kami pergi ke Bamboo Bar & Lounge untuk happy hour. Kami memesan dua sangria dan beberapa hidangan utama. Minumannya lumayan, buahnya kurang segar, tetapi minumannya mengandung alkohol. Namun, yang paling mengecewakan adalah makanannya, nachos dan udang kelapa. Makanannya hambar, tidak menarik, dan sangat sederhana. Harga minumannya Rp100.000. Harga makanannya kurang lebih sama. Saya tidak akan kembali ke sana untuk makan karena ada banyak tempat bagus yang menyajikan makanan lezat dan orisinal di kedua sisi Bamboo Bar. Dua bintang untuk lokasi dan penyanyi jazz live-nya, dia luar biasa."
"632.","23 derby milanadia","3","2024-01-20","2","Kami memesan hotel pada tanggal 4 Februari untuk paket Nyepi dan mendapatkan kamar dengan pemandangan kolam renang atau pantai, tetapi ada sedikit drama saat proses check-in. Kami datang pukul 1 siang ke resepsionis dan mendapatkan kertas dengan nomor kamar 21* atas nama saya,,, dan mereka meminta kami menunggu sementara kamar disiapkan... tetapi setelah menunggu selama satu jam kami tidak mendapatkan kabar apa pun dan kami bertanya lagi dan secara dramatis mereka mengubah nomor kamar dari 21* menjadi 25* tanpa alasan yang jelas dan mereka mengatakan kamar masih belum siap, dan yang membuat saya marah adalah tamu lain yang datang setelah kami mendapatkan kamar mereka lebih dulu, itu pengalaman yang sangat buruk.. dan akhirnya kami mendapatkan kamar kami setelah menunggu selama 2 jam dan mendapatkan kamar di sudut dengan pemandangan lapangan tenis yang kotor... namun sarapannya enak."
"633.","有馬惠子","133","2021-01-20","2","Akibat pandemi COVID-19, hampir tidak ada pengunjung. Dengan hanya sedikit wisatawan, daerah ini sepi dan sunyi. Pemandangan Bali sebagai destinasi wisata kini telah hilang sepenuhnya, dan terasa cukup sepi."
"634.","Jess Wood","38","2019-01-20","2","Fasilitas di pantai kurang memadai. Harus ke bar beberapa kali untuk mendapatkan koktail yang biasa-biasa saja dan harganya terlalu mahal. Sepertinya mereka kekurangan staf untuk liburan."
"635.","Stefan Huettel","6","2024-01-20","2","Sayangnya, Anda tidak dapat menghubungi hotel melalui situs web. Pesan kesalahan terus muncul. Mungkin ada yang bisa menghubungi Anda dengan alamat email yang valid."
"636.","Laura Brands","181","2021-01-20","2","Letakkan saja handuk, dan orang-orang yang sudah bertahun-tahun menginap di sana akan mengira itu hotel mereka. Singkatnya, hotel yang bagus, tamu-tamunya buruk."
"637.","Andrea Paoletti","20","2018-01-20","2","Lautnya memiliki terumbu karang sehingga penuh dengan tumbuhan laut dan tidak mungkin untuk berenang."
"638.","Duncan Casey","5","2020-01-20","2","Layanan pelanggan yang buruk di meja depan dan bahkan memberikan kunci kamar saya kepada orang acak yang tidak saya kenal, tidak diberikan kartu handuk, harus mendapatkannya, kamar hotel rata-rata tidak mendapatkan ukuran tempat tidur yang kami inginkan saat dipesan"
