"1.","Evita Hadiz","571","2025-12-23","5","Marusaka Hotel is such a gem in Nusa Dua. The rooms are spacious and beautifully designed, with a comfortable bed that guarantees a good night’s sleep. I loved having both a bathtub and a shower — perfect for choosing between a long, lazy soak or a quick refreshing rinse. Another highlight is the private swimming pool shared by every 3–4 adjacent rooms, which makes it feel exclusive yet social at the same time. The hotel also has great dining options. The Bistro is perfect for casual bites, while the Gading Resto offers a more refined dining experience with delicious dishes. And just steps away, you’ll find the private beach, a serene spot to relax, swim, or simply enjoy the view. Between the facilities, the comfort, and the location, staying here was a wonderful experience — highly recommended for anyone visiting Nusa Dua."

We had an all inclusive package which was so worth every cent. We had 4 spectacular restaurants to choose from with a mixture of western and indonesian cuisine. Breakfast had so much variety with such fresh foods. Lunch and dinner could be eaten at any of the restaurants which all had an awesome menu. Over 5 days we ate at every restaurant and couldn’t fault single thing. Service, outstanding. Food, fresh and absolutely delicious. Atmosphere, very clean, so well looked after. The rooms were no different… absolutely spectacular rooms; modern, super clean, well maintained, 100/10 for the comfort and size of the beds (super king) and pillows. The bathroom very clean, well stocked with high quality products. Again, this was no surprise given the presentation of the resort. 3 pools to choose from, one that had a swim up bar and 2 diving boards was our favourite, it had music playing all day and had a great atmosphere. There was another 2 pools that was for the quieter people. All pools extremely well maintained. The hotel also backed onto the beach (no need to take the shuttle like other nusa dua resorts), which was lovely. We also booked a spa treatment on site, which again was so beautiful! I truly couldn’t fault a single thing about this resort. Every single detail was so perfect. I cannot wait until next year when I return!"
"3.","Yijun Gu","9","2025-12-23","2","Extremely disappointing stay, would not recommend! This was by far one of the most frustrating hotel experiences I have ever had. We reserved a king bed room for multiple nights, but upon arrival, the hotel attempted to provide two single beds pushed together and present it as a king bed. Even after raising this issue and changing rooms, the exact same problem occurred again. This is not acceptable and does not match the room type we booked. The first room was located at the end of a long corridor, next to a small, poorly maintained pool. The moment we entered, there was a strong chemical and renovation odor, making the room uninhabitable. We requested a room change and were required to wait a long time in the lobby before anything was arranged. The lobby and public areas were hot, humid, and lacked air conditioning, which made the extended waiting period extremely uncomfortable. Staff mentioned that someone would contact us via WhatsApp, but no communication ever came, even throughout the entire stay. The second room had a very heavy artificial fragrance, seemingly used to mask underlying issues. The smell was overpowering and caused significant nasal irritation and an allergic reaction the following morning. Once again, the bed setup was incorrect, with two single beds pushed together instead of a proper king bed. Although the hotel acknowledged that these issues were their responsibility, they still refused to offer a full refund. What followed was prolonged and exhausting communication involving hotel staff and booking agents, with inconsistent explanations and a lack of professionalism. Additionally, the resort layout feels more like an aging apartment complex rather than a luxury resort. Rooms are spread far from the lobby and require shuttle transport, which adds unnecessary inconvenience. Overall, the service, room quality, facilities, and management fell far below expectations for a hotel of this category. The property is poorly managed and does not deliver the experience it promises. If you care about comfort, health, and a smooth travel experience, I strongly suggest looking elsewhere."
"4.","ATC_ EGGW TWR","22","2025-11-30","5","An unforgettable stay at a truly luxurious and beautifully maintained hotel. We stayed in a villa, and the level of privacy is absolutely mind-blowing. Surrounded by greenery, with a spacious and spotless private pool and a scenic river-pool just behind the villas, it felt like our own little paradise. The food is fantastic, the beach is clean with plenty of sunbeds, and the resort’s three massive pools and extensive gardens still manage to feel intimate and peaceful. But what truly sets this place apart is the staff. They can accommodate any request and went above and beyond to help us organize my mother’s 70th birthday on the beach with private dining, a birthday cake, and amazing music. The duty manager and the entire team were exceptional. Highly recommend this hotel — it’s perfect in every way."
"5.","Rebecca McInerney","12","2025-12-02","5","A truly wonderful experience. We’ve just had 5 very special days at this wonderful resort and it’s been magic. An older style resort, which I love…in beautiful, clean Nusa Dua. Rooms are lovely and cleaned daily with incredible care, lovely grounds and pools. Food exceptional and cocktails great. The thing I loved most was the team of people working there. Each and every one of them were friendly, helpful and always smiling. An absolute joy. I could not fault this establishment and I thank them for an incredible stay. We will return."
"6.","vani tyagi","7","2025-12-16","5","Hi, We stayed at Merusaka for a week, and it was an exceptional experience. The resort offers outstanding pools and excellent service throughout. We were warmly welcomed by Andre at the restaurant, and he truly made our stay memorable. He provided great food recommendations, arranged for our meals to be customised to our preferences, and even shared helpful travel suggestions. As a thoughtful gesture, he also gifted us a Merusaka coaster. His hospitality stood out, and he quickly became one of our favourite staff members. Highly recommended."
"7.","Krystal C","127","2025-11-30","5","Lovely hotel, large and grand and visually stunning. It was full of people, and kids. But there were so many options for pools that it was possible to find a peaceful spot and have your own space. We had a lagoon access room and that was an amazing saving grace that we could retreat to if all else failed. Location is unreal, we’ve stayed nearby before and love this strip for so many reasons. The views, the service, the walking paths, happy hours at all the beach hotel bars, and variety of restaurants . As well as a little ‘mini Seminyak’ treat about 3 minute drive away. Nearby massage spas will pick you up for free. What’s not to love?"
"8.","Jacqui Worrall","10","2025-11-30","5","We stayed here on our holiday and couldn't be happier. The staff, the facilities, the food, the entertainment, was everything we needed for a great holiday. It's close enough to some local spots like Bali Collection, Uluwatu, GWK Cultural Park. Ubud with the monkey forest, butterfly parks, etc, is a little further out but perfectly doable as a day trip. The staff were friendly and always eager to help. The food was incredible and generous, the drinks were fabulous. We had a ball at the foam party, the cultural dance night, we enjoyed quiet days by the pool. The inclusives like the spa treatments and photo shoot were additional bonuses that really made the trip. Highly recommend for families. My kids are teenagers, but young kids will also find things to do."
"9.","Tamas","17","2025-12-09","5","Our two-week stay at Merusaka Hotel in Nusa Dua was simply wonderful. The private pool attached to our room was absolutely fantastic and made the experience even more special. The hotel’s beachfront location and the many additional pools throughout the property offer endless opportunities for comfortable, relaxing downtime. The rooms, garden areas, and restaurants were all spotless — everything truly sparkled with cleanliness. The staff were consistently kind, attentive, and always ready to help with a smile. We had an unforgettable time, and I can wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a relaxing, beautiful, and well-cared-for getaway."
"10.","Michal Novák","32","2025-11-30","5","My friend and I spent an unforgettable 7 days at MERUSAKA Nusa Dua, and we couldn't have made a better choice. The hotel is beautiful, modern, and kept spotlessly clean. ​Accommodation: We stayed in a room with direct pool access (Pool Access), which I highly recommend to everyone—it is incredibly convenient. Although the buildings are situated quite close together, the layout is designed so cleverly that we enjoyed complete privacy and peace. ​The food was a highlight in itself—absolutely fantastic. The buffet breakfasts were extensive, and for our other meals, we ordered à la carte. Everything was always fresh, perfectly seasoned, and beautifully presented. I appreciated the selection of several themed restaurants, so we never got tired of the food throughout the week. ​The Nusa Dua location is great. Apart from the beautiful hotel beach, there are plenty of opportunities for exploring and walking in the area, which we took advantage of often. I must also highlight the staff—everyone was constantly smiling, helpful, and made sure we felt completely pampered. ​If you are looking for a place to relax with perfect service, MERUSAKA is the right choice. We will definitely be back!"
"11.","Simone Hughes","12","2025-11-30","5","Can’t speak highly enough of our stay here. This is our second visit here and we have a 3rd trip booked for next May. Staff are amazing, we booked a room with ocean views which was outstanding. Food was lovely and plentiful. One thing about staying here on an all inclusive package is you’ll never go hungry. The only down side was the hotels policy of allocated smoking areas wasn’t followed up. A fair few were smoking around the pool and left cigarette butts by the sunloungers. Not very nice to see or sit around as they weren’t cleaned up by staff. Apart from that our stay was just amazing! Can’t wait for May."
"12.","Ching You Kwang Chiew","13","2025-10-30","5","Just came back from a week stay with a group of friends and their families all celebrating turning 40 and had a wonderful time. We spent most of the time in the huge resort pool with our families. The well maintained beach was just a stone's throw and you had beautiful views of the beach from the pool. The buffet breakfast every morning was incredibly extensive with many cuisines, all of which were delicious. A special shout out to the staff at the kids club who were extremely attentive and warm. Great location, right next to Bali Collection for convenience with plenty of great restaurants within walking distance - Kekeb was a particular favourite! The free photography offered was a surprise added bonus. We got some amazing family photos taken along with some wonderful group photos too. Would highly recommend Merusaka!"
"13.","Toby K","41","2025-11-30","5","We’ve just done 5 days in a pool villa at Merusaka and it was exceptional. The staff were gorgeous. So kind, helpful and willing. The resort itself, whilst showing some minor signs of its age, was overall very clean and well maintained. And the facilities were spot on! And then there was the food which was EXCEPTIONAL! Honestly, we found so many items that we could have eaten a second time, but we wanted to try different things, which were then equally as good! 10 out of 10 all round. Would highly recommend for a fabulously relaxing holiday. And big thank you to Bhagas for his exceptional service and the two staff members who looked after my wife the night she was not feeling 100%. You made our break memorable one thanks to your kindness, professionalism and service excellence."
"14.","Michael S.","35","2025-11-30","2","I am shocked by all the positive reviews. This hotel does by far not show or meet any standards of a luxury resort. As I would have to mention so many negatives - I only note the most important ones. The pool zone and breakfast area are a pure warzone - disgusting and ugly and do not ensure a calm vacation that you actually go for. In the breakfast area you may be able to eat 15% of served food without getting sick. The room air con is working but barely - and stinks horribly - that’s why they spray the rooms with perfume to try to hide the fact. I want to emphatise that I can understand that for many people - this level of quality and service is acceptable or even good. But if you truly already visited luxury resorts or mid class resorts in your life - you will be highly disappointed. Do not expect to be able to last more than 3 days here. I suggest booking only 2 nights and decide for yourself. For us - if going by money value- wed say the hotel would be fairly priced around 70$ usd for what it offers. You can get a lot better for 100-140$ at Westin, Nusa Dua Beach etc. Only bring your girlfriend here if she never actually been to a good resort - otherwise avoid."
"15.","Slavko Kocijancic","261","2025-09-30","5","Excellent hotel. Great location near the sandy beach. Nice pools. Staff is incredibly kind and professional. Fantastic breakfast. Suitable for families with kids. Most guests like to go to shops and restaurants in so called Bali collection, which we didn't like. There are good massage pearls, shops and restaurants in direction to a rather big Coco supermarket. Much more authentic and at lower prices."
"16.","Andriana Lekka","201","2025-10-30","4","A very nice hotel right by the beach at Nusa dua Bali. Big and comfortable room, nicely decorated on our arrival , with a nice welcome gift, which was a very kind gesture. Perfectly clean room with complimentary water every day. Very kind personnel always happy to help. Gardens perfectly maintained, restaurants, sun beds and beach in front of the hotel very clean. Exquisite breakfast options, you could have literaly whatever you wanted. It was our first time in a hotel that we did not have eggs or pastry for breakfast. We’ ve tried as many local and Asian dishes as we could. Everyday different freshly made dishes. Different stations for ramen, noodles, Asian dishes, sweet treats, pastry, fruits ets. Honestly you could not ask for more! We wish we could have the opportunity to stay longer or visit the spa, but the group schedule was too tight and this was not possible. Despite this we really enjoyed our stay at Merusaka and I’ve seen one of the best sunrise in my life! Thank you"
"17.","Sudeep Choudhury","16","2025-11-30","5","This hotel has been built on a large parcel of land. Therefore, it feels very spacious. It has a lot of options in terms of food. The staff is very firendly and helpful. The resort also has easy access to the beach without 200-300 metres. The rooms were spacious and very clean. We thorughly enjoyed our stay there. Will surely recommend this to others as well."
"18.","toto titi","3","2025-11-30","5","I have stayed many times at Merusaka Nusa Dua, and it remains in my personal opinion my favourite hotel not only in Bali but in the entire world. Located on the most preserved and quiet part of the island with amazing sunrises, it is the only hotel in the Nusa Dua compound where you can swim all day long without worrying about the tides. It has an incredible beach including water sport activities, several swimming pools, a beautiful path along the sea to either run, walk or do biking. It is also the only one in the Nusa Dua compounds whose facilities (restaurants, bars and swimming pools) are facing the sea without obstructions. It has different types of bedrooms and villas to choose from so it can accommodate all type of clients’ needs and tastes including the business-oriented clientele as they have ideal conference facilities and very qualified staff (please ask for Mr Made Yuliarta) to organise meetings and evening receptions. The many restaurants and bars offer tasteful food and beverages and if you want you can choose the option of the all-inclusive stay. But my favourite part of this hotel is the service. They really have an exceptional staff who not only is extremely friendly but above all so highly qualified. Throughout your stay, their main goal will be to constantly make you feel very special and answer all your requirements for you to have the most wonderful stay. A special thanks to Pitri, Yohana, Charline, Adi, Andre, Lidia, Sudarmini Fendik, Putu, Tedi, Trisna and Agung. If you want to have an ideal holiday in Bali, I recommend without hesitation making your booking at Merusaka Nusa Dua."
"19.","snakes","73","2025-11-30","5","Super big luxury resort set within beautiful grounds close to the sea. The rooms were spotless and huge and the staff were warm and friendly. Nusa Dua being a tourist resort is not like the real Bali. The hotel is set within a huge gated complex that houses many big hotels. It could be anywhere in the World. Also not enough dogs on the beach. It is also a big shame that there is so much trash in the sea. Much is from the daily offerings (canang sari) lots of which have food items that are wrapped in plastic and also much from inconsiderate tourists. The hotel was great though and we are glad to experience a stay there."
"20.","Paul De Leon","6","2025-09-30","3","Stayed for 4d 3n. The staff were great. Very accommodating, always happy to help. The room was spacious, though we felt like it needed a bit more lighting. Yes you could always open the curtains during daytime, but at night, a bit more light would be great. No remote for the air conditioning, so you need to get up from your bed if you want to adjust the temperature. Not sure if this is the case in all other rooms. Breakfast was good. Had variety, and some cuisines are changed day to day. Didn't get to try the other restaurants within the resort as we went to other restos in the area. Unfortunately, the beach was dirty. Trash along the shoreline, and on the water as well. So much so, that people walk a few meters away just to take a dip somewhere with less stuff floating in the water. I was really looking forward to go for a swim in the Indian Ocean, so this was a bit of a letdown. We settled for the pools instead, which were clean and big."
"21.","Lodovica Colantoni","1","2025-12-23","2","Stunning location but several major problems: 1. unreasonably strict restaurant hours and no warning about that. We went to dinner at 8 p.m and they didn’t even let us get a bottle of water. 2. very bad service that ruined our holiday! AND NOT A SINGLE EMPLOYE SPEAKS ENGLISH. At the very end of our stay we forgot a picture about 1 meter long on our bed and we asked the employees to check for it, showing also a picture of the object and its placement. We had photos documenting it, the picture was there and it was not taken before leaving and I don’t know if either they didn’t want to spend time checking (which by the way it’s part of theire job) or they ruined/took it by making the bed. We had to wait hours to have an answer, asking every minute. They lost it. But the very scandalous thing is that we had to spend over an hour trying to explain our issues, since no one of theire employees (even the ones who work in costumer service) spoke a word in English. I’m sorry but that’s not what i expected at all from a 5 stars resort."
"22.","Sundara Nyoman","6","2025-12-16","5","Hotel yang nyaman,luas dan bersih. Fasilitas hotel lengkap,gym kolam renang,spa dan view pantai yg indah. Sarapannya enak dan banyak pilihan. Pelayanan dan staf yg sangat ramah. Cocok untuk liburan keluarga. Terimakasih untuk kue ulang tahunnya 12/12🙏 Sukses selalu merusaka nusa 2."
"23.","Chyntia Poedjokerto","19","2025-12-23","5","Amazing service. The staff were friendly and attentive, even during the crowded breakfast buffet. They were quick, responsive, and well organized. Every staff member clearly knew their role and worked with purpose. It was impressive to watch how smoothly they handled everything."
"24.","Kamil June","91","2025-11-30","3","This place left me… honestly kinda speechless. The hotel grounds, facilities, and greenery are great — no complaints there. But the rooms? Oof. Way too old and tired. My first night, the shower was broken: I couldn’t adjust the temperature and the water pressure was basically a drizzle. I had to run in and out of the bathroom trying to fix it, slipped, and almost smashed my head. The bathroom floor is ridiculously slippery — barefoot feels like playing “Don’t Die Challenge.” And there’s zero warning signs. Also, there’s no power outlet by the bed. I literally had to unplug the lamp to charge my phone. 😂 They moved me to a second room — the shower finally worked, but then the sink drain didn’t. And the room had this… smell. I stayed four days, the smell stayed four days. Housekeeping is meh. Breakfast looks huge with tons of choices, but honestly, not much actually tastes good. To be fair: location is solid, staff are lovely, and the pool area is pretty nice. But for a personal trip? Or if you care about room quality? I wouldn’t stay here."
"25.","Matthew Nadell","11","2025-11-30","2","We stayed here for 4 nights on our honeymoon. From the moment we checked in we felt like ghosts at the hotel. Not one person said happy honeymoon, tried to give us any sort of upgrade, and stuck us in the VERY back of the hotel with the longest walk possible. The hotel buildings are deteriorating and the overall hotel is max 3-star at best. Food at the hotel restaurant was not good, expensive, and super disappointing. Our driver mentioned that Nusa Dua area is known for super high class hotels which made our stay even more frustrating. Our clothes smelled like mold from the room. Beware of any outdoor space, including the beach and pool areas for heavy smokers making the place reek and killing the fresh air. Would NOT recommend."
"26.","Stephen","21","2025-11-30","1","Overpriced, Outdated, and Utterly Underwhelming: A Warning to Luxury Seekers ​From the moment we arrived, this resort announced itself as dated and in desperate need of attention. What was presented as an exclusive, romantic escape felt instantly compromised. The open-air check-in was a precursor to the disappointing service and facilities that followed. ​Despite booking one of the property's premium villas (at over $8.8 million IDR per night), the treatment we received was no different than that for a standard room. We arrived just one hour before the official check-in time and were flat-out refused access to our all-inclusive benefits. This is baffling and unacceptable, especially considering the rate and the fact that we were leaving early (8 am departure) and have access to a 3 pm late check-out. The lack of goodwill for a high-paying guest sets a terrible precedent. ​The Villa: Tiny, Tired, and Totally Misrepresented ​The luxury villa itself was a colossal disappointment. It was tired, and clearly in need of a renovation. For a resort charging this much, having no indoor seated area with air conditioning is simply a failure. The open-air only bathroom was yet another sign of the room’s age and poor upkeep. The amenities were equally insulting: the fridge was warm, and the all-inclusive promise amounted to just four included drinks per day in room with zero room service options. ​The All-Inclusive Scam ​The most egregious offense, however, lies in the all-inclusive package. We usually stay at Melia—which, at the same price point, is in a different universe of luxury—and this resort doesn't even come close to comparison. Upon arrival, we were told by reception that the all-inclusive covers only local spirits and alcohol. We quickly discovered this doesn't even include Bintang, the local beer of choice, which is an additional charge. Imagine the incredulity of being in Bali, on an all-inclusive plan, and having to pay extra for a Bintang! ​To anyone seeking a genuine, romantic luxury escape in Bali, I offer this sincere advice: give this resort a wide berth. It is totally oversold, severely underwhelming, and a misuse of money in such an amazing location."
"27.","Richard C","3","2025-08-30","5","The Hotel was outstanding overall. All the staff were friendly, courteous and helpful with all enquires handled promptly. The Hotel facilities were top class from the pools and beach to the restaurants and spa. The hotel property itself was peaceful and expansive. The room was clean, neat and comfortable with excellent air conditioning. We especially enjoyed the breakfast buffet each morning as we were spoilt for choice. Bali collection is nearby and accessible via a short walk or free hotel transport to and from the site. We had a wonderful stay and look forward to returning in the future."
"28.","Bayan Alyarubi","9","2025-07-30","3","We stayed at this resort for our honeymoon recently and overall, it’s a beautiful and relaxing place. The villa design blends luxury with nature, and the service team was very welcoming. Breakfast was also delicious with a good variety of options. However, as Muslims, we had a very uncomfortable experience. The bathroom is partially open to nature (as shown in the photo), which initially seemed charming. But unfortunately, while I was showering, a maintenance staff member saw me from above twice. This was extremely upsetting and made us feel that the villa lacks essential privacy. The hotel staff did apologize, and we appreciate their response, but this issue should be taken more seriously, especially for guests who value privacy for cultural or religious reasons. If you’re considering this hotel, I’d recommend double-checking the villa layout for privacy concerns. A beautiful place,but unfortunately, not private enough for us."
"29.","Tania Maxwell","13","2025-10-30","4","My Now Husband and I were Lucky enough to stay at Merusaka for 5 days, Fifth Day we got married at this amazing venue. Made the Events Manager was amazing, when I had a querie or concern it was attended to immediately. Food selected for our Reception was Amazing and was the talk of our guests. We had a Pool Access Room which was Lovely unfortunately it had an unpleasant smell first day which the staff quickly rectified. Breakfast which was included had a wide variety to choice from."
"30.","Francesco Xodo","874","2025-09-30","5","I stayed 4 nights in this stunning resort in Nusa Dua. The reception itself is a wonderful wooden building, open on 3 sides, allowing a view on the surroundings. There are 4 restaurants, a big swimming pool, a private beach with sunbeds and sun umbrellas, a gym, a spa and even a wedding chapel: you could easily spend your entire day here without getting bored. The room was simple but nice and very spacious: the only negative point was that sometimes a bad smell came from the bathroom. The staff was super friendly and very helpful. Overall a great place to stay in Bali."

The hotel is spotlessly clean, the food is amazing (we were in HB and tried the four restaurants) but the best thing here is the staff! Everyone from reception to housekeeping, F&B staff, SPA staff (if you come you need to try the Balinese massage). Well done Merusaka Team! We will recommend it and come back for sure 😊."
"33.","Bill Peppas","589","2025-09-30","5","If you're looking for a hotel/resort that is awesome in terms of inclusiveness, great location, good services, plenty of restaurants to choose from, various facilities and great breakfast, Merusaka Nusa Dua should be in your go-to list! The rooms are all spacious and well maintained, the air conditioning is efficient and relatively quiet during operation, the facilities are well maintained with small exceptions, and whenever something occurred it was taken care of promptly and efficiently in a professional manner. The cleaning staff did a great job daily. The breakfast offered is rich in choices and very good in terms of quality, quantity and taste. The pools are pretty big, deep enough, and at a great location. Next to the hotel is a relatively quiet, semi-decent beach, and there's the Bali Collection at foot travel distance with shops and luxurious restaurants. The Nusa Dua city center is also very close. The personnel at the facilities was very friendly and always offered to help in any scenario. Most of the food we tried at the on-location restaurants was at the very least decent, with some of them being awesome :) The pricing is very good for the location and amenities and services on offer. Good job Merusaka staff!"
"34.","Rik C","139","2025-08-30","5","Excellent service. Staff is courteous and prompt to respond! The rooms are ample but the bathroom could use a second sink. The beach and pools are amazing but do NOT test the undertow directly in front of the property. Go up or down the beach until you see YELLOW flags. Don't be THAT tourist because no one's coming for you without a jetski and one is NOT stationed in that area :("
"35.","Leo L","65","2025-11-30","4","Our first stop in Bali was here. It had a kermess with small shops where we could buy some local handicrafts. The staff was friendly and welcoming. The breakfast was decent, but the highlight of our visit was renting bikes and cycling through the hotels and groves. The only minor downside was a musty smell in our room, which we suspect was coming from the old AC equipment."
"36.","Kostas Katsafaros","3","2025-12-09","5","Stayed at the hotel for the first 3 days of our honeymoon. Everything was perfect! The premises, the food the hospitality… this place is a must if you visit Bali!"
"37.","Alexandre Ventura","2","2025-08-30","5","I had an amazing stay! Everything was perfect — I stayed in a villa with a private pool, and besides all the benefits of the villa itself, the hotel was exceptionally clean and well-organized. The restaurants were also excellent, offering great food and service. It was also close to the beach, and although there was quite a bit of debris and seaweed, there was at least one cleaning every day, which was much appreciated. Highly recommended!"
"38.","Chanelle","13","2025-09-30","5","This resort was a dream. It was the first time in a holiday where I actively wanted to stay in the vicinity for the entirety of my stay. The pools, location, beach were delightful and contributed to a beautiful holiday for my family, partner and I. Breakfast served an array of options: the service from the staff was outstanding, and everyone was attentive and friendly. What I enjoyed about breakfast was the fact that staff brought coffees and juice to your table which was really nice for a buffet scene. The food for lunch and dinner was also lovely, and the drinks were delicious. What I *wish* I had done was explore more of Nusa Dua and try some of the restaurants on the outskirts; it is only a five minute walk to a beautiful complex of markets and restaurants and the food was outstanding. However, it is just so gorgeous at the Merusaka that it is so hard to leave! *Warning* be mindful when doing your laundry here, it is extremely expensive in comparison to getting it done down the road. But there is accountability on my side for that too. My partner and I are really excited to come back to the Merusaka one day."
"39.","Kim Maricchiolo","14","2025-06-30","5","We just got back from a fantastic holiday. The resort itself is absolutely stunning, there are people cleaning and maintaining it every day. The pools are beautiful and there is something for everyone, if you just want to chill out or you want to have fun or enjoy a drink at the swim up bar. The rooms are lovely and clean, and well maintained every day. I loved having a lovely tub to treat myself to a nice long soak. The restaurants were great, something for everyone. The service was second to none, everyone was so sweet kind and helpful, they couldn't do enough for you. The Balinese are wonderful when it comes to customer service, they are so hard working, it puts Australia to shame. I would have no issue recommending the Merusaka to anyone looking for a fantastic holiday and personally will definitely be coming back."

Only negative was I spoke with hotel staff about being upgraded as I had brought my whole family 6 rooms and they didn’t even through in club benefits."
"41.","Christine Cherry","51","2025-08-30","5","Excellent resort, fantastic service and wonderful staff. Can’t fault anything. However the floor of the room showers were slippery and we asked for a non slip mat which was promptly provided. Also only 1 pool had a hand rail making it extremely hard to get out of the pools. Very satisfied with food etc"

It has a calm environment ideal for couples, the rooms are very spacious, breakfast is a combination of local and international cuisine and the staff is as friendly and attendant as every single Balinese we met. Overall, an excellent hotel with very good vibes."

"44.","jemma carney","10","2025-07-30","1","Despite being the most expensive of the three hotels we stayed at during our trip to Bali, this large resort was our least favorite. The daily struggle to secure a lounge chair by the pool was frustrating, as guests would reserve them with towels early in the morning, and this issue was not addressed by the staff. This problem persisted throughout the day. Although the beach appeared attractive at first glance, the ocean was littered with debris. On our first day, our friend's daughter unfortunately stepped on a condom while walking on the sand. This incident deterred us from visiting the beach for the remainder of our stay. Additionally, we felt that there was an insufficient number of staff to adequately service the guests. Lunch plates and drink glasses were not regularly collected, and pool towels ran out on two of the five days we were there before being replenished. The resort featured four restaurants, but the menu choices were average and quite similar. Despite being on an all-inclusive plan, some dishes incurred additional surcharges. Given the hotel's location, we expected more entertainment options for guests beyond a couple of singers performing during dinner. After five nights, we were not only bored but also tired of the food. On our last night, three desserts on the menu at the restaurant below the main lobby were unavailable. Our room was pleasant, but it had only one hook for a towel, and the selection in the inclusive mini bar was quite ordinary. There was also no drawer in the room, which we found to be a design flaw. The sofa was uncomfortable as well. We paid extra for a room with direct pool access, but we only used it once and felt it was not worth the additional cost. On a positive note, the staff were friendly."
"45.","Wolfgang Motz","28","2025-08-30","5","Great value for money and a top location in Nusa Dua. The beach is great and the resort offers loads of pool and beach options. Rooms are spacious, maybe a bit dated but still good. Beds are super comfy. Would definitely go there again!"
"46.","Russ The Muss","16","2025-09-30","5","We stayed in one of the Villas recently for 8 nights. The room was fantastic, very private and quiet. The staff were so helpful often going the extra mile to make sure our stay was incredible. The staff also enjoyed making conversation with us and suggesting locations/ attractions to visit."
"47.","KFHarg","48","2025-08-30","3","Pros * The main pool was a beautiful temperature, and I enjoyed swimming whenever there was a break in the dive-bombing and cannonballs. * If you’re up early and choose your spot strategically, you *might* enjoy a peaceful poolside day — though this was unpredictable and very much dependent on the guests that day. * We loved having direct beach access and enjoyed late afternoon walks along the sand. * Housekeeping were great and kindly returned a missing Kindle after our room change. The maintenance team were genuinely friendly, helping us open bottles when we could not find a corkscrew. Cons * The hotel has several pools (three main ones, two shallow ones, and a separate pool with diving boards), but none are adults only. A calm swim or quiet time is a challenge with children running, shouting, and dive bombing. It would be helpful if the staff contained the chaos to the pool that has diving boards. * There don’t seem to be enough sun loungers for the number of guests. We often saw people wandering around looking for a spot, and beds “reserved” with towels but left empty for half a day. Staff didn’t appear to have a system in place to manage this, despite recent responses to reviews that they have implemented a process. * Breakfast was a free-for-all and felt like a survival game. It could be a science experiment on social and cultural anthropology. Barista coffee was a 20-minute wait, while the self-serve machines had long queues and frequently lacked cups or milk. Basics such as yoghurt were consistently unavailable. * Check-in took about 30 minutes, which wouldn’t have been an issue if there had been some kind of welcome or explanation — instead, we just sat waiting in silence while the receptionist typed intensely. * I emailed twice before arrival, politely asking for a nice room within our booked category as we were celebrating a special occasion. What we received was not that - the room didn’t resemble the photos or expectations. After some persistence, we were moved to a far better one within our category, but it wasn’t the welcome we’d hoped for. * While Bali is known for its warmth and hospitality, many of the front-of-house staff (especially at reception and in the restaurant) seemed overwhelmed and gave the impression that guests were an inconvenience. * Do not go to the pool-side bathrooms. Turn around and walk back to your room. * Our “king” bed was two singles pushed together. This was not a big deal for us, but worth noting if that’s something that would bother you. Simple Suggestions * Designate one pool as an adults only pool, or contain the shouting, running and dive-bombing. * Implement a policy to reset reserved sun-beds. There was no evidence this occurred, despite recent responses to reviews. * Consider extending the breakfast service hours or make use of the other restaurant spaces to alleviate the crush and relieve the staff. * Train front-of-house staff with a focus on personalised customer service and first impressions. * Clean the pool-side bathroom every hour. I am hoping for a response to my review. Suksma."

"51.","Ashwin Pandit (Ashwin)","9","2025-09-30","5","Excellent accommodation with walking distance to Bali Collection. The rooms are clean & serviced throughly. The staff is attentive & excellent. Especially Sutin, our breakfast maitre d', she was super attentive and very well spoken. All the restaurants in the hotel serve great meals and all inclusive package have a lot of choices on offer. The sun lounges on the beach end is attended well, though can be a struggle to find a sun lounge if you don't get to the pool on time. Busy hotel but they have more than enough staff to service people. Not once we found anything out of place."
"52.","Margaret Jewell","7","2025-07-30","5","A great place to stay but it is vast and family oriented so expect lots of people. It is so big that nothing feels too crowded but you do have to be up early to get your place on the beach sunbeds! Lovely gardens. We had a room with a pool outside our balcony which was wonderfully tranquil. Plenty of restaurants and a short walk to many more nearby."
"53.","Kate Pearson","3","2025-07-30","4","Very much enjoyed our stay as a group of 8. Hotel accommodates requests for interconnect and near to each other. A huge hotel, bit of walking to get up and out of the accommodation area. For us unfortunately the lack of food choices was dissapointing, not so much for breakfast but lunch and dinner. And lack lustre on some of the dishes we had. They could do with a bit more staff to ensure meals come out hot and quickly and efficiently. The hotel was very busy due to the holidays. Towels left on loungers could be enforced a bit more during these times."
"54.","Daisy Jo Bear","11","2025-07-30","5","Just spent 7 nights here with two teens. We upgraded to the pool access room. I really can’t fault the whole place. The food is good, service is great and the beach club with the jumping boards were hours of entertainment. We were all inclusive and it was excellent value. Very happy with the whole place."
"55.","Lynn Jardine","12","2025-06-30","5","Perfect relaxing resort, food and rooms were all excellent with second to none service. We had a Deluxe pool access room which we highly recommend. Every member of staff went above and beyond our expectations, thank you all. We were celebrating a birthday and wedding anniversary and received lovely cakes for both. We enjoyed a floating breakfast on our anniversary (extra charge - well worth the cost). Our air conditioning wasn’t working one night and was fixed within half an hour and we were offered another room until the problem was resolved. We will definitely return again without a doubt, can’t wait, see you next time Merusaka."

"57.","Ashley Warner","1","2025-07-30","5","(If they allowed .5 stars I would mark service as 4.5) Had a lovely time at Merusaka, had an all inclusive package, lagoon pool attached to my room, everything was great at the resort and in the room. Would have been better if in room dining was included in the all inclusive option (I knew this going into my stay, just would have made the stay a little bit better especially after long days out). Had friends staying at the same time but arrived separately but were given more general information during their stay without needing to ask or extra information when asking a general question. i.e activities on offer at the resort during their stay, outside shuttle services, tour of their room and offerings available in the room. Was able to get the information second hand which was good but would recommend that this is given to all guests on arrival or when making enquires. Would recommend to everyone to stay here as you had inclusive options if needed, multiple different room options, close to markets and Bali Collection shops, near the beach, great restaurants, amazing different pool options around the resort and good up to date facilities. Just a note for possible guests there are a lot of stairs to get to the lobby/facilities/restaurants from your rooms so just a note if you need accessibility, there are ramps but some are steep. You could call for a buggy/golf cart ride if they are available but just so you are aware."
"58.","Janet Ng","54","2025-08-30","4","We had an enjoyable stay at the resort. My kids loved jumping in the big swimming pool. There are three swimming pools, each with lounge beds for people to relax by the water. However, the food served at the swimming pool could be improved."

"60.","Sue R","9","2025-08-30","3","I loved the package but we had a couple of issues. Firstly, we paid extra for a deluxe pool twin room. We couldn’t use the pool as the pool rail was very loose and would have come off. Secondly, my friend and I organised an extension when we arrived, as we were flying out at midnight. We stated over a dozen times that we wanted the package extended. We continued to repeat that we have the package so we will not be paying for anything. He confirmed and also gave a good deal as we were not having breakfast the next day. Our flight was cancelled due to volcano so we had to stay the night in any case. But our package was cancelled after lunch and when we complained they showed the paper that I had signed and the word ““without” included package” looked like it had been added and was slightly different pen and looked like it had just been written. They wouldn’t do anything. They told us that as we had extended that we had the room until midday the following day in any case, so so much for the great deal the guy gave us. I did enjoy it apart from those hiccups, but there are a lot of very nice looking resorts nearby."
"61.","Andrew and Fulvia Rogers","1","2025-07-30","5","We really enjoyed our 9 days holiday at Merusaka Nusa Dua. Our room was very spacious and clean. The staff were amazing: genuinely friendly and always attentive. The breakfast buffet offered many different choices and the four restaurants were good. Lovely well-maintained garden. Nice pools. The beach is also nice and there is a paved path ideal for long walks or for jogging."
"62.","Sathvik Reddy","5","2025-12-23","1","I forgot my keys and they made me and my wife wait half an hour in the humid and mosquito ridden outdoors before someone opened the door. There is no proper communication between the staff. I asked the guy at the gate to call the lobby so that someone can open the door when I am at my room but no one came. Then I called the lobby using phone number on Google, yet no one came, I called again, still no one came. I was walking to the lobby when a hotel staff on buggy said he came to pick me up, when I reached the lobby, my wife called me to say that someone came to open the door, so much confusion for such a silly thing. I wouldn’t consider staying here neither would I recommend it to anyone."
"63.","Toni Froia Drummond","164","2025-08-30","5","A lovely stay at this resort. Plenty of options for swimming several pools and seating available.

Plenty of food options as well. Morning and night market stalls at the resort. Room service is great. Very clean."
"64.","Karen Lambert","73","2025-08-30","5","We have had the boat Amazing week with you… such a beautiful place and we have loved our all inclusive package! What we like best was the fact each restaurant served specific meals and it wasn’t all buffet style - this made it feel very good and 5*! The breakfast buffet was great- with the best omelettes freshly made! Lovely ramen freshly made too- and then amazing fruits and pastries as well as traditional Indonesian sweet and savoury foods- pool bar is the best! Right on the edge of the sea- huge waves in our bay, and lots of surfing! The sea sadly has pockets of rubbish which they try to clear but we then see more- not from the resort but all over- if you go out a bit you get away from it. The spa is very popular so we couldn’t get in, it looked lovely! The gym was great-my husband used it every day-various items to use including treadmills and weights! We were in Puri (palace) 1 with 3 rooms in the bottom with a shared pool! It was brilliant and actually having had private pools, it Was great to swim with our kids! The rooms were down a long walkway and at breakfast and in the evening lots of market trades were set up, providing a safe/non-confrontational way to barter for some local wares.they were always willing to knock the prices down - a sarong for 120,000 (£5) and bar clips for 30000 (£1:20) Lovely walk from the beach past Hyatt to the Water blow at the top of the beach- with a huge temple (25000) to get in per adult - about £1! Well worth a walk and look! Felt very safe here it’s if security and staff very attentive! Look out for the squirrels! If you aren’t all inclusive restaurants serve you and you pay- or take the hotel shuttle to Bali Collection- lots of shops and restaurants… even a small market out the back. We also did a silver class here-taxi took 10 mins to Nusa Dia silver class-£65 (1,300000) fir 2 hour class and you keep the ring you designed-excellent trip! We have loved Bali and would love to come back one day-lovely people/weather/food - a little bit of heaven"
"65.","Radek Sklenář","14","2025-09-30","3","I have very mix feelings. This hotel is on prime location with a beautiful beach but that is all. It claims to be 5* hotel but as it is very old hotel it looks and feels more like 3*. The worst part is that it is really overpriced but somehow full in capacity and tourists. Our sleep was not good as there is almost no soundproof isolation as you can hear your neighbour walking, taking shower etc."
"66.","Michael Papa","191","2025-09-30","5","Omg, cannot fault this place. ALL staff were amazing. Concierge service was if only we existed. All inclusive food and drinks package did not meant watered down food choices or drink quality! The food was 5 star and the wait staff's efforts were as good as if we went to a local non prepaid 5 star restaurant. Cocktails included as many as you like! Spotless cleanliness and the private pool access room is a must if you come here as it was one of the highlights for us! Cannot fault Merusaka and walking along the Beach passing by many other 5 star resorts proved that Merusaka was by far the liveliest buzz and fun atmosphere! Was relaxing and unlike the commercial annoying vibe of well known less private parts of Bali that I've been told about. If I could post more stars I would!"
"67.","Justin","17","2025-09-30","2","In a nutshell, big sprawling hotel next to dirty litter strewn beach, tired rooms with patched up paintwork and scratched, chipped woodwork, noisy air con.

"68.","Lisa","10","2025-09-30","5","Stayed 3 nights and had a great experience at this hotel. Not only the staffs are friendly, they are so professional. Whatever time you need assistance they will likely assist you in a very good manner. As a mom with an under 1yo baby this helps a lot especially even after midnight calls they are so responsive and fast!! The view is beautiful so peaceful i enjoy everycorner of the hotel as well. Breakfast full of variety, always came back with a happy tummy, although i wish the baby chair could be cleaned cause everytime i asked for one it’s always dirty. I’d like to also highlight my favourite guy bli Anom at gading restaurant as he was the only one who offered my baby a freshly made puree. Very friendly, fun guy, even though we talked only once but the next day he remembered me and asked my family’s wellbeing again. Planning to go back here next year for a longer stay! :))"

"72.","Manish Kapoor","10","2025-07-30","1","The resort itself is beautiful and the service was generally very good. However, I had a disappointing experience that future guests should be aware of. Before leaving for sightseeing, I placed my watch and earbuds carefully next to each other in the room. When I returned, the earbuds were missing. I’m absolutely sure of how I left them. This experience has made me question how well the staff are trained when it comes to handling guests’ belongings. I strongly advise future visitors to lock up all valuables, even if you're just stepping out for a short time. It’s unfortunate, because otherwise the stay was enjoyable."
"73.","Harpreet Bedi","7","2025-10-30","1","I’m writing this with so much disappointment and worry. We took our son to the hotel’s pool party, thinking it would be a fun family day — but it turned into a nightmare. While enjoying pool party he complained stings on his face . We took him out and after he showered we noticed my little boy’s face broke out in red, itchy rashes on his cheeks under and top of his eyes too . . He was crying and so uncomfortable, and as a parent, it’s heartbreaking to see your child in pain from something that should’ve been safe. When I complained they told me it never happened before but pretty sure it may be wrongly diluted .Not happy have to cancel all the plans we made ."
"74.","Cami M","16","2025-07-30","5","We had a fantastic stay at Merusaka Nusa Dua last week and were especially impressed by a few standout features. First: the pools! For the first time in years of visiting Bali around this time, we found a resort where the pools were actually warm. Both the large main pools and the smaller pool directly accessed from our room were warm - a very welcome change compared to the icy experiences we’ve had at Sofitel and Mulia in previous years. The service across the resort was warm and genuinely friendly. A special thanks to Charline at Gading Restaurant - she was an absolute delight and made our mornings even more pleasant. As vegans, we often brace ourselves for limited or repetitive food options, but Merusaka went above and beyond. Management and staff made a real effort to accommodate us - inviting us to pre-order custom breakfast dishes, surprising us daily with vegan desserts, and even sending a beautifully wrapped vegan banana bread to our room for our birthdays. It made us feel truly seen and cared for. The buffet breakfast also had clear labelling and offered plenty of vegan options each day, which we really appreciated. Gading and Homaya restaurants had plenty of dishes that were either vegan by default or could be tweaked slightly to become vegan. We had the all-inclusive package, which was well worth it and made the experience feel even more relaxed. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a beautiful and genuinely welcoming stay - and a special shout-out to fellow vegans: Merusaka knows how to look after you!"
"75.","Nicholas Chronopoulos","100","2025-08-30","5","Luxury hotel. Extremely spacious room with sofa and bathroom with bathtub apart from shower. Breakfast is overwhelming. From traditional English to Indonesian to Japanese to whatever your heart desires. The whole area is secluded and hosts a series of luxury hotels with security checks on entry and exit. Only drawback, due to heavy traffic, is that it is located moderately to quite far away from a lot of the places you will be visiting. A word to the management though: the staff at the beach should enforce the half our rule regarding the hogging of the sunbeds because there are quite a lot of people that regard themselves as clever and lay a towel and leave for a couple or more hours."

Got my room, and found out that the bidet was danage and they have to replaced it.

"89.","Graham Shay","8","2025-06-30","4","We stayed 10 nights with a family of 9 in 3 rooms. The staff were so helpful, friendly and always courteous. Rooms were always clean and tidy. For this length of time, ordinarily we would completely unpacked instead of living out of a suitcase but as there were no drawers in the rooms so this could not be achieved. My wife is gluten free and the only restaurant that really didn’t cater for us was the Ja Jan bistro. We had the all inclusive, with 2 x 12 year olds and 1 x 13 year old having to pay as adults which I know is the same as most of the resorts which is so wrong. We ended up getting a late checkout as our flights didn’t leave till 11:30 pm. We had to pay for an extra 1/2 day which wasn’t a problem but our all inclusive cut off at 12:00 midday. We have been to a few other Nusa Dua resorts and we were always covered with all inclusive until we left. I understand this is Merusakas policy but a few hours of all inclusive is a way to get people taking about your resort as you don’t take not consideration the check in time people arrive as their all inclusive starts at 2:00 pm and you may not arrive till the evening. Your employees at the main pool and the all day dining restaurant were fantastic. More evening shows for all your guests, not just the special ones that you pay extra for, would be hi lights for people and that will also get people talking about your resort. Push bikes should be able to use without having to pay on an all inclusive package. Just a few suggestions. Al in all our family had a great time at your resort."

"92.","Bally Dhillon","72","2025-05-30","3","3/5 – Mixed Experience, Room for Improvement We stayed for 4 days and 3 nights, booking two pool access rooms. Upon check-in, we discovered that only one room had a king-sized bed, while the other had two singles pushed together—apparently no other rooms were available. The receptionist seemed to be having a rough day and didn’t greet us warmly, though that’s understandable. Once in the room, the air conditioning wasn’t functioning properly and required two visits from maintenance. The mattress was clearly old and not comfortable, making sleep difficult. We also had to request for the pool to be cleaned, which was disappointing considering it was a pool access room. On a more positive note, room service was decent, the breakfast staff were excellent, and the restaurants on the property were truly impressive. The beach was beautiful and added a lot of value to our stay. With some attention to room maintenance and staff training at reception, this could be a much better experience."

A special mention goes to the wedding organiser Gita, who went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly on our special day – nothing was too much trouble and his attention to detail made the whole experience stress-free. We are so grateful to the team at Merusaka for making our wedding truly unforgettable. Highly recommend!"
"94.","Jay E","98","2025-06-30","4","Great location Super clean Helpful staff but almost too helpful at times, when you just want something simple. Close to Bali collection my and the strip. You can walk. Beach is beautiful but the water does still get trash but it is not their fault. Pools are great, all of them. Sun loungers people do put down and leave so you need to be early if you have specific ones in mind to use. Food at breakfast was good, with plenty of selection and was very good with my daughters allergies. The breakfast staff are amazing actually. Also the kids club staff. Great women. The kids wouldn’t leave and loved it. Kids club was so good for us and it’s close to the pool, with full glass windows and a camera. My girls loved the staff. Thank you so much to you. Doors are not sound proof. The rooms seems okay though. The shower and the wasn’t great. And the balcony we didn’t use, looked depressing. Super clean through out. I don’t like the form party around the pool bar with drunk adults, children and low visibility. Market stalls too with reasonable prices. I would stay again but for short breaks. It is a little boring with no entertainment programme. Even in the day they list it but apart from yoga you see nothing. Same with night time, beach front dining and nothing …."

"96.","Sam Steelgrave","67","2025-05-30","3","Merusaka Bali boasts a stunning beachfront location with easy access to the shore, making it a wonderful spot for those looking to relax by the ocean. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful, always ready to assist with a warm smile. However, our stay was not without its drawbacks. The beds in our room were noticeably lumpy and sunken, making sleep less comfortable than expected. Mosquitoes in the room were a persistent nuisance throughout the night, and despite attempts to manage the issue, they detracted from the overall experience. Additionally, the drainage in both the shower and sink was frustratingly slow, leading to pooling water and an inconvenience during use. The welcome fruit basket, while a nice touch, was misnamed and the fruit not ripe. The breakfast buffet was underwhelming, with a limited variety and food quality that did not meet expectations. While the location and service shine, improvements in comfort and amenities would greatly enhance the guest experience. Our experience at this hotel led us to cancel our remaining nights and rebook at a nearby alternative hotel."
"97.","Dawn Norton","5","2025-06-30","5","Great location. Resort was fully booked during stay but didn’t seem crowded. Nice staff and good service. Two weddings while we were there so be aware if you are bringing kids there may be noise until 10pm (upside - fireworks!)"
"98.","Dila Fandi","15","2025-06-30","5","My family had a wonderful time at Merusaka. Service exceeded our expectations. All staff, including the porters, receptionists, maintenance, and f&b were helpful, spoke with a smile, and their kindness shone through. When we complained abt our TV's missing audio, they replaced the whole TV with another. Rooms were well maintained. The in-room pool was clean and warm. The pools were enjoyable too. My only little complaint is the cleanliness of the beach. I feel the hotel could have done better to comb through the sand for litter and keep it pristine. Overall great stay! Thank you Merusaka!"
"99.","Alison Wigston","7","2025-09-30","5","The Merasuka was an absolute delight, the staff made us feel so welcomed and were a real highlight of our stay. We had the beautiful villa with a pool which was devine, could not recommend the resort more highly, we’ll be back!"
"100.","Nikoleta Glamuzina","12","2025-05-30","4","Honestly it’s probably 5 stars if you are into the resort type holiday and you have no dietary requirements. Otherwise I would not recommend. The facilities are good and clean and staff are lovely but that’s it. Pools and beach are overcrowded, or just the seats provided. People put their towels on them and they don’t come for 4-5 hours to sit on them but they just do it to save space. Annoying! Entitled guests are the main issue. There are zero vegan options on any menus of any of the restaurants in the resort. Very disappointing. Had to order food every time and get it delivered. They cater to general public but that’s it. The entire resort area is restricted access and you don’t even know you are in Bali. No culture exposure at all. Personally I was not a fan of that but if you are then it’s good."
"101.","Öner Bedir","128","2025-06-30","5","We stayed at Merusaka Nusa Dua in a room with a private pool — it was absolutely exceptional! The setting is beautiful, the hotel is well maintained, and the staff were all incredibly kind and cheerful, which made our stay even better. The only small downside was the bed — it was very wide but not the most comfortable for us. Other than that, everything was perfect. Thank you to the whole team for an unforgettable stay!"
"102.","M.","27","2025-04-30","3","Positive: The staff is very friendly and helpful, the service was excellent. The outside area of the hotel is nicely done and huge. Pools and beach are also nice to relax, but the sunbeds are often broken/dirty and won’t be repaired (see other reviews). Restaurants were good too. Negative: We had booked a Deluxe Room with Pool Access. The whole room needs to be renovated, especially the bathroom. The shower head was completely calcified, the water went basically everywhere but not where you want it. It made taking a shower uncomfortable. The rain shower didn’t work at all (and was also completely dirty). The light in the bathroom was poor and not bright enough. The room and its furnishing is old and you can see signs of wear everywhere. Do not expect luxury when booking this hotel, it is mass processing (especially during breakfast). I would rate this hotel max. a 4-star standard, for the price it costs I unfortunately can’t recommend it."
"103.","Ashley Goodsell","9","2025-09-30","1","2nd time being here. Definitely not as good as I remember. Service is really slow. No one asks you for anything it’s all done by QR code.

Location was great, service was amazing and the interconnecting rooms were great for our family holiday! Beds and pillows were so comfortable!!! The service provided by the staff, especially Dana & Bagas at the poolside bar. They constantly went above and beyond to ensure all guests were looked after and having a great time! All inclusive package is definitely the way to go! We will definitely be back!"
"110.","Nicole K","20","2025-05-30","4","We had a great stay and felt truly valued, especially during a birthday surprise with a complimentary cake and singing waiters at breakfast. Guest Relations was super friendly, and room decoration for just €15 was a lovely extra. The hotel is in good shape overall, with some areas due for future updates, but public spaces like the pool, beach, restaurant, and lobby are well-maintained. Direct beach access with plenty of loungers and free towel service. Breakfast has plenty of options! For all cultures and tastes! Gym also good for exercising. Staff were very friendly and service-minded — even if English wasn’t perfect. So keep that in mind. Overall: Great value and perfect beachfront location! But don’t expect a European 5-Star house."

The hospitality is outstanding and the food always delicious and the day spa is heavenly. If you are after a holiday where your biggest decision will be which pool to swim in, which cocktail to order and which restaurant to dine in - Merusaka is the resort for you. We will definitely book again."

The location is perfect — right on a beautiful, calm beach with plenty of sunbeds for everyone. The rooms are spacious, clean, and very comfortable, and the hotel grounds are stunning, with multiple pools and lush landscaping. We loved the variety of dining options and the relaxed, elegant atmosphere throughout the resort. Most of all, we were really impressed by the staff — everyone was welcoming, helpful, and genuinely kind. Thank you for a wonderful stay — we’ll absolutely be back!"
"119.","Stephen Woodward (Woody)","66","2025-06-30","5","Loved our stay here recently. Plenty of options for food and my wife is veggie and although there wasn’t much on the menu it was enough variety for a few days.

"121.","Gen B","29","2025-03-30","5","Merusaka was amazing!! The attention to detail was on another level. We only stayed for 3 days and after day 1 the staff remembered our room numbers and needs. The pools were so relaxing and had great variety. With delicious cocktails (the best we had in Bali)! The ocean access was amazing with plenty of umbrellas and lounge chairs. There were always pool/beach towels easily accessed and the staff were always so accommodating. The rooms were great sizes and were always made up fantastically. The gym was the best we've ever had while on holidays! With great variety of machinery and it was always very clean. The small market stalls were decently priced. We also enjoyed the variety of restaurants and the food was always delicious. We all loved the buffet breakfast! The in house spa was a but pricey but we made the most of the beach massages which were solid and well priced."
"122.","Kenneth Ngo","17","2025-07-30","4","Great location. 5 star hotel, 30% cheaper than Grand Hyatt next door. Rooms and facilities not as well maintained as the established brands. Restaurants and breakfast very subpar. But overall, good value for the location and 4.5 star level facilities"
"123.","Kris K","64","2025-06-30","3","There is only a few smaller things that would greatly lift the review. Firstly the bad: - Coffee at breakfast. It's rubbish. Nua K near by is 100x better. It wouldn't take much to have a proper barista coffee at breakfast. - shower water pressure is terrible. - bed quality is also terrible. You sink into the outline of a human indicating far too soft and due for replacement. - wifi and cell reception bad in the rooms - swim up bar at the beach club but with kids. Youve got kids ordering alcohol. The swim up bar should be at the adults pool The good: - great choices at breakfast and lovely omelettes with good food - superb location with beach front access and water activities - nice variety of swimming pools - spacious rooms with large bathrooms - good priced food and cocktails. Good strength alcohol - not watered down - well priced resort for our pool room. Gokd value"

"127.","Andy Yonatan","52","2025-07-30","5","Been 5 times staying in this Hotel. This time, as just two of us, we are trying to stay at the Villa, a private complex just behind all the Puri buding (the 3 storey building where the Deluxe room available). Unless you bring your own car, Villa will require you to order the buggey car as it bit far away. Although there's a way that will shortcut to restaurant building. Villa is just perfect, with a private pool, bathup, shower and complete set of amnenities and free soda. Dedicated lobby and parking area, even you can have your breakfast at villa (less preferable for me 😅) Beach is good, vibe is great, pool is awesome. A lot of pool to try plus our private one. Servive is great."
"128.","Wayan S","123","2025-06-30","4","Big resort with a private beach vibe I visited Merusaka Nusa Dua a few years ago during the IESF event. Didn’t stay in the rooms, so I can’t comment on that — but the overall vibe was really nice. The place is huge, with well-kept grounds and a layout that makes it feel a bit like your own private resort. The beach area is clean and quiet, giving that peaceful, almost exclusive feeling. Perfect if you're looking to escape the crowd. It’s definitely one of those upscale, spacious resorts — even just walking around it feels relaxing."
"129.","Matt Jackson","9","2025-07-30","5","We had a fantastic experience at Merusaka Nusa Dua. The resort is beautifully maintained with lush gardens, direct beach access, and a peaceful pool area. The rooms were spotless and thoughtfully laid out, making it easy to relax from day one. A special mention to Dwis, who greeted us with genuine warmth at check-in and was equally professional and kind at check-out. Her hospitality really stood out and made us feel truly welcomed. Highly recommend Merusaka for anyone visiting Bali – it’s the perfect blend of comfort, style, and heartfelt service."

Waited atleast 40 minutes to receive drinks and first in first out obviously doesn’t exist in this place.Communication between morning and afternoon shift is poor as we arranged a cake for a birthday dinner which was not provided and in the end was called a liar about it being arranged. I’m glad to be leaving this place tomorrow and wouldn’t recommend anyone to come."
"132.","Alice Tourlonias","20","2025-08-30","2","Worst service I have ever seen. 20 people behind the desk but only 0,5 working, the rest making jokes in front of guests. 1 hour waiting for every meal but 2 seconds to take out your plate, even if when not finished. That was just crazy. Don’t go to Merusaka nor nusa dua it is everything but Bali."
"133.","Jared Matthews","7","2025-04-30","5","We stayed in one of the villas for our honeymoon and couldn’t have been happier with our choice. We tried all restaurants and all food was fantastic. We definitely recommend the ribs from the beach restaurant or pool bar, also the lobster from there as well ($5 surcharge). The service and manners of all employees was amazing. The bed and pillows were the best we’ve ever had (sleeping for 9 hours most nights). Highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again"

If you are looking for the perfect place to unwind, relax in the sun this is it. With lots of pools and beach frontage is spectacular. The staff were all very lovely, helpful and courteous. Our room was always cleaned to a high standard. Meals were very good, and having the choice of 4 restaurants we barely left the resort. If you do want to go out there is a Complimentary shuttle to Bali Collection where you'll find shopping, restaurants, massages etc. Even though Nusa Dua is away from the hustle and bustle of Kuta it's only a cheap Taxi ride away. Highly recommended Merusaka and will be happy to stay here again"

It exceeded our expectations from the food from the 4 restaurants, the range of activities, the accommodation and the beautiful blue and clean beach.. and there were even shops/stalls on the resort. Our massages were heavenly ! The customer service from the Reservations Team and all the staff at the hotel... polite, welcoming and always went out of their way to accommodate us. We didn't step foot outside the resort except to do a day tour and to cycle around Nusa Dua. We absolutely loved our stay and would recommend it to anyone that just wants pure relaxation for a holiday !"
"139.","Karen Jankovic","36","2025-05-30","5","We stayed here 5 nights for honeymoon. Did not go to plan as husband had accident on first night, requiring urgent medical and hospital visits.

Drove us to and from hospital for 3 days, buggy so he didn't have to walk around. Meals to our room if needed, even sent flowers. Resort is truly beautiful, and caring staff made it perfect. Can not fault service or attention...will definitely come again to experience total package."

"144.","Cindy Isada","1","2025-05-30","4","We stayed for 2 nights at Merusaka to celebrate my Mum's birthday and spend the last few days in Bali chilling before we flew back home. I got us 4 deluxe rooms for 8 adults and 2 kids. The room is huge and the toilet and bath is spacious enough. I just find the lightning inside the toilet too dim for my eyes. Couldnt keep the window blinds in the T&B open all the time as we're facing another building. All looked clean. The grout/tiles by the shower glass panel just needs changing/updating. The beach isnt as crowded on a Sunday. The water is clear and the beach is satisfyingly clean. My niece's 2yr old son hated the sand and the beach murky water but he thoroughly enjoyed the beach water for the first time here. He had so much fun (still wont play in the sand) and we're very happy that he did. We went to the swimming pool after. They have an outdoor shower in very convenient location near the pool area. The pool water is warm and very nice. The infinity pool lets you enjoy the view of the beach and its surrounding. Not that deep for asian height. They have kids pool as well. Breakfast buffet was decent, lots of food to choose from. They gave my mum a complimentary birthday cake and a greeting card too. The staff sang her a bday song. The gesture made my mum really happy and teary. It would have been better if I had requested in a more private setting though. We also tried Gading Restaurant. I wish the food was as great as the staff. The food was pricy and underwhelming given the long waiting time for food to be served. We tried the outside restaurant nearby (Yasa Segara), and it was so much better (fair priced, food tastes great, and serving was one of the quickest we've had in our 10days in Bali). Biggest downside: CHECK-IN I requested for a 1 twin bed and 3 kings. However the king beds arent available and so I was offered for combined twin beds on the day of check-in, which is better as they're bigger than actual king beds. I was advised to inform them if the beds arent combined so they could make them. We got there past 3pm already so I thought we wouldn't have to wait to get to our rooms but unfortunately only 2 rooms were available, and so the guest relation officer who checked us in asked for my WhatsApp number so she can inform me when the other rooms are ready. When I got to the room no. 2, the key card wasn't working so I handed it to the bell boy and informed reception, and to also request for the beds to be combined asap. We had to stay in one room with fussy kids while waiting (we're 8 adults + 2 kids). Everyone was tired and in dire need to rest. Good thing the rooms we're waiting on are on the same floor and almost next to each other. I received a message that the other rooms are ready and I can get the keycards at the reception. To be fair, I did phone the reception earlier to have the keys brought to our room once ready but because I wanted everything to sort out in person, I went to the reception even though it's kinda far and hot. The duty manager is very helpful and attentive. He gave me the keycard for the other rooms and sorted the keycard problem himself by going to the room and resetting them. He even called to sort out the complimentary bday cake for my mum. I was very frustrated with the mishap with the check-in process (rooms not being ready and the waiting time. Turns out none of the beds were combined so had to wait on for them to finish. Everyone was able to get into their rooms at past 4pm) but they managed to make up with their shortcomings. I'm sure they also didn't want any inconvenience for their guests but I hope they thoroughly check requests and room service would be quick next time. Overall, I'd still go back to Merusaka as staffs are amazing. Always warm, friendly and helpful. The beach and pool are superb. The hotel looks lovely. We had a family photoshoot too (outside photog). They offered complimentary but unfortunately the photographer is fully booked and only available on the day of our flight."
"145.","Elisha Peterson S. K. Teo","36","2025-06-30","5","Beautiful resort! Previously called Putri Bali and later on called Inaya Putri Bali before now being called Merusaka Nusa Dua.

"146.","Jonathan Ding","1","2025-06-30","1","Today’s experience is terrible. Hotel infrastructure is good but service is terrible. We found no hot water in shower room, told duty manager face t face, he just sent two technicians after 30mins, and told me it’s nature as the consumption is high… I was shocked that they gave me this reason. I tried to call duty manager two times after but he never pickup the phone. Now it’s 2200pm and my wife and I still waiting for the hot water"
"147.","Dev D","28","2025-05-30","2","The resort is located at the seashore. The location of the resort was very convenient, however I’ve to be honest here as the staff was not friendly … they didn’t provide many information transparently mainly from their booking perspective. Apparently we found that child isn’t a part of family and it’s only two adults being considered as a guest… rest is charged. The staff is more interested in getting bill sorted out even before your child has had their breakfast (surprised right). Even the food options and food quality wasn’t that great. They do provide additional services such as booking scooter etc., however they don’t share the correct information on the spot and you’re there to blame for. Apparently what we experienced was if you book scooter via them is almost 100k rupiah higher compared to directly dealing with the scooter rental company. According to our experience the place is over rated."
"148.","Deb Tan","159","2025-03-30","2","This hotel was pretty underwhelming compared to the other places we stayed in Bali. Nothing really stood out. We arrived 30 minutes before check-in and were told to wait at the restaurant until our room was ready. An hour passed with no update, so we had to follow up ourselves—only to find out the room had been ready for a while. Given the heat and humidity, we just wanted to settle into a cooler space as soon as possible. We were hesitant to book this hotel due to its distance from the main areas, and while Bali Collection being nearby was a plus, without it, you’d feel stuck at the resort. The overall vibe wasn’t great, and the staff didn’t seem as warm or welcoming as in other places we stayed. The restaurant menu was on the pricier side, so you might want to explore other dining options. Another downside was the lack of information provided—staff never informed us about the resort’s activities or included amenities. We had to look everything up ourselves or ask, which made the experience feel less engaging. Because of this, we ended up just staying in our room just to sleep and shower. Most of the time we were outside the hotel and never fully got to experience what the resort had to offer, if any. On top of that, you have to pay extra to rent their worn-out bikes, about $6 i think for an hour. Lol. The only decent part was the beachfront. However, the pool lounge beds were limited compared to the number of guests, so finding a spot was a challenge. Lastly, the room’s exhaust and sewage system desperately needed maintenance—it had an unpleasant smell throughout our stay. Might want to skip this hotel & choose another one! :)"

"153.","Božul Bobková","42","2025-04-30","2","This hotel is quite different in not a good way compared to other hotels we visited in Bali. It reminds me a bit a factory. The breakfast is a joke for 5 star hotel and in comparison with other hotels in Bali. Moreover, various salami, ham and cheese is left in the warmth without cooling turning almost color to green. We had to be careful what to take in order to avoid stomach issues. The restaurants are overpriced for the quality with less friendly staff. Moreover, i unexpectedly needed female sanitary products, i asked for help a male receptionist. He called someone and asked but he was telling it in the phone like in a machist way and laughing about that. He finally recommended their hotel shop but I felt very uncomfortable in this situation. All in all, probably my only mistake I made while booking hotels. Not approved. Reply to tge manager reply: No, for many salami and cheese there was no ice at all, they were left on sipmler platter. For instance in the pork station. Or in the middle of the room, from one side were juices and other side cheese and salami. The cooling was provided e.g. for milk."

"160.","Ivascu Vesna","5","2025-01-30","1","I booked my stay through a travel agency in Bali, and since I did not make my reservation directly on Booking.com, I am leaving my review here to assist other travelers in making informed decisions. First and foremost, I want to ensure that potential guests are not misled by agencies in Bali or Romania into choosing this hotel, as it could ruin their vacation experience. The pricing is significantly inflated; it seems that travel agencies secure reservations at very low rates and then pass on the cost to tourists. Otherwise, I cannot comprehend why they would recommend a place that charges the same rates as renowned international hotels where you can genuinely find five-star service. This hotel barely qualifies as a three-star establishment. I booked four nights with breakfast, but I couldn't manage to sleep even a single night. When I requested a refund, the manager flatly refused to reimburse me. The rooms were in terrible condition—furniture was old, mattresses were worn out, and the linens were stained as if there had been bedbugs. The air conditioning was noisy and inadequate for what one would expect from a five-star hotel, where a quiet internal ventilation system should allow for a restful night's sleep. The staff appeared poorly groomed, with dirty uniforms. The pool area was unkempt, and there was litter on the paths and beach. The overall state of maintenance is glaringly evident from the hotel lobby, where the tattered upholstery on the chairs and the dirt on the floor immediately capture your attention. I noticed that this hotel has a high rating on Booking.com; however, I suspect that unfavorable reviews may have been deleted. For those from Romania reading this, I must say that staying here feels akin to being at Eforie. I hope my experience can save others from a disappointing stay."

"172.","amandagaz","5","2025-05-30","5","Every meal, drink, and staff member we encountered at the Merusaka was the best that we have ever experienced Bali. There were only two negatives for us. * Only stayed for 5 nights (not long enough) * We watched numerous guests put their towels/belongings on pool/beach lounges and leave for up to 2-4 hours and come back afterwards. This we feel is not only rude but not fair on other guests who want to enjoy the resort as well. We would like to make a special mention about one particular staff member Bagas who worked at the pool bar. He was more than friendly and went over and above to recommend different menu items at different restaurants around the resort, he really made us feel welcomed every time we saw him. The staff at Ja'Jin By The Sea were also exceptional."

The hotel is in a perfect location, just 25 minutes from the airport and right next to a shopping area, making everything easily accessible. The beach is pristine, the pools are fantastic, and the restaurants offer delicious food. What truly sets this place apart is the incredible staff—attentive, friendly, and always ready to assist. Whatever we needed was arranged within minutes, making our experience seamless and enjoyable. The only minor issue was a slight humidity smell in the room, but given the tropical climate, it was expected and didn’t impact our overall experience.

"190.","Guilherme Paschoal","45","2025-04-30","1","I wish I could say better things but the stay was merely ok. Nusa Dua is a nice place to stay but this hotel is far from 5 stars. You can find in other reviews about the hotel infrastructure and the rooms. What I am here to point out is the delay on returning the deposit that they ask. Yes, they ask you for a 2,000,000 rupiah deposit which is about 115 euros and well... I have no idea when I'm getting my money back. I have messaged their guest services and it was indeed a fast reply saying that their bank is taking long to reply. They have sent emails to the bank but who knows? I can't be the first one to pay this deposit by credit card so what the hell is the problem? 10 business days gone and no refund yet. Maybe I'll come back in a couple of days to say I was stolen."

The only thing that impacted our stay was transiting to the Airport. There no hold over area with air conditioning just an area to wait before leaving to the Airport. We asked for a late check out we were told 1:30? 1:30 is not a late check out 3:30 or 4:30 in most resort that this would be a good time for a late check. There are is not a hold over area to play table pool, watch TV, with wi-fi in aircon area. Other than that I still recommend coming here it’s a nice place. —————————————————- Me and my lovely wife spent a we here. This resort is wonderful it has everything you need. The restaurant is awesome, beach access multiple pools. Adult pools with bar all view of the ocean. The spa was very nice as well. We had a blast. I differently recommend.

Other inconsiderate travellers started walking in the hall very early. I can even hear next door go to toilet. I stayed at 5 different hotels in Bali.

"201.","Moiz Hassanali","9","2025-01-30","4","Merusaka Nusa Dua is a good hotel with great facilities, but the service could be improved. After experiencing other exceptional hotels in Bali with outstanding service, this one falls slightly short in comparison. The facilities are excellent, with a large swimming pool area and a beautiful private beach. The beach is very clean, the ocean is crystal clear, and the private setting adds to its charm. Service, however, was not up to the mark. While we understand it’s a large and busy hotel, the personalized attention that Bali is known for was lacking. I’d rate the service 3 stars. The food is decent but not exceptional. The buffet offers a wide variety, though it’s more of a standard spread for breakfast and lunch rather than something extraordinary. We also dined at one of the beachside restaurants, but the food was just average. I’d recommend booking a pool access room, which shares a pool among six rooms. It’s a relaxing option when spending time in your room. The room size is decent, but the overall vibe of the hotel feels more commercial than boutique. Overall, it’s a nice place to stay, especially for its facilities and beach, but the service and food could use some improvement."

"203.","Tijana Filipovic","32","2024-12-30","4","The best thing about this hotel are the swimming pools. They are absolutely 5 stars. Comparing to other hotels in Nusa Dua, Merusaka has the largest and most beautiful pools. They are not crowded and are open 24h. Rooms are nice, quite spacious, with stunning bathrooms. The balcony is very small though, and has just one chair so it is impossible to enjoy it. Breakfast has a lot of variety and most of it tastes good, but it gets very crowded. The beach is good too, with a lot of sunbeds. It is also very convenient that every table/sunbed has a QR code so you can order food and drinks easily without having to call the waiters. There are however 2 reasons why I gave 4 stars and not 5. The hotel is a bit old, parts of it really need some fixing/renovation. For example beach towels are old and ripped, with stains, as well as the mats on the sunbeds. Also some of the wooden tiles around the pool are damaged. The second reason for giving 1 star less is the fact that side exit gate is poorly lit at night, as you climb the stairs, the lights shine directly up into your eyes instead of lighting the stairs, so I fell and twisted my ankle. But in general the hotel is fine and I would recommend it"

The food is fantastic, offering a variety of delicious options that cater to all tastes. Despite visiting at the end of the rainy season, the weather was perfect, making our stay even more enjoyable. Every corner of this resort exudes beauty and tranquility. Some rooms could use a slight update, but that’s more of a minor detail than an actual issue.

So we thought to try the Merusaka all inclusive package for 4 pool access rooms seven months ago and the only request was we be close together. Upon arrival all rooms were separated and we asked if possible did they get the correspondence (subject to availability) The next night they were able to accomodate our rooms together which was nice but probably could've been avoided seeing the room bookings were all under my name. Arriving at 1pm we left our baggage at reception to wait for our room or check-in at 3pm. Check out mean't the all inclusive package ended at 12 noon (including free Wifi) unlike the Melia where they were accommodating from your arrival until your departure airport transfers. The menu never changes and extra surcharges applied for certain meals."

"212.","543lavender","36","2024-12-30","4","I loved staying here and would probably return. A bubble of paradise, we had a room that had its own pool(shared with three other rooms but we rarely intersected). We ordered room service a lot as it was quite good value for money and really tasty. The international restaurant was the best, however the beach bar was disappointing unfortunately(weird how it can be so different in the same location). Oh and please try their spa, the hot oil marma point massage was exquisite."
"213.","Albert Peters","17","2024-12-30","3","The hotel is nice and well presented. Staff are polite, but very slow with service. I don't recommend the all inclusive package. The all inclusive package has its own menu with limited choices and surge charges on certain meals. They do not have room service included in the all inclusive package. You also seem to be at the end of the line for service at the restaurants once they see your all inclusive wrist band, slowing down their service even more. There have been occasions that up to three non exclusive tables received their drinks and food before ours, but ordered their order after ours."
"214.","Derry Santoso","72","2024-12-30","4","During my recent business trip, I had the opportunity to stay at an established hotel for two nights. Despite its age, the property impressed me with its well-maintained condition and cleanliness. My arrival experience was seamless, thanks to the company's efficient handling of the check-in process. Each morning, I looked forward to the diverse breakfast spread. The variety of options catered to different tastes, and I found the flavors particularly appealing to my palate. This pleasant start set a positive tone for my days at the hotel. As I navigated my stay, I observed that the overall experience met a satisfactory standard. The rooms, common areas, and amenities all functioned as expected, contributing to a comfortable visit. However, one aspect caught my attention. The front office staff, while professional, appeared to be under considerable pressure. Their constant busyness suggested a potential understaffing issue, which might impact guest service during peak times. In conclusion, while the hotel delivered a generally positive experience, addressing the staffing situation at the front desk could elevate the overall quality of service and guest satisfaction."

The hotel is very modern and clean and our rooms (pool access) were made for us by the cleaning staff. We got the floating breakfast on our last morning and it’s delicious. Would recommend! The food in the hotel has been excellent with plenty of choice and high quality, aswell as a great drink selection. There are plenty of places to sit around the numerous pools and you are served food and drinks to your sunbed which you can order via the app. All of the staff here have been outstanding and very helpful and pleasant. The location is great as you are right on the beach and only a five minute walk from the Bali collection (a great shopping area). Thank you very much Merusaka for an amazing stay!

"217.","Eliza Murphy","6","2025-03-02","3","We booked an all inclusive 5 night stay here through Luxury Escapes. The staff were absolutely lovely, food and service great. The resort does look a little run down in places. They constructing and upgrading the decks around the terraced pools so the drop saw, hammer drill etc were very noisy when trying to relax by the pool and at the main bar. The rooms are extremely noisy, other inconsiderate guests yelling in the halls, constantly ringing door bells and walking crying babies around at 10pm ecco through the entire block. Our last night was particularly horrendous with a group of foreign travellers partying in the ground floor pool of block 4 until midnight, drinking, yelling, laughing, singing and blasting music. Twice we had to call security and eventually they were made to go inside the second time security came. It definitely put a sour taste in our mouth at the end of our holiday and instead of going home we'll rested we are tired and grumpy."
"218.","Claire Gillon","60","2025-05-30","2","I so wanted to enjoy a stay in a 4 star hotel in Nusa Dua. Unfortunately, what we got was disappointment. Firstly, I want to point out the staff were amazingly friendly. Otherwise, we felt we'd dropped into the twilight zone. Nothing about it being Balinese authentic, apart from the beautiful staff. Yes, the pools are nice and the beach lovely. Magnificent building. However, I could have been anywhere but not Bali. The breakfast was like an old fashioned cafeteria style. Food ok but no atmosphere at all. Again staff couldn't be more friendly. This hotel and Nusa Dua I feel is ok for people who want to go to Bali but have none of the Balinese culture. We stayed one night of three. Choosing to lose the money we'd paid and ran back to Sanur. Obviously not for us."

Upon checkin, they regretfully inform me that garden view rooms are unavailable with king beds, and we receive a two bed room - with stains on the sofa, no charging place for phones, lacking other basic things and just rusty and dated. After complaining, in 1 hour, magically the king bed room appears and we are offered to change to it. Ventilation system is so loud even on low, that it is impossible to sleep. This place is really overpriced for what it offers."
"224.","Sunshine K","12","2025-04-30","1","This is a huge hotel. It desperately needs to renovated and needs major upgrades.Everything is less than mediocre. It is definitely not a 5 star resort.

"226.","Jon Tarifa","7","2024-12-30","1","We are deeply disappointed with our experience at this resort. We specifically chose this destination to escape the chaos of Canggu, only to find ourselves in an even louder environment. Throughout our stay, there was an incredibly noisy wedding happening, completely ruining any chance of relaxation. As a family of four, it was impossible for us to enjoy our time—our children were unsettled and uncomfortable due to the constant, deafening noise throughout the venue. To make matters worse, we couldn’t even enjoy a peaceful walk on the beach without feeling like we were intruding on the wedding. When we brought up our concerns at checkout, both the receptionist and manager on duty showed zero empathy. There was no apology—just a dismissive response that this kind of disruption was normal and something we should accept. Frankly, that attitude was infuriating. On top of all this, the restaurant staff couldn’t even get our orders right, making mistakes multiple times during our short two-night stay. This was far from the relaxing getaway we were hoping for, and we won’t be coming back."
"227.","Maria Karen Kowatsch","53","2025-09-30","3","This hotel under new Merusaka management is very disappointing. I requested a simple booking amendment, but their response was slow, unprofessional, and not in line with the stated policy. Poor customer service and misleading advertising — very untrustworthy. I was excited to come back second time around now I am not comfortable retuning with their rude responses , no empathy given just money hungry. Old management was better. I was due to come back and do a critic after being advised that hotel quality has changed. Looks like this is right! Hospitality has been above and beyond. Rooms are super spacious and clean! Their bath tubs are to die for. Perfect location, walk to Bali connection and other places in nusa dua. 4 restaurants are all generous in food servings; all super delicious, spa is divine, huge kids pool, adult pools, lots of kids activities in kids club and beach activities. Staff are super helpful with kids and security is top notch. The beach also is at your door step, just Pristine. We have stayed at the Sofitel and grant Hyatt in the past. This hotel makes them Look over rated. We will definitely be coming back. Also restaurants offer different entertainment on different nights. Lots of things to do, that you don’t want to go anywhere else! Thank You for making our family Holiday super fun!"

After calling their support for 1-2 hrs they were of no help .. support staff were just repeating same lines.,.we will get you call back but no one called.. finally we again went to reception and complaint then he reassigned the rooms after 45 min approx . Not to mention the long queues in reception. People were standing in queue to checkin and check out. Very bad service for a high end resort ."

"239.","Einas Ali","73","2024-12-30","4","I recently stayed at Merusaka Nusa Dua and had a pleasant overall experience. The hotel offers a beautiful environment with great views, a fantastic location near the ocean, and plenty of spacious walking areas to explore around the resort. The tranquil atmosphere of Nusa Dua adds to the appeal, making it a perfect choice for a relaxing getaway. The hotel facilities are impressive, and it was thoughtful of them to provide umbrellas for guests during the rainy days. The breakfast spread had a wide variety of options, but I found the quality and taste of the food could use improvement. The rooms were big and spacious, which was a major plus, but the furniture is noticeably in need of renovation. Room cleaning services were somewhat inconsistent and would benefit from better attention to detail. One standout aspect was the staff, who were exceptionally friendly and responsive, ensuring that guest needs were addressed promptly. A pro tip for future guests: opt for a room away from the ballroom and restaurant areas to avoid potential noise disruptions. Overall, Merusaka Nusa Dua offers a peaceful retreat with stunning surroundings, but there are a few areas, particularly maintenance and food quality, that need improvement to elevate the guest experience further. I’d still recommend it for those looking for a serene stay in Bali."

"244.","Tejash Shah","4","2025-04-30","1","The booking process is a nightmare, with errors on reservation that no one bothered to resolve. The welcome service was non-existent, and I was left standing at the reception for an unreasonably long time before being checked in. To make matters worse, there was no fan or AC available at the reception, making it unbearable to wait. Definitely not what you'd expect from a 5-star hotel. Would never recommend any one. This 5* is worst then the non star hotel."
"245.","Wei Long Tan","36","2024-12-30","1","This hotel was a complete disappointment. The room was shockingly outdated, and the air conditioning unit was utterly inadequate. Not only did it fail to provide sufficient cooling, but it also sprung a leak during my stay. To add insult to injury, my wife was viciously attacked by bedbugs, leaving blood stains all over the bedding. The hotel's response was utterly inadequate. They merely offered to change the sheets, displaying a complete disregard for the severity of the situation. Only after significant pressure did they agree to relocate us to a different room. No other form of compensation was offered, and the duty manager Gusti's attitude was appalling, insisting that these were simply usual Bali bugs/mosquitos, a claim that is both insulting and inaccurate especially given the photo evidence. The breakfast experience was equally appalling. Snaking long queues to be seated every morning and guests were forced in the scorching sun or rain, as staff callously refused to allow them to wait in the shade. It was so bad I checked out a night early (which they refused to refund), and I strongly advise all potential travelers to steer clear of this substandard establishment."
"246.","Shane","191","2024-12-30","5","Absolutely amazing resort right on Nusa Dua Beach. Our room was very clean and spacious. The pools were very well maintained and never crowded so we always had plenty of space to ourselves. The food at all four restaurants in the resort were excellent, delicious western and Indonesian food options with a massive selection in the breakfast buffet. The staff were all incredibly friendly and always greeted us with a smile, made us really feel at home. My partner is also coeliac and they made sure she had gluten free options for breakfast every morning and prepared her gluten free toast, waffles, pancakes, stir fried rice noodles and fried rice. On top of that all the restaurants had plenty of gluten free options for her to choose from, it was great to see they catered so well to dietary requirements too. We had a fantastic stay here and can’t wait to be back!"
"247.","Will T","5","2024-12-30","2","Clearly the worst hospitality we received during our time in Bali! While the location of the hotel is great, our experience here was soured by the terrible customer service we received from the duty manager upon arrival. Though we understand (as was explained to us) that the hotel had received an incorrect booking code for the room type we had booked on trip.com, we felt that the matter could have been handled a lot better by the manager, who could have shown a little goodwill towards their guests, considering we had shown her a copy of our booking confirmation. We were given a standard deluxe room even though we had booked one with pool access, and were told that if we wanted the room we had booked (and already paid for) we would have to offer a guarantee! Thankfully, the trip.com agent we chatted to was able to resolve the issue within a couple of hours, and we were able to check into our correct hotel room later. The manager offered no response or apology for the incident, showing a complete lack of care in their guest. Pros: The location is the best thing about this place, near a pleasant beach and a close walk to the Bali Collection shopping area. The staff handling the luggage and driving the carts were great. Cons: The room we received was dated and had a musty smell that would occasionally waft through. Also, the first room we had to check in to had a shower that was in need of repair. Some of the staff could be a bit more helpful. For example, there was a very long line at checkout. I approached the concierge to ask if there was a quicker way to check out as we just needed to drop the cards off. I was told no, that I had to join the queue. It was only later while speaking to another hotel guest that I found out there was a self-checkout computer at the front desk. I’m not sure if it’s a lack of training with the staff, but things like this are important to us guests. TLDR: Nice location, terrible hospitality from the duty manager, tired musty room."
"248.","Pankaj","32","2024-12-30","5","Best resort experience of my life so far. The whole place is gorgeous, with an amazing landscape and beautiful beach. It has its own holiday vibe. The rooms are spacious. Ground floor rooms have swimming pools just outside the door. There were folks from all over the globe there, which reflected very well in the food options they serve. There are a few stalls in case you want to get some cool souvenirs or dresses within the premises. Would definitely recommend it to everyone going to Bali."

"250.","Jai Delaney","2","2025-03-02","5","Fantastic experience! Lovely staff, great service, fabulous food and spoilt for choice. From the moment we checked in we felt very well looked after. We booked the private pool access room, with an all inclusive package, this was money very well spent, great selection of food and drinks, free flowing drinks and cocktails, only a few items (steak and seafood) that required a additional surcharge but this was very resonable between $5 and $8 AUD extra, for these special meals. A great variety of food and drinks across 4 different restaurants, we tried them all. We were never disappointed as all the food was great. We did the special Oyster night event and the Oysters were live, freshly shucked prior to serving. YUMMO! Also you must try their signature Nasi Goreng absolutley delicious! A special shout out to Purnama, and all the staff at Gading restaurant, great service, always with a smile and nothing is a problem for them. They have to deal with so many issues and just outright, rude, entitled, nasty, people but they always manage to smile and resolve any issues. Again, amazing staff that do a fabulous job of making all guests comfortable. I was surprised to see a few negative Google reviews before we arrived, and was a bit hesitant booking, but once we arrived all my worries quickly melted away. For anyone reading these reviews, ignore the negatives, they are most likely from the nasty, rude, entitled guests mentioned above. We will definitely be back to Merusaka, just a fantastic experience all round. 10 out of 10! Thanks to all the team at Merusaka we are looking forward to seeing you all again next year. Suksma!"

"254.","praveen nair","4","2024-12-30","2","I had a deeply disappointing experience at this so-called 5-star hotel, which turned out to be both unprofessional and utterly underwhelming. The staff were extremely rude, untrained, and ill-equipped to handle guests or manage a crowd. The facilities were nowhere near the standards expected of a 5-star property, and the breakfast options were limited and of poor quality. What made the experience even worse was the apparent favoritism shown toward Caucasian guests, while those who were brown, like us, were blatantly ignored. This behavior felt like soft racism and was incredibly disheartening. During breakfast on one occasion, a staff member accidentally sprayed cleaning detergent in my wife’s direction and hit her with a chair while trying to accommodate a Caucasian family. Instead of apologizing, they attempted to justify their actions, which was both unprofessional and insulting. Basic services were also shockingly absent. For instance, there were no umbrellas provided in the corridors during the rainy season. After check-out, there was no one available to assist with our luggage, and we had to carry heavy bags across multiple levels on our own. During my 15-day trip to Bali, I stayed at four different hotels, and this was by far the worst experience, despite being the most expensive. The unprofessionalism, substandard facilities, and discriminatory behavior made it a place I will never return to. I strongly advise others to avoid this hotel."

We were on our honeymoon and my husband's birthday, this hotel arranged for a cake upon request and even decorated our room with flower petals along with the bathtub! The location is just amazing and has breathtaking views from the property . The room however had no great view. They have 3 large swimming pools and private access to the beach. The breakfast options for vegetarians were very limited so we were little disappointed with that. The room was spacious and even the bathrooms were spacious. Please note - there is no jet spray in the washroom so please carry a portable in need. The buggy from entrance to main hotel entrance is very limited so wait time is alot. We prefered walking in this case. Rest we had an amazing time at this property, enjoyed alot and had a really good overall experience."

(-) the valet parking was confusing, first there’s a guy who told me to park by my self which is lil bit far away from the hotel location… i went there but there’s no people from the hotel “pick us up” to the lobby…. Then i back drive the car to front of the lobby and meet different “guy” that said he will park my car so i can do check-in….

Pool staff had to go get us a towel from him- pool stays open till late. Pool staff just stand in a group. We had bottles, glasses and food plates stacked up for hours at the table, this had the flys swarming in the area. In room bath was not clean and had sand grit in there the first day. Dated and worn out facilities, ripped beach lounge seat cushions All inclusive package was not worth it. Worst pizza I’ve ever had. Indonesian restaurant had good food tho.

"265.","Emma Gardner","39","2024-12-30","3","Visually, this is a stunning resort no doubts about that. The gardens are immaculate, the pools are plentiful and access to the beach is perfect. It feels like its within a gated community. The resort on face value is 5 star but when you get into it it falls a little short. Little things like paper napkins instead linen (for all meals including dinner) When you sit at a table they are slow to attend to it with cutlery, menu's. The pressure on one dining area for breakfast was too much, there was a large conference at the hotel the same time we stayed and really the hotel should use the other dining spaces to break up the amount of people, there is a Indonesian restaurant area but that was only Indonesian food. = breakfast had a large selection but was to cluttered and chaotic. Service is so slow and lacked attention to detail - we asked for a chicken wrap to NOT include tomato and we ended up with a vine's worth. We ended up leaving the resort the few evenings we were there to have dinner at the local Bali Collection (worth a visit, great selection of restaurants) It may call itself a family friendly resort but I don't agree - a kids club and kids menu does not make it so. The pool closets to the beach was the one we utilised the most as it was the only one where a little bit of playtime fun and noise was welcomed (and fair enough, other people should be able to enjoy their holidays in quiet enjoyment) and was at times unpleasant - smoking at the swim up bar, at tables while people were eating and around the pool - not so family friendly (imo) - plus the music had all sorts of profanity within it. Personally we won't be back and its not somewhere I'll recommend to friends with children. However, as a couple or a group of adults it is a lovely place to go it is away from the louder parts of Bali."
"266.","Ed Phillips","16","2024-12-30","4","As posted by many others, the rooms are very tired. Everyone has different standards, but we found the rooms tired, a bit smelly, worn.. The resort has a number of blocks that contain rooms, but to me it felt like a public housing blocks. Most rooms are facing another block so not a lot of privacy on the balconies, which are tiny, barely 2 chairs fit. The first rooms we got were dark and smelly, we asked for another 2 rooms. We got rooms in the last block facing the road, which I preferred as the rooms got a lot of light, and the road didn't bother us. The road is not public, instead the driveway for the resort. The positives, location is great. Walking distance to Bali collection 5-10min, beach access. The pools were fantastic. They are big, and lots of room, you never feel like you are too close to anyone, and the hotel was at full capacity. The grounds are massive and very well managed. The service was great. We only had breakfast included. The choice is big, but the taste of a lot of food was bland.. Still lots of options, so you can always find something to eat. Message to management- the pastries are awful... seriously, get another supplier. We would stay again, but would try and get a suit or something similar as they are much nicer rooms."

"274.","Ariff Aris","54","2024-12-30","4","Located at Nusa Dua Beach, excellent hotel with good facilities, buggy service, and big swimming pools. This hotel is big and spacious. However, the rooms are basic, but the hotel services and beach chairs are plentiful and that makes up for the rooms. Although high season, it was worth the stay. Plenty of room during breakfast, beachside beds. The beach however had a lot of dead seaweed/grass and if that bothers you, then it's not a good beach to swim in. Apart from that, everything was great, very close to Bali Collection. Enjoyed my 3 days stay."

Pada hari ulang tahun istri saya, pihak hotel memberikan kejutan berupa complimentary cake & sebucket bunga segar yang cantik. Kamar di dekor sangat cantik, dengan ucapan happy birhday, hiasan balon & bunga di kamar serta taburan bunga di bath up kamar mandi. Istri saya sangat menikmati momen tersebut & kami sangat berterima kasih atas surprise yang diberikan oleh pihak hotel Kami sangat puas menginap di Merusaka. Mulai dari kondisi kamar yang baik, kolam renang yang bersih (saya lihat petugas nya rajin membersihkan kolam), staff yang sangat ramah dalam melayani tamu, sarapan yang bervariasi, serta lingkungan kamar yang nyaman & tidak berisik, serta kejutan yang diberikan saat birthday ataupun aniversary, hotel ini sangat pantas mendapatkan rating penilaian 5 dari 5. Hotel ini juga dilengkapi dengan kids club & kolam renang anak jika menginap bersama anak (kids friendly). Jika mau ke Pantai, hotel ini juga memiliki akses langsung ke pantai. LUAR BIASA!!! Secara khusus kami berterima kasih kepada pak Tedy & Pak Dicky yang telah banyak membantu kami selama kami menginap di Merusaka..."
"276.","Andrew Quinn","5","2025-05-30","5","Certainly the pick of the bunch along the Nusa Dua Mengiat Beach area. Lovely grounds, great swimming pools, great restaurants/food & lovely people. Food was very nice in all restaurants with a large selection particularly in Gading. Certainly recommend."
"277.","Heidi Buhner","9","2023-12-30","3","The location is lovely, within a secure estate with beautiful surrounds. The grounds of the hotel itself are also beautiful and the sunsets are incredible - but I do have to agree with many other reviews that the hotel itself is definitely not 5 stars, which is fine, but should be adjusted to be more accurate and realistic for those considering it for their stay - and the prices should also be adjusted to align. The buildings are weathered and worn, needing attention. Our deluxe pool side room was dated with old, stained furniture and just needed a deep clean (also see a few reviews stating this and it’s true). Some of the beach lounges were torn and just look a bit worse for wear. The pools are nice and probably good for kids. The food is pretty good overall, though somewhat limited if eating between the two main restaurants (similar menus). The staff were lovely and seem to navigate all the various clientele as best as possible. The touches just aren’t there as you may expect for a 5 star, or certainly ones I’ve stayed in previously. Again, this is all fine if you are aware of what you are getting when booking which is why this hotel should probably be considered closer to 3 stars. And unfortunately I truly felt we paid far too much for what it ended up being."
"278.","Barry Falco","16","2025-04-30","5","Review of MERUSAKA Resort, Nusa Dua, Bali Having recently stayed at the MERUSAKA Resort in Nusa Dua, Bali, I would like to share my experience and highlight what an excellent destination this is. From check-in to check-out five days later, every aspect of the resort impressed—from the quality of the facilities and accommodation to the variety of restaurants and bars, and the prime location. What truly set the resort apart, however, was the staff. Every member of the team—whether at reception, assisting with baggage, housekeeping, or food and beverage service—was consistently helpful, professional, and welcoming. It was clear that the staff enjoy their work, which was evident in their positive and engaging interactions with guests. Whatever MERUSAKA is doing in terms of staff management, pay, training, or workplace culture, it is clearly effective and contributes significantly to the overall guest experience. For anyone considering a trip to Bali, I would strongly recommend staying at MERUSAKA Resort. It offers a truly five-star experience in every regard."
"279.","Jane Lyukimson","30","2024-12-30","5","Absolutely amazing resort. We had a pleasure of staying in one of the villas at the resort with club access. Loved every minute of our stay, from the warmest of welcomes, smooth and fast check in, golf cart drive up to the villa and the welcome flowers and mini deserts plate, The villa is spacious with a great interior and very comfortable private pool. The cherry on the cake was the 135 meter swimming pool that looked like a tropical river between the two rows of the villas. The overhanging frangipani trees with the fragrant flowers and little garden islands made this feature something special. Buffet breakfast was amazing with plenty of choice and very caring and attentive staff and the settings was overlooking the sea and the beach. The grounds are very clean and neat and the garden beds are immaculately cared for. Yoga classes every morning are priceless. Bike hire is convenient. Afternoon tea, cocktails and set of mini deserts in the villa every evening are the details that made our stay so pleasant. Looking forward to coming back to this resort in the nearest possible future. Jane and Sergey, Melbourne, Australia"

I was offered no compensation or discount. Being unable to walk properly or swim made the holiday a huge disappointment.. management blocked off the step so no one else could trip, but would not acknowledge my injuries."

"283.","Rox Aus","140","2024-12-30","4","Off the bat, the reception area is impressive (see video). Beautiful architecture on entry. Location is perfect: beachfront hotel, 10mins walk to Bali Connection to the right of the hotel and 10 mins walk to local shops/supermarket to the left. The grounds are huge and immaculately kept. Beautiful flowers everywhere. Numerous pools to choose from and plenty of beach chairs if beachfront is where you want to be. Many compliments to the staff that put in so much effort to keeping the grounds beautiful. Fitness centre is well stocked with weights and different machines. The only fault I could really pick is with our room (6112). Pool access was THE ABSOLUTE BEST after a long hot day exploring Bali. We used it so much. BUT -- Though the bed is soft, the pillows could use replacing as they were not comfy. We had a sewage smell occasionally coming from our bathroom, the aircon blasts so loud (even on Low setting) and the minibar fridge struggles to keep drinks cold. The room could use a few more hooks to hang clothing and USB charging ports by the bed. In all fairness, I can see how the rooms were once '5-star, luxury' but they could really use a revamp of the small things. Staff/Service: Fantastic! If you ever needed service, there was always someone around to help you and reception was quite helpful. Breakfast buffet was excellent! Lots of food to offer including local Balinese food. Bacon, egg station (of all kinds), noodle station, sausages, sushi, tropical fruits, Indonesian food, bread table and all kinds of desserts/cake. Overall, still happy with our stay because we really utilised the pool access, enjoyed the hotel facilities and the location was central."

What truly set this resort apart was the extraordinary care and attention given to us when my wife and children fell ill during our stay. The staff was incredibly understanding and supportive, ensuring we had everything we needed to make a swift recovery. The food at the resort was excellent, with a diverse menu catering to all tastes and dietary needs. Every meal was a delight, and the quality of ingredients was top-notch. The friendly and helpful nature of the staff made our dining experiences even more enjoyable. The accommodations were comfortable and well-maintained, providing a perfect retreat after our days out or just to relax and recover. The overall ambiance of the resort was tranquil and inviting, making it a perfect escape from the hustle and bustle. We are immensely grateful to the staff for their kindness and efficiency. Their professionalism and warmth truly made our stay unforgettable. We highly recommend Merusaka to anyone visiting Bali and looking for a stay that goes above and beyond in every aspect."

"290.","Alexandra Bodrova","14","2024-12-30","5","Very nice hotel!! Super relaxing, great private beach area, very nice and accommodating staff, awesome breakfast, and huge nice territory of the hotel! Stayed for 9 nights with a friend, and loved it!! The room was huge, with an equally huge bathroom:) Overall absolutely loved our stay there, got to do a lot of relaxing and even a bit of surfing, as well as a bunch of nice light walking through the shoreline of Nusa dua to a very nice park area that also had awesome restaurants at the end of the peninsula. Most of the other hotel guests were families or couples (so if you want to party, that is not the best fit for you), and while at breakfast we saw a lot of people, the beach and the swimming pools looked pretty empty, as they are large and people can spread out - never had trouble finding a good spot with lounge chairs. The only disadvantage is that the seashore is pretty dirty, but it is not the hotel’s fault - that whole side of Nusa Dua is like this because of the currents and tides."

"292.","Delvy G","311","2024-12-30","5","I love the pools in this hotel, they have a couple of them, from a very shallow ones for you children and even one designed for you to do high jumps. Off course they also have a one that you can chill and enjoy the pool bar. Service is great, at par with other hotels in Nusa Dua. I don't think it's significantly better from other hotels. The ladies that tended the Child's club are great and very patient and friendly though. Food was okay, they have quite a good selection of foods during breakfast, but more towards local foods. I love the coffee (even though it comes out of a machine) and the variations of drinks the have (Jamu and Juices). Their traditional snack selection is also good. The rooms are spacious, the bathroom were almost as big as the room itself, providing you with a big tub and a large shower. The only thing that made me give them 4-stars is that the rooms have not been maintained very well. Rusts on the tub, AC that was dripping water and TVs that are still not smart TVs. on a good note they seemed to be fixing the hotel back to it's former glory again. Will look forward in staying here again and see what they have done to update the place."

The property has been very well-maintained; even after six years since our first visit, the rooms and hotel areas remain clean and in excellent condition. The check-in process was very quick, the hotel facilities were complete, the beach was beautiful, the pool was clean, and all the staff worked quickly and professionally. Thank you to the Merusaka team for such a memorable holiday. Our children truly enjoyed their time at Merusaka!"

"299.","Rishabh Sharma","75","2024-12-30","4","A Luxurious Stay at Merusaka Resort, Nusa Dua – A True Balinese Gem We recently had the pleasure of staying at Merusaka Resort, Nusa Dua, in the stunning One Bedroom Pool Villa, and our experience was truly remarkable. Here's a breakdown of our stay: 1. Infrastructure (9/10) The resort is an architectural masterpiece, seamlessly blending traditional Balinese aesthetics with modern luxury. The One Bedroom Pool Villa was spotless, spacious, and equipped with an incredible private pool, a massive bathtub, and a beautifully designed bathroom. The air conditioning was perfect for Bali's tropical climate, and while the lighting was slightly dim, it added to the cozy ambiance. 2. Butler Service (11/10) The butler service was exceptional, available from 7 AM to 11 PM, and catered to our every need with remarkable professionalism. Whether it was arranging a buggy or fulfilling special requests, the butlers were always prompt and polite. A special shoutout to Maru, Suprapto, Anta and Adip, whose warmth and attentiveness made our stay even more enjoyable. Their efforts were beyond commendable. 3. Food (8/10) The dining options at the resort were diverse and satisfying. We dined at their Western, Indonesian, and Asian restaurants, and all offered delicious food paired with fantastic cocktails. The in-room dining menu, though limited, was sufficient for quick bites. However, we felt the absence of more Indian cuisine options, which could enhance the overall dining experience for Indian travelers like us. 4. Spa (10/10) The spa was one of the highlights of our stay. From the front desk to the therapists, everything was flawless. The treatments were incredibly relaxing and left us feeling rejuvenated. Truly one of the best spa experiences we've ever had! Just ensure booking in advance as they're mostly always booked! 5. Room for Improvement – Front Desk (6/10) While most of the staff were exemplary, our check-in experience was disappointing. The staff member assisting us lacked professionalism and, at one point, made an inappropriate remark about our Indian accent. Such behavior is unacceptable, especially from the staff of a property as prestigious as Merusaka. We hope the management takes steps to ensure that all guests feel equally respected and welcomed. Overall Rating: 8.8/10 Merusaka Resort offers a near-perfect blend of luxury, comfort, and Balinese charm. The serene atmosphere, excellent villa amenities, world-class spa, and outstanding butler service far outweighed the minor setbacks. We would highly recommend Merusaka Resort to anyone looking for a peaceful and luxurious stay in Nusa Dua. With a few improvements in their front desk staff training, this property could easily become a flawless retreat. Thank you, Merusaka, for an unforgettable experience!"
"300.","Clive Prescott","91","2025-03-02","3","Poor check-in. Lack of guidance. Queued for over an hour in baking heat and told off for drinking some water we found in a conference room. The welcome drink was an awful tasting cold tea. When asked if we could have water, we were told no. Got our room key around 3pm after waiting from 9am and then didn't get the cases until 3.55. Shower not working and fixed the next day only to find it not working properly two days later. Given some fruit as compensation. Staff very friendly"
"301.","Shihab Ansari Azhar","145","2023-12-30","4","I stayed at this hotel for three nights in July and I have to admit that I went in to the hotel with really low expectations. Perhaps that is why I was very impressed and blow away! The first thing that you notice, besides the pleasant and calm lobby, is the welcoming service. Throughout my stay, I had the most wonderful service from everybody, from the front desk staff to the restaurant staff to the concierge. The only issue with the service was the overwhelming rush during breakfast, and consequently there were delays with coffee orders and the like - but nothing too significant. I had read most of the reviews of the hotel on Google Maps before traveling so the first thing I did upon getting to the room was to check the air conditioning - and it worked fine! I noticed that there was some water dripping from the A/C but not a significant amount by any stretch of the imagination - just a few drops and nothing that bothered me. The only issue I felt with the A/C was the position relative to the bed - the A/C blows perpendicular to the bed and so it gets a bit warm on the left edge of the bed. Management may want to consider changing the layout of the rooms to make sure the A/C blows towards the bed. The rooms are spacious and while the furniture is a bit old it is clean and comfortable. The bathroom is unbelievably spacious - the fittings are modern and work well. I sadly didn’t even use the third of the bathroom that contains the tub. The food and drinks at the hotel were, to my surprise, extremely good. Whether it was the buffet for breakfast or the lunch at the downstairs cafe, the food was cooked well and very tasty. Prices are also reasonable and portions are large. I didn’t get to experience the pool or the gym on this trip as I was there for a conference, but the Merusaka was a great stay, and one I would recommend."

The rooms were spacious and well designed though it could do with a minor cosmetic uplift. Service was always attentive and friendly. The hotel has 3 restaurants onsite and provided enough food and drinks variety for a long stay. The hotel is kid friendly (excellent diving board for both kids and adults). For the shopaholics, Bali Collection shopping centre is in close walking proximity. We will be back if we manage to secure a similar deal again."

Negative - Whole resort looks very tired & not well maintained - Ice cream station at beach bar not friendly and whole area super filthy and used ice cream sticks all over and creating even more ants - Beach bar filled with flies all over the drinks preparation area - Kitchen team not able to manage crowd. Food and drinks can wait up till 30mins in peak timing - Room Shower head & basin tap needs changing - No sound proof for the rooms, can hear loud and clear on what’s happening outside - Breakfast buffet is not good - too many kids & family around. Not very relaxing + not very mature resort. Positive - Spacious bathroom, clean pool - Nice beach - Wifi easily connected around whole resort even at beach area, very stable and smooth - Aircon nice and cool in rooms - Bed very large & comfortable mattress - Water heater heats up quick, nice and hot - Housekeeping is good - 3 restaurants food is decent at least - Staff friendly - Bali Collection is lovely mall - gym is nice and spacious In conclusion, just whole resort super tired. Don’t believe the pictures you see. I definitely won’t be returning. Coming from Singapore, only 2 hours plane to here, I come Bali ALOT! And this is by far, most disappointing resort :( oh well. To Singaporeans reading this review, hope you can consider other resort."

"310.","Kelsey A","155","2025-03-02","4","Pros * Beautiful hotel and clean * A few different restaurants to try with vegetarian options. * All-inclusive breakfast caters to many people. Has bakery items, cheese, meat, sushi, ramen, Indian food like roti and masala, yogurt, fruit, multiple egg options, and more! It’s also very delicious * The staff have been very attentive and kind * Don’t have to pay to use beach chairs * Sand is soft and clean * Multiple pools to choose from * One pool has a swim-up bar * The resort is accessible for those that may be in a wheel chair as there are ramps to choose instead of stairs. * Free bottles of water in the room but nothing else. * TVs have Netflix loaded on them if you feel you want to watch tv * Umbrellas are available for use in the lobby if you need * It has AC * Has a safe * Rooms are spacious Cons * If you are on the beach, drinks are not offered to you, however you can go up to the bar and bring them over but most people didn’t * There was construction happening so unfortunately when you were by the pool it took away from the relaxation * The rooms are noisy!! This was the biggest downfall for me. We had a neighbour on one side blasting Justin Bieber and the other had children who would scream every night. Not relaxing in that aspect. * You can’t control the temperature in the room. It’s set to 21 and we tried turning it down for sleeping and it didn’t do a thing. One night we woke up and our room was 26 degrees. * The food at breakfast isn’t properly labelled in terms of what ingredients it contains. For example, it would say “mixed sushi” or “mixed sandwhiches” and there was no indication if something contained, meat, fish, etc. Turn up volume to listen to video. It is while we are trying to relax in our room and can hear kids next door"

The private beach at the hotel was beautiful with calm and swimmable waters. The staff was very polite and helpful and kept sending us goodies all along. Overall a very luxurious experience and worth the money."

Poor maintenance. Some areas of the Hotel are poorly maintained, for a 5 star hotel."
"317.","Yanis","8","2024-12-30","4","Great experience. The resort is located by the beachfront and aims to bring an experience where you don’t have to worry about anything. Ours was a little bit different however. We first got assigned the 2109 room with King-size bed and pool next to the room. The room in itself was gorgeous with great amenities, comfy bed and spacious room. However the biggest setback was the soundproofing that was VERY bad. The fact that we had noisy neighbours obviously did not help but even small conversations in the hallway were very noisy because of the bad sound insulation. We had a rough first night Fortunately, when the guest relations department was made aware of our experience, they did everything they could to better our stay. They changed our room to what seems like a renovated one and apologized for this experience. Since then, our stay has been wonderful. The breakfast provides a lot of options, from pancakes, waffles to American-style, Indonesian-style etc… The various restaurants are also great, the pools are very big, beautiful and calm and the whole resort is overlooking the private beach on which you can just sit back and relax. The best of the Merusaka experience is definitely the Service that will do everything to provide you with the best experience possible. All in all I would recommend staying at Merusaka Nusa Dua if you get the chance, but to be very wary of the sound proofing of the room you’ll get."

"321.","Nikola Lefterov","13","2024-12-30","1","The beach was so dirty that it was not suitable for any water activities. The swimming pool was super hot and not comfortable to stay in. Restaurant: Even though we had booked all-inclusive, there were many things that were charged extra. The surcharge was about 5 to 10 euros, which is not an issue, but the food was really poor quality and we had many stomach problems. There are no night activities if you are young. You have nothing to do there after 23:00. Everything is closing and you cannot even have a drink. In general, there is bad hygiene, poor quality food, and it is absolutely boring. This was my worst vacation so far. I even ended it before the planned time."
"322.","Samantha Wadlow-Evans","43","2022-12-30","5","Beautiful setting with easy access to pools and the crystal blue beach. Staff are lovely, rooms are perfect. Breakfast buffet is amazing with plenty of choices to suit a variety of palettes. Made to order omelettes and banana pancakes. Perfect location for families, singles, couples and friends. A choice to relax on your own deck and your own pool or by one of the other pools or our own beach in front of the hotel. It's also away from the hustle and bustle of the busy part of Bali but only a short taxi ride into town. I would definitely go back and recommend this to everyone."

Tamu2 hotel ini 70% lebih adalah WNA turis yg berlibur..malu bgt sebagai WNI melihat antrian ini, Pdahal ini hotel top off the line BUMN Indonesia. Kami mengantri seperti antrian sembako murah. Padahal rate hotel di saat itu 2 jt ke atas"

"326.","Amariah Hinze","7","2023-12-30","5","Rooms were amazing! Loved the pools by our bedside and walking to multiple pools around the resort not to mention the beach by the pools! Location- 40 minutes from all tourist destinations. Service is amazing- they speak so well to us and treat us like family! We wanted to make a special thank you to the pool bar staff for always making our day."
"327.","Louise Egan","84","2023-12-30","5","We booked as an all inclusive deal on Luxury Escapes and went in with realistic expectations - we loved our stay! Yes some parts were a little dated and the room wasn't spotless but our aircon worked fine, shower was decent and the bed was huge and very comfortable. Restaurants were great, staff were very attentive and really helpful with providing vegan options. Pools were a highlight, very clean and not too busy despite the hotel being fully booked. You have to get in early if you want a sun lounger around the pool though. All interactions were easy and pretty seamless. Staff were quick to provide extra bottles of water when we called reception. Taxi service was good. Beach was very clean and well maintained. We would definitely stay again."
"328.","Le Duy","4","2025-03-02","1","This is one of the worst service i have ever gotten in my entire life!!! And yes, i have stayed at 3 or even 2 hotels before. Employee are soo unprofessional i had a hard time believing that they work in hospitality: 1. unable to meet the checkin timeline. They just told me to seat and wait til they contact on WhatsApp. But after 1 and a half hours, which I believe is plenty of times to prepare the room, there is still nothing. The checkin time has already past half an hour ago, but the only answer i got when i go to ask was wait?!! This is not how a 5 star hotel should treat customer. I HAS NOT RECEIVED ANY APOLOGY OR EXPLANATION for this!!! 2. When I ask for way to travel outside (since this is a big hotel and it is probably more than 1km from our stay), the receptionist just glared at me and said you can book taxi?! Like is that even allowed? Is that how you treat your customer? I only asked because i saw the electric car, hoping that they will give me explanation on how to use or order it!! 3. After i confront them about the stay, they gave me the key to the room and tell me to wait for someone to escort me to the room and well, it has been another 15mins since, who would have guessed that, right? 4. And the reason why i let it all out on this review, was because we are not the only ones, there are other people have to wait in the lobby like us as well after AN HOUR past the checkin time! I really hope to never come across this kind of hotel again, not only it pisses me off, but it made me feels like wasting my money on “5-star” treatment."

"330.","Meenal Garg","179","2024-12-30","5","I don't have enough good things to say about this place. Located in the beautiful Nusa Dua area, this amazing resort has a great private beach with lots of chairs and umbrellas, so many pools(!), restaurants that offer many cuisines, polite and friendly staff and great hospitality. Many rooms have direct pool access, it is kid friendly and they have great breakfast options. They had a fun pool party on Sunday which we enjoyed. The Nusa Dua area has good water sports and is close to Bali Collection. However, depending on the things you want to enjoy in Bali, take a look at the distances. I highly recommend this place to make your vacation perfect."
"331.","S L Chong","2132","2023-12-30","5","We stayed here for a night and enjoyed our stay. Despite the furnishings being a little dated and some issues with air-conditioning, the room was large and comfortable. The bathroom was equipped with both shower and large bathtub. Check in and out were fast with no issues. The nearest shops are at Bali Collection and there is an hourly free shuttle. The breakfast restaurant has many varieties of local food and all the staff were very pleasant. The are several swimming pools but the best part is the clean and private beach that is part of the hotel. It was windy and relaxing at the beach."
"332.","Brenda Charlottha","74","2024-12-30","5","The hotel itself is undeniably nice, and the beach area is well-maintained. I liked the room ambience a lot, especially the bathroom. One notable drawback was the distance between the ballroom and the rooms. I found it rather inconvenient, especially when attending events or functions although the hotel did provide buggy car service to bridge this gap, it was a a thoughtful touch. The menu boasted a diverse range of choices, however the dishes were somewhat lackluster, and while they weren't outright unpleasant, they didn't leave a lasting impression."
"333.","SSS Auto Detailing Semarang","87","2024-12-30","3","Nginep sini waktu Nyepi 2023. Overall fasilitas dan keamanan hotel oke, tapi, mungkin kudu dibenahi sistem dan flow nya ketika okupansi sangat tinggi. Jadi ketila proses check in ataupun check out tidak terjadi antrian yg sangat mengular. Begitu juga untuk resto saat breakfast dan dinner, untuk bisa diperhatikan lagi kebersihan dan kerapihan makanannya. Jujur rada kaget waktu breakfast kondisi nya se chaos itu, jadi experience nya kayak lagi ngantri makanan di kondangan. Food stall banyak yg telat refill, alat makan telat juga. Sayang aja semua sudah bagus dan enak tp ada experience yg kurang greget."
"334.","amandeep bhalla","91","2023-12-30","4","Great experience staying at this massive property just before Christmas. Service is very welcoming and good to stay with kids. Buffet offers a wide variety of cuisines. The room AC was not very effective, the sink has some issues with water standing in it and the fan did not work properly. The tour and travel offers decent packages but it's expensive that what is being offered outside through other agents so double check before you book. Right on the beach with clean waters and couple of big pools with public access."
"335.","Anastasia","16","2024-12-30","2","This hotel is so far away from 5 stars. Facilities are so old and not clean ,service is bad. Breakfast is terrible : mostly Indonesian food but not even good quality,no chicken at all. I wouldn’t suggest to stay here to anyone for the price they’re offering. I’m so disappointed. I’ve booked 2 nights and after I came immediately ask to cancel the second night but they refused. They made me stay in this place which is also weird and sad. Will never come back"
"336.","Lizzy Taylor","27","2023-12-30","5","This place is INCREDIBLE!!!! I have been to Bali 5 times and this is by far the best place I have stayed. The beach is clean and private, the pools are amazing, the food is excellent and so many options, the spa is great and the staff are so friendly and amazing. We are staying in a villa and having our own private pool that can be opened up to an even larger one, all a short walk to a perfect white beach is truly incredible. I am surprised by some of the other reviews. Who cares if the sun lounger isn’t brand new when you have pools and a pristine beach all at your fingertips at a very reasonable price? Priorities! Will definitely be back to Merusaka."

We did the all inclusive route which was great. Lots of selection and fast service. We enjoyed a massage at the spa which was fabulous. The grounds are beautiful. We did a family photoshoot with the professional photographer. It was such a fun experience and our photos turned out beautiful. They even edited any people from the background for us. We swam in both pools and the ocean as well. There is a free shuttle that takes you to Bali Collection for shopping, nail salons, and restaurant options. Overall, we had a lovely family trip at this resort! Suksma 🌺🤍"

"343.","Hani Lukito","28","2024-12-30","4","Had a enjoyable stay at Merusaka with my family. Our room is big enough with shared pool with other 4 rooms in a row. The one I like the most is they have their own private beach that is clean and not as crowded. The only downside was during breakfast time on the 23 Dec 2023. The staff insisted that I need to pay for extra breakfast for my kid cos she is 7 yo. Even I’ve told her I’ve paid for everything she was insisting with that until she finally checked the system. I wish she can check it first before passing that comment as if we sneaked in to breakfast area without aware of that. I understand that the breakfast area was quite packed and full but for a five-star hotel, I expect a more decent hospitality."

The breakfast restaurant is insane, so many crazy Russian who go into breakfast restaurant with bikini and that’s allowed meanwhile i didn’t see something like that in other 5stars hotel/resort because usually there’s rules for that. The direct pool from our room also so small, totally different from online picture."

Memang saking grande dan leganya hotel ini, jarak jalan kaki ke lobby atau sekadar ingin makan pagi jadi cukup lumayan. Apalagi tatkala hujan, tidak semua akses pedestriannya rain-free, serta ada beberapa bagian jalan yang tidak rata/drainase tidak lancar sehingga agak menggenang dan sulit dilewati tatkala hujan."
"347.","Devina Walsh","17","2024-12-30","5","We stayed here for 6 nights and we absolutely loved this hotel. The room we had was lovely (my son loved the bath), all the staff were very nice and facilities were great. The pools are amazing!! If you want the chilled and relaxed pool, you can go to the tiered infinity ones. But if you want the lively atmosphere one, you can go to the one by the beach ! (Also they have foam party in this pool every sunday. So much fun!) And they also have 2 kiddies pools. We enjoyed the kids club too! Ms Rai, Ms Putri and Ms Nanik were amazing. We went to the kids club nearly everyday when we stayed there and my son looooved it. Food were beautiful. They have 3 restaurants and we had dinner in every one of them. All amazing. Breakfast time was the busiest time as this hotel is huuge. But breakfast was superb. Lots of selection. The hotel is very exclusive as its in ITDC complex. The beach is lovely and clean. The only downside is the wifi was a little bit poor though and i wish they have outdoor playground for the kids. Overall we enjoyed our stay here and we’ll be back !"
"348.","ALBERTO CUCCO","21","2025-03-02","2","Thanks for leaving us without airconditioning for 4/5 nights. We reported air-conditioning not working on the second day we arrived, 2 technician came pressed a few buttons, airconditioning still not working. Being away most of the day from the hotel and coming back late night, we were only able to check if airconditioning was working at night, but of course, too late to change room..so we ended up not having proper airconditioning for 4 nights out of 5....Finally, on the last night they placed a portable airconditioning"
"349.","Alex K","15","2024-12-30","3","First time I saw such a poorly arranged service. Location and facilities are reasonably good, but we always struggled with service. Bright examples: new years eve and half the wine list is not available. Is new year dinner you promote should rely on old stock, or you should stock up? Leaking AC. They came to fix it 3 times and leaked next day again. Do you like to sleep with dripping water? Come here. In the positive side: Great pool jumping deck. Fantastic new year open air party, nice and cozy pool bar."

Great selections of food at breakfast. The beach was otherworldly enchanting. I'd suggest everyone who wishes to have a fulfilling and pleasant leisure time in Bali to stay at Merusaka. It should be everyone's go-to place if he wishes to avoid the hustle and bustle of Kuta and its adjacent areas. Would love to come back here on our upcoming Bali trip in the near future. ✨✨✨✨✨"
"356.","Vasiliki Totsis","2","2024-12-30","2","Rooms have very dim lighting which makes it difficult to look for things as you need to use a phone light for backup. I’m very unhappy with the communication from the staff at the main lobby. At no time do they elaborate on activities/passes/allowances upon check in. You are handed your key etc and sent away. For eg, free photo shoot - you are not advised to book when you check in. Another eg, you order a taxi, the concierge quote a price, and then the drive argues about entry fees. And dare you ask for a glass of water with ice…you need to pay for a barely chilled bottle of water. Would I personally recommend staying here? As a resort it is impeccably beautiful however front desk staff need further hospitality education."
"357.","Okan Bostan","1122","2024-12-30","5","Our roundtrip through Java and Bali ended at the beautiful Merusaka Hotel. Finally we had the chance to relax and to enjoy staying at one single place. Today I am glad we have chosen this premium hotel in Nusa Dua. The check in procedure happened flawlessly with professional staff that knew how to treat customers in a very welcoming way. From the first moment onwards the hotel offered us its beautiful and large pools. Once in our spacious rooms we were extremely happy to be able to take a relaxing shower. The rooms were equipped with the most important amenities such as a safe, a fridge and a flawlessly working aircon. The bathrooms had not only a shower but also a stand-alone bathtub. The surroundings of the rooms are well maintained and covered with greenery. The ground floor rooms had a private pool, too. The hotel offers several restaurants with large menu selections. The beach is accessible directly from the hotel garden and food / beverages can be ordered to the long chairs by the beach. What we loved is the staff's professional work attitude. Very polite, smiling and helpful at all times and fast serving. The food in any restaurant was delicious and beyond. If you want to take a timeout you can book your holidays at this hotel with no hesitation. You won't regret it. If I have to criticise something it's only room doors which slam and make a huge noise if you do not hold the door to close. I think this could be solved easily by a handyman. Anything else was perfect! Thank you Merusaka for having us and giving us the chance to rejuvenate for one week. And a very big thanks to the staff! You definitely make a difference! Terima Kasih!"

Asked for a couple of items and it took about an hour to be delivered. Hotel provides complimentary photo session which was a really bad experience, as we stayed for a few days and post getting to know about the same when we contacted the person, all slots during our stay were booked. This kind of reflected bad and was not a good experience for us."
"362.","Christoffer Shokofan Taudien","67","2023-12-30","3","A huge hotel with rooms for 800 guests right on the beach, the hotel has a bit of a charter atmosphere about it. The hotel has huge free areas for walking and creates a pleasant atmosphere that we liked. The breakfast has a lot of variety, but for us it feels too messy when 100s of guests have to go all in.. if you choose a villa or a suite, you get your own area for breakfast with different content and slightly better service, but above all calm and quiet. There are nice pools with different surfaces depending on whether you want to be private or not. What we don't like is the morning race to reserve a sunbed with a towel, gives an inharmonious atmosphere, if only the guests had the sense to remove the towels when you left for the day, it would give an automatic seat rotation. The beach promenade is very nice. We liked the the walking distance to Bali Collection, a small center with shopping and restaurants. What a terrible check in experience, after a 30h journey.. all you want is to get to the room and sleep.. our experience took 30 minutes.. papers to be sorted, printed, signed in wads if seemed a very cumbersome process : Can't you just prepare all the papers or take the passport and do the administration the next day? We also had a room change planned, which did not go well. Very little coordination between the staff and unclear and conflicting instructions to us. But overall we are satisfied."
"363.","Chris Budiman","61","2023-12-30","4","Cozy hotel with access to beach and semi-private swimming pool just at the back of each room. However, the property needs upgrading, bathroom lights need to be brighter, amenities needs to be checked to make sure sufficient supplies for each night. I enjoyed the bike rental but haven't had the chance to enjoy the other facilities such as table tennis and beach voll dined in one of the three dining places, Gading Restaurant. The food is delicious and the service is above expectation. Overall, it was a pleasant stay."

"365.","Hiraash Thawfeek","115","2023-12-30","4","Overall a very good hotel located in one of the best beaches in Bali. It’s attached to the Nusa Dua beach at one of the best locations. Depending on the time you go the sea could be very calm and shallow or even quite rough. Great place to chill and take a dip. Fairly good for surfing as well. The hotel itself is old but refurbished and looks quite new. Rooms are quite large with good quality amenities. The view from the rooms are just other rooms - not so great. The reason I rate the rooms and the hotel less than 5 star is because there was construction happening during our stay and it was very noisy. Not acceptable to have this during a holiday. It started quite early in the day and went on for the most part. Food at the main restaurant was mostly mediocre. Spread for breakfast was quite food with a number of options. Didn’t find anything super great. The bar at the beach and the Ja’jar restaurant were pretty good. They both had good menus and the food was quite delicious. We had number of meals there. The staff are super friendly, kind and helpful. This is one of the good things about this place and in general Bali. They are pretty quick to respond to requests and cheerful all the time. Good vibes to be around. All in all I would come here again but I would check about the construction as this complain has been there before as well."

"371.","Rhiannon Weight","11","2024-12-30","1","Although Merusaka appears to be a beautiful Hotel it was far from the experience we had. Day 1 Husband was sick with food poisoning, the second day I was sick with food poisoning. This knocked us out for the 3nights we stayed and we barely left our room. Had to get a doctor in twice because of how sick we were. Because of this the last 3 days of our vacation was spent in bed or over a toilet. Add it to Hotels Response - love that you take no responsibility in your reply. It was most definitely the food we ate at the hotel as we only ate and drank from your hotel. Yes it can take up to 8hrs to show symptoms but can also show with a few hours. Even if it was 8hrs still had been eating at the hotel. Dr was pretty certain it was also from the food we ate here."

The gym is terrible only one person can train in the weights area I would give it a 1 star. If you need a gym to train in do not stay here you will be disappointed. Also it was pouring with rain and they would not open prior to 6.00am when I asked the Desk clerk who said he was the manager he told me access was on a timer. Pools are great. I have stayed in Bali 8 times this is the least favourite. The only exceptions being fantastic service Food is reasonable and the Pools are excellent."

"377.","Sandra Hutchinson","7","2023-12-30","5","We booked a great deal on Luxery Escapes months ago and then saw some fairly negative reviews so thought - well you get what you pay for. We have been extremely impressed by everything, the staff have been wonderful, we have our room adjoining and they are the only two rooms for our private pool. Just perfect. The few times we had an issue it was fixed promptly. A special mention of the Sunday Beach BBQ we did , we cannot remember the staff names but their service was so good - not to mention the food - well worth doing if you are there on a Sunday. We downloaded the Bluebird app and found the taxis are very cheap , plus we did a few day trips but we loved the quiet of Nusa Dua to come back to at the end of the day. Highly recommend ."

Early morning you can witness a beautiful sunrise from the beach and hear the chirping of birds that is so majestic. I'm giving this property as a 2.5/5, only because of our bad experience with the management. A well maintenance checks should be their primary responsibility before guest's check in. We had to constantly check with the reception desk as AC was not functioning properly. Though the service was quick but of no help. We booked our rooms which was upgraded to the new room but later we were asked to shift to a different room as the AC was not running. It was very hot and disappointing to see that we paid for the stay wondering to make beautiful memories turn out not so good. Later, a complimentary cake was sent by the manager itself as a token of apology. Which was a good gesture."
"379.","Tetiana Gavrylova","40","2024-12-30","5","Very neat and cosy hotel, super polite stuff and amazing location. The hotel was chosen for a military event for 1000 people during our stay, and generally it was very busy with different conferences. The beach is wide and nice, there is enough space for all guests so nobody fights for a spot under the sun. We got a free photoshoot as a gift from the hotel and were able to schedule it last minute. Photos exceeded our expectations!"
"380.","Katherine Cummings Szeto","122","2023-12-30","3","Our Villa was lovely, as well as our pool and the lagoon adjacent to it! We swam in them each day. People were friendly and especially food service personnel were friendly to us! Service was often slow or nonexistent and some things were very confusing. For example, when we checked in we never got our luggage number or our room key and no explanation as to when we would so we had to hunt those down later. Sometimes we would text a request and a text would come back two hours later. Photo shoot was wonderful! Tea time and happy hour were wonderful and the food service professionals were fabulous. Overall a bit too expensive for what was offered/ provided for our honeymoon package."

"384.","Calvin Yeo","41","2024-12-30","5","Merusaka Nusa Dua is a beachfront resort in a serene, somewhat rural area, about a 10-minute walk from the nearest local eateries. The staff are friendly, though not exceptional, while the breakfast is impressive, offering a wide variety of choices. The rooms show some signs of age but opting for the pool access unit makes a significant difference, providing direct entry to the pool—a feature particularly enjoyed by children. Overall, Merusaka Nusa Dua offers a pleasant stay for those seeking a peaceful beachfront escape, despite a few minor drawbacks related to location and room condition."
"385.","Aziza Nur Dewi Nirmalasari","227","2025-03-02","5","The room is spacious and clean. There are some complementaries missing such as coffee machine and free drinks in fridge, but so far it is all great. Two room keys are provided, one already attached to the room when checking in, so we enter a cooled room. Recently here since 2 years ago, the resort has some improvement, like the amenities is changed to pump one, which i loved due to its bigger content and better quality. The sofa inside the room is also new. The coffee is in form of a bag. What irritates me is the pool employee, it was stated that it is open from 7am to 7pm, yet, on 6pm, vacant pool bed cushions were collected early, umbrella were closed. Hmm, they should've done that when the pool are closed. Starting early on tidying up makes the guest around the pool feel like being evicted, and make the recent coming to pool guest is sitting on non-cushioned bed."

"387.","budiono tri","25","2025-03-30","4","A serene retreat best suited for families seeking calm over chaos. If you're young, wild, and restless—this isn’t your playground. It’s not where memories are made; it’s where they’re slowed down. The beach? Effortlessly accessible. One of my personal favorites for a lazy afternoon with toes in the sand and time on your side. It invites you to do absolutely nothing, and that’s the point. The mega pool is a highlight—expansive, shallow in all the right places, perfect for your little ones to splash safely while you sip something cool and watch the world fade. Now, the food. Let’s just say it won’t start a fire in your soul. The flavors play it safe, perhaps too safe. But venture out—Bali’s real culinary magic lives beyond the hotel gates. And lastly, the service. Warm, attentive, never overbearing. The staff make you feel like you belong, without ever overstaying their welcome. In short: come here to rest, not to rave. It’s peace with a view."
"388.","Bobby Calmer","3","2022-12-30","5","My wife and I had an incredible 3 night stay here (we wish it could’ve been longer). The staff here were exceptionally kind, generous, and accommodating to us (they always seemed to go above and beyond for everyone). We had their Lilin romantic dinner here and it was a breathtaking experience. The resort is of exceptional quality: they keep the grounds manicured and the room very tidy. The spa was a pleasurable experience, breakfast had many delicious options for everyone to enjoy. We ate at all the restaurants and the food and drinks were always superb. We would highly recommend this resort to others and we hope to come back in the future!"
"389.","Andreas Ebner","4","2022-12-30","5","Really enjoyed our stay! The rooms are clean and in a decent shape. Service was kind and what you'd expect in a big hotel of this class. Breakfast buffet offered anything you could wish for with a huge variety. What made our stay perfect was the beach view, pools and above all the pool bar! Only the gym was very outdated and in a poor shape (considering a high class hotel). Also outside the hotel (10 minutes walk) there are some nice shops and great restaurants at a decent price. Would come back anytime!"
"390.","Amy Herbert","28","2022-12-30","5","Beautiful resort! We stayed at the Merusaka for 4 nights on our recent stay in Bali and the resort was lovely! Nice pools, right on the beach which was perfect and the staff were all so friendly - especially Made who made us feel very welcome on our first night, showing us to our room and around the resort. The room was very big and clean, and comfortable bed. Good food selection at buffet breakfast, especially the omelettes - best omelette I have ever had! I would recommend this resort to others!"
"391.","Dinda Suriadiredja","6","2023-12-30","3","Of the several hotels we have visited in the Nusa Dua area, this was the first time we had an unpleasant experience. Initially we booked a deluxe room for 3 days 2 nights. Then we asked to upgrade to direct pool access for an additional 1 million/2 nights. However, the rooms is not like 5 star hotel and we couldn't enjoy the room. In front of our pool there was a very noisy reconstruction going on from morning to 18.00 which only stopped at lunch. We also found there were nails scattered at the bottom of the pool. With so many workers, it also made it impossible for me and my daughter to swim because they would see it. Apart from that, breakfast is varied, the main swimming pool is quite pleasant, staff service is quite good"

"394.","Christopher","53","2023-12-30","5","Huge, beautiful resort, and very professional and friendly staff. Was actually impressed on the size of the hotel area, and on the size of the rooms. The swimming pool area is very kids friendly as well with a lot of variety for pool depth that suits all age of kids. There's morning and night market stalls selling Balinese trinkets along the walking passage to the rooms, which just add an extra traditional Balinese atmosphere to it. Beach was a bit of a letdown to be honest as it wasn't as clean as we expected, and the lobby area can be a bit of a chaos everytime we're waiting for our pick-ups/ friend given the huge number of traffic that went by there. But it doesn't take away anything from the overall wonderful experience. Will we go back again if given the chance when we're in Nusa Dua area? Definitely yes"
"395.","Vlad Enachescu","2","2023-12-30","3","The hotel looks nice in the photos, but in reality needs a lot of refurbish: the paint from the building felt down, the room are big, nothing to comment, but needs some renovation, the beach towels are from the previous century and so on. Breakfast has a few option regarding international cuisine, but it is ok for the local food point of view. The gym in fact is nothing else that 2 rooms with 2 treadmill and 2 bicycles, plus some heavy weights. Definitely not a real gym. The area it is very well secured, it is very safe, but somehow the tourist are trapped in this area - Bali Collection is an outside shopping mall nearby, with some restaurants, but with higher prices then regular Bali. The beach is private - good point - and it's nice. People are a bit lazy but in the end the services are decent. Definitely not a 5 stars hotel, rather a 3 to 4 stars experience."
"396.","Novita Wu","271","2024-12-30","5","Nice hotel to stay, spacious rooms. Family friendly. Aesthetics Bali standard. You can walk over the beach and connect yourself with other hotels.

"399.","Cherry Wibisono","27","2023-12-30","5","If you are travelling with small children, I highly recommend this hotel. I booked the 2 bedroom suites and I have no complaints. The room is exactly as advertised with a convenient access to a pool, perfect for a morning lap or quick splash with the kids. There's a living room area where the kids can play around freely without being cooped up in the bedroom. We have a butler assigned to us, who contacted us after our checkout because we left some personal items and offered to get it delivered. Huge resorts with private beach access and multiplr swimming pools to choose from. Plus point, there's a kids club with friendly staffs and all sorts of activities to entertain the children."

However, the room we're staying in looks and feels old which can be understood considering the quiet covid time and they probably just reopened the resort by the time we're staying. The deep cleaning of the room could be done a bit better, it was a little bit dusty on the furniture here and there, but not that bad. Staff were super friendly and all smiles (especially the front desk who checked us in and accommodated our request of having 1 king size bed instead of twin beds put together), very helpful and welcoming. I would recommend getting the room with pool access too."

"409.","Naudita Olivia","104","2024-12-30","5","I had an enjoyable stay at Merusaka Nusa Dua, situated in a strategic location within the Nusa Dua ITDC Area, and it's just a short walk to Bali Collection, where numerous restaurants and shops are available. The lobby's view was stunning, and there's direct access to the beach at the back of the hotel. They also have a jogging track. Merusaka Nusa Dua features several on-site restaurants, a gym, and each building has its own pool for ground-level rooms. To reach your room, you either walk or call a buggy, and each building has its own lift. Despite being of the same type, some rooms have different interiors. The rooms are spacious with a sofa, and the adjustable AC keeps it cool. However, achieving a bright room at night can be challenging. The bathroom is also spacious and includes a bathtub. The hotel has two pool areas, with one featuring a diving platform at two heights. The breakfast offers plenty of choices, though the sushi needs improvement, as it was plain, salty, and lacked protein. The gym has decent equipment with sufficient amenities. The meeting room is spacious, and they provide great snacks. While the lunch menu is amazing, the taste falls short. Dinner, priced at IDR750.000/USD50, is considered too expensive. Despite some minor drawbacks, I genuinely enjoyed my stay and would consider returning for both business and vacation purposes."

We also had a room with a pool right outside the balcony you could step into anytime, so indulgent : ) loved it.

Ketika mobil mau saya pakai pun, tim vallet saling melempar tugas (saya tau karna saya mendengarkan mereka berbicara di HT) 2. Dinding kamar lembab, banyak cat mengelupas di kamar saya 1107 3. Kami memesan kamar dengan layanan private pool access, tapi kolam renang tsb airnya kotor, lantai dasar kolam renang pun kotor. Tidak ada filter menyala, otomatis air pun pasti tidak terfilter sama sekali, 2 malam saya menginap, kolam renang sama sekali tidak di maintenance. 4. Malam terakhir sebelum kami check out, saya pergi keluar ber2 dengan istri, anak kami bersama dgn susternya dikamar, kami pesankan makanan lewat gra*, makanannya sampai di hotel, oleh suster kami lobby hotel di telp, jawabannya nanti dikabarin apakah makanannya sudah datang apa belum (sedangkan dari aplikasi kami, makanan tsb sudah sampai diterima oleh lobby), tapi 30 menit tak kunjung di telp ulang oleh lobby, ketika di telp ulang, jawabannya masih sama, di cek dikabarin. Oleh istri saya di telp lobby nya (dari nomor telp biasa karna kami sedang diluar, kami sempat menegur kenapa tidak dikirim2, jawabannya, ada antrian).

Pros: - Rooms with access to the pool - Both a bathroom and a shower - Good safe in the room - Enough drinking water in the room (but in glass, so it’s not for taking away to the beach, etc.) - Good cleaning - Regular change of towels and linen - Friendly staff - Delicious food in Homaya restaurant (Indonesian cuisine) and Ja’Jan bistro (seafood soup highly recommended) - Beautiful territory - 2 big pools - A sufficient number of sunbeds at the beach - 10 minutes walking from Bali Collection Cons: - Difficulty of communication: they answer for too long, and each type of service has its own phone number (I have 5 different contacts in WA, though I asked only for transfer and SPA) - Disgusting breakfasts; poor choice of food, especially European cuisine, fruits, vegetables, pastries… - Empty mini-bar in the room - The smell of sewage in the bathroom, the water in the shower is standing and does not go away - The lighting in the room and bathroom is terrible - The wardrobe has one door: 1/2 of the cabinet with its content is always in sight, and the light is always on in the closet - Seaweed at the beach is buried in the sand - Untasty food in the restaurant at the beach (Ja’Jan by the sea) and in the main restaurant (Gading), it corresponds with the Google rating - No imported beer in restaurants, only Bintang - Few sunbeds by the big pool - Very poor lighting in the WC nearby the big pool - Deposit requirement with a credit card (uneasy for Russians)"

At the buffet breakfast each morning, I would be asked if I had any special requests for the next day such as gluten free waffles, pancakes and bread I also had wonderful gluten free traditional Indonesian meals during my stay.

Wi-fi was very poor all the time, with frequent interruptions, and it didn’t matter where - on the hotel premises or in the room itself. To call via WhatsAp I had to use expensive roaming. Breakfast (buffet) was very bad - little choice and very tasteless. The hotel offers a short photo shoot around the property for $10 per photo. As a result, the photos are not even processed. This is already arrogance and rip-off. In addition, during my stay it was my 30th birthday. They didn't even offer me at least a free cocktail. Although they do have the option for everyone to get a free drink at the bar once. I simply did not drink this drink - it was worse than slop. Apart from a good location, this hotel has no advantages. And this is not 5 stars at all, but much worse. I do not advise."

What I loved: smart TV with netflix and youtube, guest services was very responsive to our needs. Since it is an old hotel it had high quality wooden furniture that's been maintained beautifully. But they changed out all the bathroom fittings, AC, and lighting so they're more modern. The hotel is very big with multiple pools and restaurants/lounges, lots of options. Some cons: there's quite a bit of a walk and some stairs from the lobby to the rooms. Unless you get on a buggy, accessibility may be an issue."

"435.","AB","24","2024-12-30","3","Nice hotel, food & staff are amazing too. The only downfall is the room. Its quiet depressing and not enjoyable. Need more lighting in the room and bathroom.room need a deep clean and dusting. staff cleaning the room amd bathroom need to have an eye for detail. Furnitures need a good dusting from bed, to wardrobe shelves. The tub is yucky there is a foul smell. I was refraining to let my 2 kids in. Bathroom tiles need a good scrub."

"443.","Mandeep Gill","3","2023-12-30","2","Location is great. Too expensive to be a 5 star hotel, as rooms air conditions are not working properly, water dribbling, even though our room was changed, but still experienced the same issues. Spa, beach area, location are great. Food is ok, but serving staff requires more training and coordination. Food manager is a gentle and professional lady with kind nature. But dinning area is below the expectations of 5 star hotel as compared to other places in Bali."

"445.","Jayden Gibson","34","2023-12-30","2","Where to start, on arrival everything was great, location is great but very secluded and no local shops. The room After our first night we had issues with our aircon not getting cold and faulting, bar fridge not getting cold, room smells like mould, was offered a replacement room. After issues again had to move 3 time over the time of 2 days This resort is by far not a 5 star resort more like 3 and not worth the money they ask very old and run down. There is better places in Bali to spend time and money the Bar tenders in the pool free pouring the cocktails making them un drinkable After back and forth with the manager I was given a refund to be told it take up to 2 months for the money to be returned. I would not recommend spending time or money here"

"447.","Ramesh Kooverjee","125","2023-12-30","4","We stayed at this place for 8 nights. The location is great, the resort's garden, pools etc is well maintained. We had a room that opens out to a pool. The room is spacious. However, we had to contend with luke warm showers for our entire stay. They tried to fix the issue but this did not work. The door to the fridge bar was also not closing well.The room was 2118. My advice is that you check the hot water when you get a room allocated so that you do not have a bad experience. On the plus side, the service was very good. To make up for the hot water issue, we had a spa room allocated for our shower for the last day (as we had a late flight)."

We forgot something at the resort and they helped coordinate and get it back to us :) but being a 5 star, we felt Rooms were not at 5 star level. Needed a lot of touch ups. Small things like kettle,phone etc were oddly placed. Service was delayed many times. Bathroom lighting was very dim and throughout had a weird sewer smell."
"452.","Akam Akangillio","91","2022-12-30","3","It was an great deal during Nyepi. It’s old resort but I like the architecture of the hotel, it is industrial, traditional mixed with nature. The room is so spacious has a bath tub and nice balcony with great views. The hotel has a nice swimming pool, access to beach a gym. For the breakfast, there is no much selection but it is a nice breakfast. Overall I satisfy with the hotel and and quite place. I will recommended if you get good deal"
"453.","Cale","3","2024-12-30","5","We had a fantastic stay at the Merusaka Hotel. Went with a luxury escapes all inclusive deal. Had 2 rooms booked. Got interconnecting rooms and a pool to ourselves. We were in room 4101 and 4102. Food was great. Breakfast was lots of options. Was an air-conditioned room but was busy most mornings. Pool bar was a great place to watch the endless belly flops off the diving platform. Good little surf break out the front of the hotel also. Will be back."

From the moment we set off, Beni's enthusiasm and knowledge about the area were truly inspiring. The scenic route took us through lush gardens, along pristine beaches, and even past some local cultural spots. The whole experience was the perfect blend of fitness and exploration 🏃🏖️ Highly recommend this activity to anyone staying at Merusaka!"
"456.","Natalie A","17","2023-12-30","1","This is not a family friendly resort at all. If you’re considering bringing your family, don’t. Kids club is terrible - a tiny room where the air con hardly works with a few old toys. No planned activities for the kids at all and only opened 9-5. It was too hot to leave the kids in there. The all inclusive menus were very limited. Buffet breakfast was average. Staff were friendly. The room was a good size. The other guests weren’t friendly at all. People don’t seem to like kids here even though it’s a “family resort”. Was made to feel extremely uncomfortable and threatened on a number of occasions. Would not stay here again."
"457.","David Zimmermann","33","2023-12-30","4","Wonderful resort. Excellent staff. Buffet breakfast is very nice👍. The only issue I had was that the Aircon in the room was blowing warm....staff came right away and tried to fix it 3 times, but it was still broke. Put a portable Aircon unit in the room. Was OK, and did the job. Otherwise, it was a wonderful stay."
"458.","ant_on_i","208","2023-12-30","4","The room was so clean, tidy, quiet and fresh. for the breakfast need more to be improved for the food variety and taste. housekeeping time need more be earlier, laundry team must be check in the morning so that the laundry bag can be picked up automatically without the guest ask to be picked up."
"459.","Milana Semenova","13","2023-12-30","3","Service is very bad. The most awful from thousand of hotels of our traveling. The money they take , is not worthy it at all. Our room has the strong smell of paint, asked to remove the smell for one and half day , no one does anything. Then I went to leader manager , and he was like , yes I know , there is art project next room… how this is possible in such hotel , hazarding client health. Secondly, Had the issue with my plane tickets , asked the girl at the reception about help which they can give to us, the girl LITERALLY yelled at me , and her face was so disgusted. And you call this service??? From pluses: rooms are big Great swimming pool Great beach But think twice before going to this hotel, because the relation from the reception is less than desired"
"460.","Julianne Mart","7","2022-12-30","2","Haven't even finished our stay and seriously considering going to a different hotel for the rest of our time on Bali. Front desk staff is rude and unhelpful. They treat even a simple request (like, can you call me a taxi?) as a huge inconvenience to them. Poorly designed hotel. All the restaurants only have outdoor seating so you eat outside even in the sweltering heat. Everything is really spread out so you have to take a hike just to get to breakfast. They have lots of private events on property so constant loud music even late at night. You eat at their restaurant onlooking like a private corporate event with a loud DJ. Or your kids are splashing in the pool ten feet from someone giving a wedding speech. Awkward. Rooms are great though. Unfortunately that didn't make up for all the downsides. Would never stay here again."
"461.","Sonia Padam","10","2023-12-30","2","This is our first o/s trip in 5 years and first with our 3yo and so far we are very disappointed. This is not a 5 star resort - more like 3. The rooms are very tired, very old, have lots of stains every and showers have some mould. There is also no where to unpack and store your clothes. There is literally just one shelf and a few hangers. That’s it. While the staff are friendly, the service is very slow. We are also not feeling that it is very family friendly so far. Other than the beach, which gets very hot, and the pool, there’s really nothing else for young kids to do. Other guests don’t seem to want kids around. Would not recommend this hotel, especially for families, and anyone looking for genuine 5 stars."
"462.","Dan Milne","11","2025-01-30","5","The Hotel is fantastic and the level of the service from the staff was some of the best in the industry, having stayed in various 5 star hotels across the world, the staff here provides the perfect balance of 5 star service.

We went during the Christmas vacation and the resort was fully occupied. Would recommend visiting during non-peak season to enjoy serenity"
"464.","Michael Alexander","73","2022-12-30","3","The bad: Room was never cleaned unless we asked, even when we had been out all day. Restaurants are quite expensive which is to be expected but the food is quite average. The buffet breakfast is large and ok, but the Indonesian food there is disgusting, some how all the flavour gets removed. Not enough pool chairs to, especially given the resort size. The good: staff were great, pool is amazing, beach is beautiful, the whole resort looks really nice. Plenty of great restaurants within walking distance. Bed and pillows were the most comfortable of our entire trip."
"465.","Dan Cornell","18","2024-12-30","4","Food and service are excellent. Lots of noisy bands at night, sometimes with three all competing with each other. The only sir conditioned restaurant is often off limits because it is being used by a group."

While returning to hotels, our son was feeling unwell. While arriving on the lobby, guest service employees thereat us unfairly with other guests. We were asking for buggy service several times and they gave us bad feedback. We need to ask to reception for the third times then they gave us a ride to our rooms. Hopefully guest services in the lobby can give better experiences for their guest in the future."

"469.","Natalie Wong","2","2024-12-30","1","We had a bad experience at this 5 stars hotel. It’s not valued for money at all, the room with the pool view doesn’t really have privacy as people swim around they can easily look at you through the transparent glass, dirty towels and horrible sink( basically stuffed with other things) the bathtub is not clean enough. After the technician came to fix it( he wore shoes to get inside and used the pump without sanitized the sink after)"
"470.","Alex Ignatenko","103","2022-12-30","4","Great beautiful area, awesome pools for chilling. Friendly staff. Quality of food is quite unstable and depends from day to day. WiFi is really good and working in all area. We think that they have a lot of trainee staff. That is the reason of non stable service. Big minus that on our check out staff is missed our time and we should take away our luggage ourself. That was pretty hard on very warm weather conditions. So place is very good but there's a lot of work need to improve."
"471.","Benoit Denicourt","11","2022-12-30","1","5 Stars, great rating… But this is not what we had. Arrival went smooth, location and hotel look great. Lobby is massive and very nice, hotel has lots of great outdoor space and a nice view over the pools and the beach. Staff was friendly. We stayed 3 nights, first night was good, room is a bit outdated for a 5 stars hotel, but overall, it was a good start. Then, we tried the breakfast, not worth it, large selection, but very average. It is when we learned that the hotel was hosting an international gaming competition….they starting building a stage and different tents all over the hotel…bye the beach view, hello view on tons of ongoing constructions. We were no more on a 5 stars hotel but in a expo hall…all you can see is constructions everywhere, from the pool, from the beach, that’s all you can see. Extremely disappointed, we were not in our own little paradise but in a gaming event…. Other than that, only 1 shower gel provided per room, no bubble bath, which is too bad with such a great bathtub. That’s not enough, you expect more from a 5 stars hotel. Restaurant, very average and overprice. Room comfortable but a bit outdated, does not give the feeling of a 5 stars. Contestants arriving by bus at the hotel, very crowded lobby, doesn’t make you feel like you are in a 5 stars hotel. Undertrained staff, friendly, but not the most efficient. Very big disappointment, I paid for a peaceful long weekend, with view on the beach…that’s not what I had at all."
"472.","Rachel Howman","16","2022-12-30","2","Our stay was for a week in a private villa with a pool. Whilst the pool was great, the room and bathroom were quite outdated and lacking in electrical sockets to charge phones etc, so we had to unplug the lamps and electrical mosquito repellents. The bathroom is outside which meant mosquitoes were constantly in the bedroom and you ended up being bitten whenever you ventured to the toilet in the night. On the plus side there are plenty of restaurants to choose from, direct access to the beach and staff are wonderful."
"473.","Zahraa Aljanabi","1","2020-12-30","5","Amazing first time experience here in Bali. Amazing and caring staff and cleaners, which made the experience one hundred times better. Recommend booking the hotel rooms with private pool if you are travelling as a family as many couples tend to go out during the night time to swim and have dinner. And wouldn't want to be disturbed by kids. Many activities were offered and made accessible for everyone staying at the hotel. Completely private not having other people outside the hotel swimming in the pools and beach. Very clean environment with multiple restaurants and water activities. Highly recommend getting the breakfast buffet as part of the hotel package. Variety of foods were offered with kid friendly meals also offered. Highly recommend booking at Inaya Putri hotel in Bali."

Terlihat dari awal saya menyerahkan kunci mobil untuk vallet, saya harus menyerahkan sendiri kunci tersebut di meja concierge di dalam. Petugas di depan lobby hanya menginstruksi saja tidak melayani. Ketika mobil mau saya pakai pun, tim vallet saling melempar tugas (saya tau karna saya mendengarkan mereka berbicara di HT) 2. Dinding kamar lembab, banyak cat mengelupas di kamar saya 1107 3. Kami memesan kamar dengan layanan private pool access, tapi kolam renang tsb airnya kotor, lantai dasar kolam renang pun kotor. Tidak ada filter menyala, otomatis air pun pasti tidak terfilter sama sekali, 2 malam saya menginap, kolam renang sama sekali tidak di maintenance. 4. Malam terakhir sebelum kami check out, saya pergi keluar ber2 dengan istri, anak kami bersama dgn susternya dikamar, kami pesankan makanan lewat gra*, makanannya sampai di hotel, oleh suster kami lobby hotel di telp, jawabannya nanti dikabarin apakah makanannya sudah datang apa belum (sedangkan dari aplikasi kami, makanan tsb sudah sampai diterima oleh lobby), tapi 30 menit tak kunjung di telp ulang oleh lobby, ketika di telp ulang, jawabannya masih sama, di cek dikabarin.

Pertama-tama, staf pada saat kedatangan saya sangat tidak ramah dan tidak kooperatif. Saya merasa mereka bahkan tidak berusaha membantu ketika saya meminta kamar yang bersih. Ketika akhirnya saya mendapat kamar, sangat berisik dan saya bisa mendengar suara dari tamu lain dan musik mereka. Saya pikir mungkin itu hanya sementara, tetapi itu berlanjut sepanjang malam dan saya tidak bisa tidur. Saya meminta staf beberapa kali untuk melakukan sesuatu untuk mengurangi kebisingan, tetapi mereka tampaknya tidak mampu menyelesaikan masalah. Seolah itu belum cukup, kamar saya juga cukup kotor dan ada jamur di dinding. Kamar mandi juga memiliki masalah dengan saluran pembuangan dan selalu ada air di lantai. Secara keseluruhan, pengalaman saya di Hotel Merusaka tidak menyenangkan dan saya tidak akan merekomendasikannya. Stafnya tidak mampu menenangkan tamu atau menyelesaikan masalah.

Pada tanggal 18 feb 2023 pagi ketika kita kami sekeluarga hendak keluar lobi dengan membawa payung yang disediakan dalam kamar (pagi itu sedang hujan dari dini hari), ketika menuju mobil jemputan (kita ber 6 dewasa, 1 anak-anak dan bayi tanpa bule) dihentikan dan dihadang oleh petugas lobi (berseragam hijau pupus, tidak memperhatikan tag namanya) agar tidak membawa payung keluar. Kemudian saya bertanya mengapa tidak boleh? lagian kan sedang hujan? lalu dijawab dengan ketus jika penggunaan payung hanya boleh di area hotel dan jumlahnya terbatas. Sungguh terkejut dengan jawaban itu, karena setahu saya payung boleh dibawa kemanapun dan juga tidak ada tanda larangan membawanya keluar area hotel di tempat meletakan payung yang tersedia banyak dibeberapa titik area hotel. Pada saat check in pun tidak ada info peringatan itu. Sedangkan hari-hari sebelumnya, ketika kita berpergian dengan bule dan membawa payung keluar juga tidak ada masalah. Sangat disayangkan dan tidak masuk diakal jika hotel bintang 5 yang berada di lingkungan elit punya masalah keterbatasan jumlah payung. Sedangkan banyak bule terlihat membawa payung dari merusaka sampai ke area bali collection, juga tidak ada larangan. Giliran kita yang tamu lokal, petugas lobi beraninya langsung ngegas. Sama-sama tahu tapi beraninya cuma sama tamu lokal. Service merusaka memang sudah terkenal manis sama bule saja. Ini photo-photo tempat payung, tolong di tunjukan Plakat atau papan info larangan bawa payung tidak boleh dibawah ke luar area hotel!!! 🤬 🤬 🤬 🤬 Gak bakalan nginep lagi disini lagi!!!!"

Katanya bagian front office akan segera dikabarkan apabila kamar sudah ready. Kebetulan kamar saya connecting room Jadinya saya menunggu di kamar sodara saya. Saya lihat kamar saya udh ready Namun, kenyataannya saya tidak dihubungi sama skali sampaimengambil kunci kamar saya sendiri. Bener2 kecewa banget. Kedua, koper saya tidak dikirim, padahal luggage tag sudah saya berikan ke Concierge. Entah concierge menghilangkannya atau gimana. Saya memberikan 3 luggage tag secara bersamaan tapi yang dikirim cuma 2 dan malah bilang bahwa saya cuma ksih 2 luggage tag. Dan saya disuruh ke concierge untuk mencari koper saya ( sangat ga profesional sih ini) Saya membawa bayi disini, dan kamar belum ready itu benar2 membuat saya jadi capek. Padahal waktu check in hotel itu 15.00 dan sya sudah request early check in pukul 13.00 tapi malah di kasih check in jam 18.00 dengan koper yang belum ready! Kecewa banget dengan service disini."

Padahal cuaca lagi panas2nya dan anak saya merengek kehausan karena lama nunggu saya check in. Cm masalah sepele, tapi utk saya sangat berarti, yg awalnya mau extend jadi batal. Petugas yang melayani breakfast di resto juga kurang ramah, minta diambilkan minum kesannya ogah2an, lihat piring kotor di meja cuma melengos, tolong di perbaiki standar pelayanannya dan keramahannya terutama petugas2 yg berhub langsung dgn tamu."

HALOOOO, berarti sebelumnya hanya alasan saja ya? yang saya rasakan lagi, sangat membedakan service antara turis lokal dan turis asing.. saya malam2 gendong bayi karena ketiduran, tidak ada 1 pun staff yang menawarkan buggy service untuk ke area kamar.. SANGAT KECEWA MEREKOMENDASIKAN HOTEL INI KE KELUARGA, DAN TIDAK AKAN KEMBALI LAGI KESINI.. PADAHAL SAAT STAY PERTAMA KALI KAMI SANGAT PUAS DAN HAPPY STAY DISINI..

"551.","Stephen","21","2025-11-14","1","Terlalu Mahal, Ketinggalan Zaman, dan Sangat Mengecewakan: Peringatan bagi Para Pencari Kemewahan ​Sejak kami tiba, resor ini langsung menunjukkan diri sebagai tempat yang ketinggalan zaman dan sangat membutuhkan perhatian. Apa yang disajikan sebagai tempat pelarian romantis yang eksklusif terasa langsung dikorbankan. Proses check-in di ruang terbuka menjadi pertanda kekecewaan layanan dan fasilitas yang menyusul. ​Meskipun memesan salah satu vila premium properti ini (dengan harga lebih dari $8,8 juta IDR per malam), perlakuan yang kami terima tidak berbeda dengan kamar standar. Kami tiba hanya satu jam sebelum waktu check-in resmi dan ditolak mentah-mentah untuk mendapatkan manfaat all-inclusive kami. Hal ini membingungkan dan tidak dapat diterima, terutama mengingat tarifnya dan fakta bahwa kami berangkat lebih awal (berangkat pukul 8 pagi) dan memiliki akses untuk check-out terlambat pukul 3 sore. Kurangnya itikad baik untuk tamu yang membayar mahal menciptakan preseden buruk. Vila: Mungil, Lelah, dan Benar-benar Disalahartikan Vila mewah itu sendiri sangat mengecewakan. Vila itu tampak lesu, dan jelas membutuhkan renovasi. Untuk sebuah resor dengan harga semahal ini, ketiadaan area duduk dalam ruangan ber-AC sungguh sebuah kegagalan. Kamar mandi yang hanya bernuansa terbuka merupakan tanda lain dari usia dan buruknya perawatan kamar. Fasilitasnya pun sama mengecewakannya: kulkasnya panas, dan janji all-inclusive hanya mencakup empat minuman per hari di kamar tanpa layanan kamar sama sekali. Penipuan All-Inclusive Namun, pelanggaran paling serius terletak pada paket all-inclusive. Kami biasanya menginap di Melia—yang, dengan harga yang sama, berada di dunia kemewahan yang berbeda—dan resor ini bahkan tidak sebanding. Setibanya di sana, kami diberitahu oleh resepsionis bahwa paket all-inclusive hanya mencakup minuman beralkohol dan minuman lokal. Kami segera menyadari bahwa paket ini bahkan tidak termasuk Bintang, bir lokal pilihan kami, yang merupakan biaya tambahan. Bayangkan betapa tidak percayanya berada di Bali, dengan paket lengkap, dan harus membayar ekstra untuk Bintang! ​Bagi siapa pun yang mencari liburan mewah yang benar-benar romantis di Bali, saya sampaikan saran yang tulus: hindari resor ini. Resor ini benar-benar terlalu digemari, sangat mengecewakan, dan merupakan pemborosan uang di lokasi yang begitu menakjubkan."
"552.","Артур Сиразов","5","2025-11-14","1","Saat ini kami menginap di hotel ini. Hotelnya sangat tua, dan kamarnya buruk sekali – pancurannya tidak berfungsi, seprai bernoda, gordennya juga bernoda, dan peredam suaranya buruk sekali, seolah-olah ada yang melakukan sesuatu di kamar kami. Kamar mandinya dalam kondisi buruk, berjamur di sekelilingnya. Ada stopkontak di satu sisi tempat tidur, tetapi tidak di sisi lainnya. Hal-hal yang tampaknya sederhana ini memang praktis, tetapi tidak dipikirkan atau diperbaiki dengan matang. Kami datang untuk sarapan; ada banyak pilihan, tetapi semuanya sangat kotor sehingga merusak selera makan. Di tempat sushi gulung, ada kecap asin, tetapi saya tidak menemukan piring untuk menuangkannya. Saya rasa Anda harus menuangkannya langsung ke sushi gulung... Di tempat Anda mengambil air dan jus, ada gelas di bawahnya, tetapi semuanya kotor. Rasanya seperti kain lap yang digunakan untuk mengelap piring tidak diganti. Gelas-gelasnya tertutup serat dan semacam noda, dan piring-piringnya juga kurang memuaskan. Lalu seorang gadis menghampiri kami dan memperingatkan bahwa sarapan akan selesai dalam 20 menit dan mungkin kami ingin memesan minuman. Kami memesan jus segar, menunggu 20 menit, dan minuman itu masih belum datang. Dan ini baru hari pertama kami di sini; saya yakin akan ada lebih banyak keluhan. Ketidakpedulian pemilik dan staf hotel telah menyebabkan keadaan ini. Saya terkejut dengan ulasan positif untuk hotel ini, padahal banyak sekali kekurangannya."

Pengalaman kami dirusak oleh kotoran, dan meninggalkan kenangan yang sangat buruk. Sangat penting untuk meningkatkan kebersihan demi menciptakan suasana yang menyenangkan dan menghargai pelanggan serta lingkungan."
"554.","jemma carney","11","2025-08-14","1","Meskipun merupakan hotel termahal dari tiga hotel yang kami tempati selama perjalanan kami ke Bali, resor besar ini adalah yang paling tidak kami sukai. Perjuangan sehari-hari untuk mendapatkan kursi santai di tepi kolam renang sangat menjengkelkan, karena para tamu akan memesannya dengan handuk sejak pagi hari, dan masalah ini tidak ditangani oleh staf. Masalah ini terus berlanjut sepanjang hari. Meskipun pantai tampak menarik pada pandangan pertama, laut dipenuhi dengan sampah. Pada hari pertama kami, putri teman kami sayangnya menginjak kondom saat berjalan di pasir. Kejadian ini membuat kami enggan mengunjungi pantai selama sisa masa tinggal kami. Selain itu, kami merasa bahwa jumlah staf tidak mencukupi untuk melayani para tamu dengan baik. Piring makan siang dan gelas minuman tidak dikumpulkan secara teratur, dan handuk kolam renang habis pada dua dari lima hari kami berada di sana sebelum diisi ulang. Resor ini memiliki empat restoran, tetapi pilihan menunya rata-rata dan cukup mirip. Meskipun menggunakan paket all-inclusive, beberapa hidangan dikenakan biaya tambahan. Mengingat lokasi hotel, kami mengharapkan lebih banyak pilihan hiburan untuk para tamu selain beberapa penyanyi yang tampil saat makan malam. Setelah lima malam, kami tidak hanya bosan tetapi juga jenuh dengan makanannya. Pada malam terakhir kami, tiga hidangan penutup di menu restoran di bawah lobi utama tidak tersedia. Kamar kami menyenangkan, tetapi hanya memiliki satu gantungan handuk, dan pilihan di minibar yang termasuk dalam paket cukup biasa. Tidak ada juga laci di kamar, yang menurut kami merupakan kekurangan desain. Sofa juga tidak nyaman. Kami membayar ekstra untuk kamar dengan akses langsung ke kolam renang, tetapi kami hanya menggunakannya sekali dan merasa itu tidak sepadan dengan biaya tambahannya. Di sisi positifnya, stafnya ramah."

Kemudian saya menghubungi lobi menggunakan nomor telepon di Google, namun tetap tidak ada yang datang, saya menelepon lagi, tetap tidak ada yang datang. Saya sedang berjalan ke lobi ketika seorang staf hotel dengan buggy mengatakan dia datang untuk menjemput saya, ketika saya sampai di lobi, istri saya menelepon saya untuk mengatakan bahwa seseorang datang untuk membukakan pintu, begitu banyak kebingungan untuk hal yang sepele.

Saya yakin sekali bagaimana saya meninggalkannya. Pengalaman ini membuat saya mempertanyakan seberapa baik staf dilatih dalam menangani barang-barang milik tamu.

Kami membawanya keluar dan setelah mandi, kami melihat wajah anak laki-laki saya memerah, ruam gatal di pipinya di bawah dan atas matanya juga. . Dia menangis dan sangat tidak nyaman, dan sebagai orang tua, sungguh memilukan melihat anak Anda kesakitan karena sesuatu yang seharusnya aman. Ketika saya mengeluh, mereka mengatakan kepada saya itu tidak pernah terjadi sebelumnya tetapi cukup yakin itu mungkin diencerkan secara salah.

Sentuhan pribadi dan tulus mereka sungguh tak terlupakan. Lokasi tepi pantainya sungguh menakjubkan, hanya beberapa langkah dari pantai, terasa seperti surga. Kamar-kamarnya luas dan dirancang dengan elegan. Bersantap di sini adalah pengalaman yang sesungguhnya. Makanannya disiapkan dengan cermat, memadukan cita rasa lokal dan hidangan Indonesia. Resor ini bukan sekadar tempat menginap—melainkan pelarian ke dunia ketenangan dan kenyamanan yang menjadikannya destinasi tak terlupakan. Saya pulang dengan perasaan segar dan terinspirasi."
"564.","Sarah Ayati","5","2025-04-14","1","Sayangnya, pengalaman menginap kami di Merusaka Nusa Dua sangat mengecewakan.

Suasananya sama sekali tidak menenangkan – banyak tamu yang berisik, tidak sopan, dan beberapa mabuk. Setelah mengeluh, kami hanya ditawari upgrade kamar, yang tidak menyelesaikan masalah sebenarnya. Kami ingin meninggalkan hotel lebih awal, tetapi malah dirujuk ke Booking.com. Kami tidak merekomendasikannya – sayangnya harga dan kenyataan di sini sangat tidak sesuai. Pantainya kotor; tidak ada hubungannya dengan Bali. Kami akan tetap check out…sangat tidak memuaskan."

Saat sarapan, hanya ada Aalu Baji dan Pakoda untuk vegetarian di restoran Asia ini. Semua menu lainnya mengandung telur atau bukan vegetarian. Atas permintaan, mereka membuat Aalu Paratha yang hambar dan benar-benar mentah. Sama sekali tidak direkomendasikan untuk vegetarian. Sangat tidak disarankan untuk orang India jika Anda lebih menyukai makanan vegetarian murni."

Yang ingin saya sampaikan di sini adalah keterlambatan pengembalian deposit yang mereka minta. Ya, mereka meminta deposit sebesar 2.000.000 rupiah, yang setara dengan sekitar 115 euro, dan yah... saya tidak tahu kapan uang saya akan kembali. Saya sudah mengirim pesan ke layanan tamu mereka dan memang dibalas dengan cepat, katanya bank mereka lama sekali membalas. Mereka sudah mengirim email ke bank, tapi siapa tahu? Saya bukan orang pertama yang membayar deposit ini dengan kartu kredit, jadi apa masalahnya? Sudah 10 hari kerja berlalu dan belum ada pengembalian uang. Mungkin saya akan kembali beberapa hari lagi untuk mengatakan bahwa uang saya dicuri."

Kami tidak menemukan air panas di kamar mandi, memberi tahu manajer jaga secara langsung, dia baru mengirim dua teknisi setelah 30 menit, dan mengatakan kepada saya bahwa itu adalah alam karena konsumsi airnya tinggi… Saya terkejut mereka memberi saya alasan ini. Saya mencoba menelepon manajer jaga dua kali setelahnya tetapi dia tidak pernah mengangkat telepon. Sekarang sudah pukul 22.00 siang dan saya dan istri masih menunggu air panas"
"568.","Ivascu Vesna","5","2025-01-14","1","Saya memesan kamar melalui agen perjalanan di Bali, dan karena saya tidak melakukan reservasi langsung di Booking.com, saya meninggalkan ulasan saya di sini untuk membantu wisatawan lain dalam membuat keputusan yang tepat. Pertama dan terpenting, saya ingin memastikan calon tamu tidak tertipu oleh agen perjalanan di Bali atau Rumania untuk memilih hotel ini, karena hal itu dapat merusak pengalaman liburan mereka. Harganya sangat tinggi; sepertinya agen perjalanan mengamankan reservasi dengan harga yang sangat rendah lalu membebankan biaya tersebut kepada wisatawan. Selain itu, saya tidak habis pikir mengapa mereka merekomendasikan tempat yang mengenakan tarif yang sama dengan hotel-hotel internasional ternama di mana Anda benar-benar dapat menemukan layanan bintang lima. Hotel ini bahkan hampir tidak memenuhi syarat sebagai hotel bintang tiga. Saya memesan empat malam termasuk sarapan, tetapi saya tidak bisa tidur semalam pun. Ketika saya meminta pengembalian dana, manajer hotel dengan tegas menolak untuk mengembalikan uang saya. Kamar-kamarnya dalam kondisi yang sangat buruk—perabotannya tua, kasurnya usang, dan seprai bernoda seperti ada kutu busuk. Pendingin ruangannya berisik dan tidak memadai untuk standar hotel bintang lima, padahal sistem ventilasi internal yang tenang seharusnya memungkinkan tidur malam yang nyenyak. Stafnya tampak kurang terawat, dengan seragam yang kotor. Area kolam renang tidak terawat, dan terdapat sampah di jalan setapak dan pantai. Kondisi perawatan secara keseluruhan terlihat jelas dari lobi hotel, di mana jok kursi yang compang-camping dan kotoran di lantai langsung menarik perhatian. Saya perhatikan hotel ini memiliki peringkat tinggi di Booking.com; namun, saya menduga ulasan yang kurang baik mungkin telah dihapus. Bagi Anda yang berasal dari Rumania dan membaca ini, saya harus mengatakan bahwa menginap di sini terasa seperti menginap di Eforie. Saya harap pengalaman saya dapat menyelamatkan orang lain dari pengalaman menginap yang mengecewakan."
"569.","Danielius Radvilavičius","41","2025-04-14","1","Pengalaman terburuk di Bali dari 2 kali saya menginap di sini. Saya meminta kamar dengan tempat tidur king sebanyak 4 kali, dan 4 kali lagi dijamin semuanya akan dilakukan agar saya bisa mendapatkannya. Saat check-in, mereka dengan menyesal memberi tahu saya bahwa kamar dengan pemandangan taman tidak tersedia dengan tempat tidur king, dan kami mendapatkan kamar dengan dua tempat tidur - sofanya bernoda, tidak ada tempat pengisian daya ponsel, kekurangan perlengkapan dasar lainnya, dan hanya berkarat dan kuno. Setelah mengeluh, dalam 1 jam, secara ajaib kamar dengan tempat tidur king muncul dan kami ditawari untuk pindah ke sana. Sistem ventilasinya sangat berisik bahkan dengan pengaturan rendah, sehingga mustahil untuk tidur. Harga tempat ini terlalu mahal untuk apa yang ditawarkannya."
"570.","Sunshine K","12","2025-05-14","1","Ini hotel yang sangat besar. Sangat perlu direnovasi dan perlu banyak peningkatan. Semuanya kurang memuaskan. Ini jelas bukan resor bintang 5.

"571.","Simit Mapara","3","2025-04-14","1","Pelayanan terburuk yang bisa diharapkan dari resor bintang 5. Stafnya sangat kasar dan bahkan tidak mau mendengarkan. Kami memesan tempat tidur king size, tetapi mereka malah memberi kami tempat tidur twin. Ketiga keluarga tersebut membawa anak-anak, tetapi mereka mengharapkan kami menginap di tempat tidur twin. HIG, sebagai merek perhotelan, memiliki staf yang paling tidak ramah, sama sekali tidak sopan. Saya tidak akan merekomendasikan tempat ini kepada siapa pun di masa mendatang."
"572.","Tejash Shah","4","2025-04-14","1","Proses pemesanannya sungguh mimpi buruk, dengan banyak kesalahan reservasi yang tak seorang pun repot-repot memperbaikinya. Layanan penyambutan tamu tidak ada, dan saya dibiarkan berdiri di resepsionis terlalu lama sebelum akhirnya diizinkan check-in. Lebih parah lagi, tidak ada kipas angin atau AC di resepsionis, membuat saya harus menunggu lama sekali. Jelas bukan seperti yang Anda harapkan dari hotel bintang 5. Saya tidak akan merekomendasikan hotel bintang 5 ini. Hotel bintang 5 ini lebih buruk daripada hotel non-bintang."
"573.","Wei Long Tan","36","2025-01-14","1","Hotel ini benar-benar mengecewakan. Kamarnya sangat ketinggalan zaman, dan unit AC-nya sama sekali tidak memadai. Tidak hanya tidak memberikan pendinginan yang memadai, tetapi juga mengalami kebocoran selama saya menginap. Lebih parah lagi, istri saya diserang kutu busuk dengan ganas, meninggalkan noda darah di seluruh seprai. Tanggapan hotel sama sekali tidak memadai. Mereka hanya menawarkan untuk mengganti seprai, menunjukkan ketidakpedulian terhadap situasi yang ada. Baru setelah tekanan yang signifikan, mereka setuju untuk memindahkan kami ke kamar lain. Tidak ada kompensasi lain yang ditawarkan, dan sikap manajer jaga Gusti sangat buruk, bersikeras bahwa ini hanyalah serangga/nyamuk Bali biasa, sebuah klaim yang menghina dan tidak akurat, terutama mengingat bukti foto. Pengalaman sarapannya sama buruknya. Antrean panjang untuk mendapatkan tempat duduk setiap pagi dan para tamu terpaksa berada di bawah terik matahari atau hujan, karena staf dengan tidak berperasaan menolak untuk membiarkan mereka menunggu di tempat teduh. Sangat buruk sehingga saya harus check out satu malam lebih awal (dan mereka menolak untuk mengembalikan uang), dan saya sungguh-sungguh menyarankan semua calon wisatawan untuk menjauhi tempat yang tidak berstandar ini."
"574.","erita peng","12","2025-04-14","1","Saya baru menyadarinya setelah check-in. Setelah check-in dan hendak mandi, saya sangat terkejut ketika shower yang sudah saya siapkan diganti. Untuk sesaat, saya tidak percaya. Filter putihnya berubah dalam 5 detik menjadi sesuatu yang tampak seperti belum diganti selama setahun. Saya terkejut lagi sebelum tidur... Saya bisa mengerti serangga lain, karena mereka tropis. Tapi saya ragu kecoak. Sarapan...jujur ​​saja, tidak ada yang bisa dimakan. Benar-benar tidak ada. (Ini mengingatkan saya pada hotel bintang 4 di Taiwan.) Singkatnya, ini hanyalah hotel dengan harga terjangkau di Bali."
"575.","Nidya Yu","136","2025-02-14","1","Pelayanannya buruk. Ada banyak kamar dan fasilitas, dan areanya sangat luas, tetapi jelas tidak ada cukup staf. Saat check-in, mereka sama sekali tidak memperkenalkan fasilitas, aktivitas, lokasi sarapan, atau waktu sarapan; mereka hanya memindai paspor kami dan memanggil orang berikutnya. Sarapannya sangat lama, setiap kelompok harus menunggu sepuluh menit hingga nomor mereka dipanggil. Meja-meja tidak dibersihkan tepat waktu, dan kami dipaksa makan di bawah terik matahari, hampir kena sengatan panas. Ada juga banyak lalat. Fasilitas kamar sudah tua, AC-nya bocor, hanya tempat tidurnya yang lumayan, dan kedap suaranya buruk. Secara keseluruhan, pengalaman yang sangat buruk."
"576.","Neil O'Shaughnessy","4","2025-01-14","1","Hotel terburuk yang pernah saya kunjungi di Bali. Pelayanannya sangat buruk. Petugas yang menjaga handuk kolam renang yang sudah tua, bernoda, dan robek memberi tahu kami bahwa kolam renang tutup pukul 19.00 karena jelas-jelas dia tidak ingin melakukan pekerjaan lagi. Staf kolam renang harus mengambilkan handuk untuk kami karena kolam renang buka hingga larut malam. Staf kolam renang hanya berdiri berkelompok. Botol, gelas, dan piring makanan kami menumpuk berjam-jam di meja, membuat lalat beterbangan di area tersebut. Kamar mandi di kamar tidak bersih dan ada pasir di sana pada hari pertama. Fasilitasnya kuno dan usang, bantal kursi santai pantai robek. Paket lengkapnya tidak sepadan. Pizza terburuk yang pernah saya makan. Restoran Indonesia memang menyajikan makanan yang enak. Memiliki 4 pijat termasuk, tetapi tempat itu sudah dipesan untuk perjalanan kami. Meskipun saya sudah mengirim pesan sebelumnya dan bertanya apakah saya perlu memesan restoran/spa terlebih dahulu, mereka bilang tidak. Buang-buang uang, tidak menikmatinya! Tidak menenangkan."

Musik yang berbeda-beda terdengar dari dua sisi. Musiknya bermasalah dan berhenti setiap beberapa menit, menimbulkan suara-suara aneh yang keras. Stafnya tidak ramah. Pantainya penuh tanah. Sulit menemukan kursi berjemur kosong yang tidak terkena sinar matahari sepenuhnya. Seluruh tempat terlihat kumuh dan sangat membutuhkan renovasi."
"578.","Alok Sharma","10","2025-07-14","1","Hotelnya bagus, tetapi tidak cocok untuk orang India karena tidak ada makanan vegetarian yang tersedia di sini. Selain itu, permintaan saya tidak dipenuhi, padahal rata-rata 10% tamu adalah orang India. Untuk makanan non-vegetarian, Anda tidak akan merasakan apa pun seperti makanan India. Jika Anda memilih makanan India, mohon periksa terlebih dahulu sebelum datang. Saya di sini hari ini dan saya kecewa."
"579.","Jon Tarifa","7","2025-01-14","1","Kami sangat kecewa dengan pengalaman kami di resor ini. Kami sengaja memilih destinasi ini untuk melarikan diri dari hiruk pikuk Canggu, tetapi malah mendapati diri kami berada di lingkungan yang lebih bising. Selama menginap, ada pesta pernikahan yang sangat berisik, benar-benar menghancurkan kesempatan untuk bersantai. Sebagai keluarga beranggotakan empat orang, mustahil bagi kami untuk menikmati waktu kami—anak-anak kami gelisah dan tidak nyaman karena kebisingan yang terus-menerus dan memekakkan telinga di seluruh tempat. Lebih parah lagi, kami bahkan tidak bisa menikmati jalan-jalan santai di pantai tanpa merasa seperti mengganggu pesta pernikahan. Ketika kami menyampaikan kekhawatiran kami di kasir, baik resepsionis maupun manajer yang bertugas sama sekali tidak menunjukkan empati. Tidak ada permintaan maaf—hanya tanggapan acuh tak acuh bahwa gangguan semacam ini normal dan sesuatu yang harus kami terima. Terus terang, sikap seperti itu sangat menyebalkan. Di atas semua ini, staf restoran bahkan tidak bisa menyiapkan pesanan kami dengan benar, membuat kesalahan beberapa kali selama kunjungan singkat kami yang hanya dua malam. Ini jauh dari liburan santai yang kami harapkan, dan kami tidak akan kembali."

Karyawannya sangat tidak profesional, saya sulit percaya mereka bekerja di bidang perhotelan: 1. Tidak dapat memenuhi jadwal check-in. Mereka hanya menyuruh saya duduk dan menunggu sampai dihubungi melalui WhatsApp. Tapi setelah 1 setengah jam, yang saya yakini cukup waktu untuk menyiapkan kamar, masih belum ada apa-apa. Waktu check-in sudah lewat setengah jam yang lalu, tapi satu-satunya jawaban yang saya dapatkan ketika saya bertanya adalah menunggu?!! Bukan begini seharusnya hotel bintang 5 memperlakukan pelanggan. SAYA TIDAK MENERIMA PERMINTAAN MAAF ATAU PENJELASAN apa pun untuk ini!!! 2. Ketika saya bertanya cara untuk bepergian ke luar (karena ini hotel besar dan mungkin lebih dari 1 km dari tempat menginap kami), resepsionis hanya memelototi saya dan berkata Anda bisa memesan taksi?! Seperti apakah itu diperbolehkan? Apakah begitu cara Anda memperlakukan pelanggan? Saya bertanya hanya karena melihat mobil listriknya, berharap mereka akan memberi saya penjelasan tentang cara menggunakan atau memesannya!! 3. Setelah saya mengkonfrontasi mereka tentang masa inap saya, mereka memberi saya kunci kamar dan menyuruh saya menunggu seseorang mengantar saya ke kamar dan yah, sudah 15 menit berlalu, siapa sangka, kan? 4. Dan alasan saya mengungkapkan semua ini di ulasan ini adalah karena kami bukan satu-satunya, ada orang lain yang harus menunggu di lobi seperti kami juga setelah SATU JAM melewati waktu check-in! Saya sangat berharap tidak akan pernah menemukan hotel seperti ini lagi, tidak hanya membuat saya kesal, tetapi juga membuat saya merasa seperti membuang-buang uang untuk layanan bintang 5."

Hari ke 1 Suami sakit keracunan makanan, hari kedua saya sakit keracunan makanan. Ini membuat kami pingsan selama 3 malam kami menginap dan kami hampir tidak meninggalkan kamar. Harus memanggil dokter dua kali karena betapa sakitnya kami. Karena itu, 3 hari terakhir liburan kami dihabiskan di tempat tidur atau di toilet. Tambahkan ke Respons Hotel - sayang sekali Anda tidak bertanggung jawab dalam balasan Anda. Itu pasti makanan yang kami makan di hotel karena kami hanya makan dan minum dari hotel Anda. Ya, gejalanya bisa memakan waktu hingga 8 jam, tapi bisa juga muncul dalam beberapa jam. Meski sudah jam 8 masih makan di hotel. Dr cukup yakin itu juga dari makanan yang kami makan di sini."

Kami juga tahu tentang fasilitas, dan kami tinggal di Alto Adige, Italia, di mana hotel-hotelnya berkelas tinggi. Kursi pantai selalu kotor. Sarapannya kurang berkualitas (padahal kami berada di hotel bintang 5). Tidak perlu komentar. Harganya seperti di Eropa, tetapi dengan kuantitas yang bahkan tidak sampai setengahnya."
"589.","Ana Carolina Moreira","42","2025-01-14","1","Sayangnya, pengalaman yang mengerikan. Saya tidak merekomendasikannya. Sama sekali tidak. Pelayanannya sangat tidak terorganisir. Hotel ini mungkin memiliki terlalu sedikit karyawan untuk jumlah tamu yang sangat banyak. Rasanya seperti berada di tempat yang berantakan. Ada keterlambatan pelayanan di restoran. Ada ketidakteraturan dalam alokasi kamar. Kami datang sebagai rombongan dan mereka tidak menempatkan kami di kamar yang benar. Salah satu pasangan, setelah berada di kamar, diminta untuk pergi dan pindah ke kamar lain. Saya datang dengan tunangan saya dan mereka menempatkan kami di kamar dengan dua tempat tidur single yang digabungkan. Mengerikan. Meskipun berada tepat di depan pantai, pantai ini sangat kotor dan ombaknya besar. Sungguh memalukan."
"590.","Nikola Lefterov","13","2025-01-14","1","Pantainya sangat kotor sehingga tidak cocok untuk aktivitas air apa pun. Kolam renangnya sangat panas dan tidak nyaman untuk ditinggali. Restoran: Meskipun kami memesan paket all-inclusive, ada banyak hal yang dikenakan biaya tambahan. Biaya tambahannya sekitar 5 hingga 10 euro, yang tidak masalah, tetapi kualitas makanannya sangat buruk dan kami mengalami banyak masalah perut. Tidak ada aktivitas malam hari jika Anda masih muda. Anda tidak bisa melakukan apa pun di sana setelah pukul 23:00. Semuanya tutup dan Anda bahkan tidak bisa minum. Secara umum, kebersihannya buruk, makanannya buruk, dan benar-benar membosankan. Ini adalah liburan terburuk saya sejauh ini. Saya bahkan mengakhirinya sebelum waktu yang direncanakan."

"592.","Anna V","31","2025-01-14","1","Karena ini adalah hotel milik pemerintah, stafnya sama sekali tidak repot-repot membuat wisatawan nyaman. Kamar-kamarnya tua dan kotor. Mereka hanya membersihkan kamar jika Anda menelepon setidaknya dua kali dan bertanya. Tidak ada rasa bersih sama sekali di kamar. Karena hotel ini milik pemerintah, manajemen mengadakan acara dengan musik keras untuk beberapa delegasi hingga pukul 2 pagi. Ketika saya bertanya mengapa saya tidak bisa tidur nyenyak di kamar saya pada pukul 11 ​​malam di hari Jumat, manajer menjelaskan bahwa itu baru hari ini dan semuanya akan baik-baik saja besok... tetapi mereka ada acara hari ini dan mereka tidak akan melakukan apa pun untuk itu. Saya sangat tidak puas dengan layanan di hotel ini. Saya harus menginap selama dua hari karena kurangnya kamar yang tersedia di hotel tetangga. Semuanya sangat buruk. Saya tidak merekomendasikannya jika Anda mengharapkan masa inap yang tenang dan nyaman yang setara dengan hotel bintang 5. Saat ini, nilainya 3+ paling banyak, dan itu mengingat lokasinya yang strategis dan pantainya yang indah. Kamar-kamarnya sangat tua sehingga AC-nya bocor, dan kami harus menunggu beberapa jam hingga teknisi datang dan memperbaikinya. Lantai kamar kami tergenang air; ketika mereka datang untuk memperbaikinya, mereka membuka penutup AC dan air terjun menyembur keluar. Sayangnya, semua yang ada di hotel ini benar-benar suram. Tidak ada yang menawarkan untuk memindahkan saya ke kamar lain. Dan tidak ada permintaan maaf yang diberikan. Kedap suara di kamar sangat buruk. Pukul 7.30 pagi, orang-orang mulai berjalan di lorong, dan kebisingannya membangunkan saya. Entah kenapa, petugas kebersihan mulai mengetuk pintu kami saat itu, menawarkan untuk membersihkan kamar kami. Wajar saja, pukul 7.30 pagi terlalu awal untuk membersihkan, untuk sedikitnya. Tapi kemudian, untuk membersihkan ini, saya menelepon resepsionis dua atau tiga kali sepanjang hari, dan ketika nada bicara saya mulai menuntut, seseorang dari staf akhirnya datang dan membersihkan. Minibar tidak diisi. Singkatnya, hotel yang dikelola pemerintah dengan staf yang buruk..."

Kamar-kamarnya tidak dilengkapi dengan baik. Kamar mandinya hanya memiliki satu gantungan untuk menggantung pakaian basah. Kamar tidurnya tidak memiliki laci dan hanya satu rak dengan ketinggian yang cukup mudah diakses. Saya menyimpan semua pakaian dalam dan baju renang saya di kamar mandi; tidak ada tempat untuk menyimpannya di kamar tidur. Kompleks ini secara keseluruhan sangat membutuhkan renovasi. Hampir semua tikar pantai di pantai rusak. Sangat tidak direkomendasikan! Sayang sekali, padahal seharusnya bisa lebih baik."

Bapak-bapak manajer, ini abad ke-21, dan hotel ini masih seperti di pertengahan abad lalu. Restoran Gading di HF dan FB kurang memuaskan saat memesan a la carte. Burgernya, seperti yang disebutkan sebelumnya dalam ulasan, sebenarnya hanya akan disukai oleh anjing, tidak semua anjing. Kentangnya sudah tua, basi, dan berbintik-bintik hitam. Anak itu menjalani diet bebas gluten, tidak ada pasta BG di menu, dan tidak ada pasta yang diminta. Mereka memasak mi lokal yang lebar, ketika saya meminta lebih matang, karena anak itu tidak mau makan bubur mi, juru masaknya menolak. Apakah sesulit itu untuk membuangnya ke dalam wajan dan melakukan apa yang diminta? Mungkin, tetapi tidak di tempat ini dan tidak dengan layanan ini. Saat sarapan, BG menolak menyediakan makanan, mereka menawarkan untuk mulai keesokan harinya, meskipun hotel telah diperingatkan sebelumnya dan juga sehari sebelumnya. Saya harus bersikeras dan sarapan BG akhirnya muncul dan orang yang menangani masalah ini berubah dan semuanya menjadi baik-baik saja. Kesimpulan - masalahnya ada pada staf. Secara umum, kami tidak merekomendasikan restoran ini sama sekali. Air, bahkan lokal - dibayar di wilayah hotel dan lebih mahal daripada di Dubai bintang lima yang bagus di Jumeirah (meskipun mereka menyediakan air dengan es di pantai gratis). Harga seperti di restoran yang bagus untuk minuman, sementara kualitasnya jauh dari ideal. Ada kekurangan kursi berjemur yang parah, meskipun faktanya wilayahnya luas dan memungkinkan Anda untuk meletakkannya dengan bebas. Kerugian besar bagi manajemen untuk ini. Pusat kebugaran adalah yang terkecil dari semua yang saya temui di ratusan hotel 5 * tempat saya menginap. Dua trek, satu elips dan satu multifungsi dengan dumbel. Itu saja. Sulit membayangkan bagaimana komisi melewatkan momen seperti itu untuk sertifikasi hotel berperingkat lima. Kamar dan kamar mandi yang luas (meskipun beberapa keran airnya berbau dan mixer perlu diganti) pancuran - tekanannya lemah. Juga minus AC berfungsi dengan baik. Tempat tidurnya nyaman, bantalnya kurang nyaman. Balkonnya kecil dan sempit. Restoran di bawah lobi cukup sukses. Saya menyukai layanan dan kualitas hidangannya. Lima yang solid untuk setiap hidangan. Namun, munculnya lalat kotoran di piring berisi makanan menunjukkan masalah kebersihan di dapur dan pembuangan sampah di area hotel. Lalat selalu ada di tempat yang terdapat kotoran organik - minus bagi manajemen. Pantainya adalah salah satu yang terbaik, tetapi itu bukan kelebihan hotel. Tersedia peralatan untuk berselancar. Dengan biaya tambahan. Konsep klub anak-anak mirip dengan pusat kebugaran (kecil dan tanpa anak-anak). Secara umum, manajemen perlu melakukan perbaikan dan semuanya akan baik-baik saja."
"597.","Natalie Wong","2","2025-01-14","1","Kami punya pengalaman buruk di hotel bintang 5 ini. Hotel ini sama sekali tidak sepadan dengan harganya, kamar dengan pemandangan kolam renang kurang privasi karena orang-orang yang berenang di sekitar kolam dapat dengan mudah melihat kami melalui kaca transparan, handuk kotor, dan wastafel yang buruk (pada dasarnya penuh dengan barang-barang lain), bak mandinya kurang bersih.

Lobi sangat luas dan bagus, hotel ini memiliki banyak ruang terbuka yang luas dan pemandangan indah ke kolam renang dan pantai. Stafnya ramah. Kami menginap 3 malam, malam pertama menyenangkan, kamarnya agak ketinggalan jaman untuk hotel bintang 5, tetapi secara keseluruhan, ini adalah awal yang baik. Lalu, kami mencoba sarapannya, tidak sepadan, banyak pilihan, tetapi sangat rata-rata. Saat itulah kami mengetahui bahwa hotel tersebut menyelenggarakan kompetisi game internasional….mereka mulai membangun panggung dan berbagai tenda di seluruh hotel…selamat tinggal pemandangan pantai, halo pemandangan banyak konstruksi yang sedang berlangsung. Kami tidak lagi berada di hotel bintang 5, melainkan di aula pameran…yang bisa Anda lihat hanyalah konstruksi di mana-mana, dari kolam renang, dari pantai, hanya itu yang bisa Anda lihat. Sangat kecewa, kami tidak berada di surga kecil kami sendiri, melainkan di sebuah acara game…. Selain itu, hanya disediakan 1 gel mandi per kamar, tidak ada mandi busa, yang sangat disayangkan mengingat bak mandi yang begitu bagus. Itu saja belum cukup, Anda mengharapkan lebih dari hotel bintang 5. Restorannya sangat biasa saja dan harganya terlalu mahal. Kamarnya nyaman tetapi agak ketinggalan jaman, tidak memberikan kesan bintang 5. Para kontestan tiba dengan bus di hotel, lobi yang sangat ramai, tidak membuat Anda merasa seperti berada di hotel bintang 5. Stafnya kurang terlatih, ramah, tetapi kurang efisien. Sangat mengecewakan, saya membayar untuk akhir pekan panjang yang damai, dengan pemandangan pantai...itu sama sekali bukan yang saya dapatkan."

Saat kami menunggu di lobi, mereka tidak menawarkan minuman atau apa pun. Bahkan air putih pun tidak. 3. Kamar di lantai satu berbau jamur yang sangat menyengat. Mereka memindahkan kami ke lantai dua. 4. Lantai dua berbau limbah, wastafel tidak bisa disiram, dan AC-nya hampir tidak berfungsi. 5. Petugas kebersihan hanya datang sesekali, jadi kami harus memanggil mereka. 6. Restoran lokalnya berbeda cerita. Harganya keterlaluan. Satu porsi makanan harganya 200.000 rubel. Harganya 4 kali lebih murah di mana pun di Bali. Makanannya menjijikkan untuk harga segitu. Suasana di restorannya menjijikkan. Banyak sekali lalat. 7. Namun yang paling menyedihkan adalah, tidak ada kafe yang layak untuk makan dalam jarak berjalan kaki. Bahkan tidak ada toko. Pantai terdekat berjarak 3 kilometer di pinggir jalan. Kelebihan: 1. Pantai yang indah. Pantai terbaik di Bali. 2. Kolam renang yang luas. Namun, wajib hukumnya bagi anak-anak. 3. Internet yang bagus di seluruh area properti."
"600.","Luca Ricciardi","110","2024-01-14","1","Jika Anda mencari surga dan relaksasi, Anda pasti tidak akan menemukannya di sini. Kami tiba larut malam dan diperiksa di pintu masuk seolah-olah kami berada di bandara. Setiap barang bawaan diperiksa seolah-olah kami teroris. Disambut di gedung yang megah, kami diantar ke gedung 4 di lantai empat. Kamarnya bagus, agak usang (terlalu usang), tanpa stopkontak di dekat tempat tidur, dan balkonnya bagus (perlu diketahui bahwa hanya lantai empat yang memiliki balkon besar; jika Anda kurang beruntung mendapatkan kamar di lantai dua atau tiga, Anda akan mendapatkan balkon kecil). Kedap suaranya buruk, dan kami bisa mendengar percakapan normal di kamar lain. Kami mendapat kamar di dekat lift (sangat stres!); setiap kali pintu dibuka, pintunya akan berdering. Bayangkan tinggal di gedung dengan lebih dari 50 kamar dan konser seperti itu bisa terdengar (setelah dua hari mengeluh, mereka memindahkan gedung saya dan menempatkan saya lebih jauh dari lift). Sayang sekali AC di kamar berhenti bekerja setelah seharian. Diperbaiki dengan perawatan selama lima jam (apalagi air berceceran di mana-mana, di baju, koper... sungguh bencana). Manajemen segera meminta maaf, memberi kami cokelat sebagai permintaan maaf (mungkin ganti kamar?). Keesokan harinya, bau tak sedap tercium dari pipa-pipa (apalagi bangun di selokan saja sudah luar biasa). Solusi brilian hotel? Sedikit deodoran dan semuanya baik-baik saja. Para amatir di luar sana. Pantainya...luas, indah, dengan lautan warna-warni yang indah. Sayang sekali pantainya dipenuhi plastik. Saya bertanya kepada pihak hotel mengapa tidak dibersihkan, dan alasan yang mereka berikan lebih buruk daripada kebenaran: Kami membersihkan pantai dua kali sehari, salah alam kalau plastik meninggalkannya. Ya sudahlah. Nyatanya, semuanya mengapung di laut. Sandal jepit, gelas, peralatan makan, ransel, sikat gigi—saya rasa luar biasa untuk pantai yang menyebut dirinya pulau surga (mungkin lebih tepatnya pulau sampah!). Saya terhibur karena, berbicara dengan orang Italia lainnya, pantai-pantai lain di pulau ini bahkan lebih buruk! Hotel ini setidaknya memiliki kolam renang yang indah dan terawat dengan staf yang sangat ramah. Mungkin kolam renang anak-anak, dengan airnya yang sangat keruh, sebaiknya tidak digunakan... Sarapannya luar biasa, berlimpah (agak repetitif...), tetapi sangat enak. Bahkan ada kapel kaca yang indah tempat Anda bisa menikah (kami sudah membayar, kalau tidak, itu akan menjadi ide yang bagus). Kami telah melihat beberapa pernikahan dirayakan, yang sungguh indah (sayang sekali menemukan halaman tertutup plastik dan tidak pernah dibersihkan selama berhari-hari). Mereka bahkan bisa melakukannya tanpa koktail selamat datang; itu segelas es dengan sedikit teh; akan lebih baik jika Anda tidak menyediakannya. Ide menyediakan botol air kaca (330ml) di kamar sangat bagus. Hotel ini terletak tak jauh dari semacam pusat perbelanjaan turis kecil dengan apotek, tetapi jika Anda keluar dari area parkir karyawan dan kemudian menuju Nusa Dua, ada jalan kecil lain dengan harga yang jauh lebih murah. Intinya: jika Anda berpikir untuk datang ke sini demi pantai, lupakan saja. Anda akan menghabiskan waktu di kolam renang (dan tidak perlu datang sejauh ini hanya untuk bersantai di kolam renang). Jika Anda menggunakannya untuk mengunjungi pulau, lupakan saja. Jaraknya dua jam dari mana-mana, dan saya sarankan memesan hotel di utara pulau. Lautnya penuh dengan plastik. Menginap di Merusaka (seperti halnya area Nusa Dua lainnya) pada dasarnya berarti menginap di tempat yang harganya lima kali lipat lebih mahal, dan Anda akan menghabiskan waktu bertanya-tanya, Untuk apa saya datang?"
"601.","Valeriia Podolian","10","2024-01-14","1","Satu-satunya hal positif dari hotel ini adalah lokasinya yang dekat dengan pantai dan laut. Pantainya indah dan bersih, dan tersedia kursi berjemur di bawah pohon. Hanya itu saja. Hotelnya sendiri besar dan berfokus bukan pada akomodasi berkualitas, melainkan pada jumlah tamu yang memenuhi kamar. Kamar mandinya selalu berbau limbah, dan kerannya bocor. Kulkas di kamar terasa panas, sehingga mustahil untuk meninggalkan buah atau obat di dalamnya. Kami meminta agar kulkas diperbaiki, dan seorang petugas datang dan menyesuaikan suhunya. Dan tidak ada yang berubah. Harga makan siang dan makan malam lebih mahal daripada di hotel Hilton dan Radission. Pelayanannya lambat dan tidak menyenangkan. Kami meminta buah yang harus kami potong dan diberitahu bahwa kami harus membayarnya. Ketika kami membayar dan meminta garpu untuk buah tersebut, kami diberitahu bahwa kami tidak boleh makan buah di mana pun kecuali di dalam kamar agar tidak ada orang lain yang melihat. Kami harus meminta garpu secara terpisah dari layanan kamar. Saya juga sempat bermasalah dengan pelayan ketika saya memintanya untuk tidak menambahkan lada ke makanan saya karena saya punya alergi. Pria itu membawa paprika tanpa paprika dan meninggalkan sedikit cabai di sana. 🤷🏻‍♀️. Bangunannya sendiri sudah tua dan perlu sedikit perbaikan kosmetik, begitu pula kolam renangnya. Hotel ini sering menyelenggarakan berbagai acara untuk 100-200 orang. Musiknya mengalun kencang di seluruh hotel, terkadang bahkan di malam hari. Jika Anda mencari liburan yang santai, saya sangat tidak merekomendasikannya. Beberapa hari saja sudah cukup, tetapi tidak lebih dari seminggu. Saya tidak akan kembali ke sini lagi."
"602.","Jane","18","2024-01-14","1","Untuk harga segitu, kita bayar untuk pantainya. Ya, itu saja. Kamar yang kami tempati sangat tidak terawat. Baunya pengap dan ada noda-noda yang mencurigakan. Tempat tidur king yang katanya cuma dua tempat tidur yang digabung jadi satu. Nozel shower juga rusak. Tapi mungkin yang paling parah adalah AC-nya. Sama sekali tidak dingin. Dan dengan cuaca Bali seperti ini, kita benar-benar butuh AC yang bagus. Saya sudah menghubungi petugas pemeliharaan untuk memperbaikinya, tapi mereka hanya membersihkan filternya sebentar tanpa benar-benar menyelesaikan masalah. Sarapannya kontinental, tapi jangan berharap banyak."

"604.","Franck Lavisse","64","2025-01-14","1","Mungkin hotel terburuk di Nusa Dua. Pertama, resepsionisnya hanya menatap komputernya selama 10 menit tanpa bicara, sambutannya sungguh tidak hangat… Lalu, pelayanan di restorannya buruk. Dua kali saya memesan segelas anggur merah dari Australia, dan pelayan datang dengan anggur merah dua pulau dari Bali… Sering kali dalam seminggu, garpu dan pisau kami hilang di meja, kami harus meminta bantuan mereka, sungguh luar biasa. Untuk sarapan, ada antrean dan kami harus menunggu lama sebelum mendapatkan meja (tanpa peralatan makan tentunya). Prasmanannya juga tidak dikelola dengan baik, sering kali barang-barang hilang. Mereka butuh 10 menit untuk mengisi ulang bacon, dll. Hotelnya sangat berisik dengan banyak anak-anak yang berlarian dan berteriak. Di kamar tidur kami, ada masalah dengan shower dan saya mulai berisik pada pukul 7 pagi. 2 kali mereka membersihkan kamar saya setelah pukul 3 sore, meskipun saya sudah memasang tanda tolong bersihkan pada pukul 8 pagi. Saya bahkan harus komplain ke resepsionis karena kamar saya baru dibersihkan pukul 3 sore. Saya menulis ini pukul 3:12 sore di depan kamar saya, sementara petugasnya masih membersihkan. Saya memesan kopi di kolam renang, dan butuh 10 menit untuk sampai. Begitu juga dengan kelapa. Mereka punya happy hour dari pukul 5 sampai 7, tetapi mereka bilang tutup pukul 6:30. Singkat cerita, pelayanannya buruk dan sama sekali tidak sepadan dengan harganya."
"605.","Natalie A","17","2024-01-14","1","Resor ini sama sekali bukan resor ramah keluarga. Jika Anda berencana membawa keluarga, jangan. Klub anak-anak sangat buruk - ruangannya kecil dengan AC yang hampir tidak berfungsi, dan beberapa mainan lama berserakan. Tidak ada kegiatan yang direncanakan untuk anak-anak sama sekali dan hanya buka pukul 9-5. Cuacanya terlalu panas untuk meninggalkan anak-anak di sana. Menu lengkapnya sangat terbatas. Sarapan prasmanannya biasa saja. Stafnya ramah. Ukuran kamarnya cukup besar. Tamu-tamu lain sama sekali tidak ramah. Orang-orang tampaknya tidak menyukai anak-anak di sini meskipun ini adalah resor keluarga. Saya dibuat merasa sangat tidak nyaman dan terancam beberapa kali. Saya tidak akan menginap di sini lagi."
"606.","Nikolai Kolesnikov","5","2025-01-14","1","Saat tiba dari bandara di resepsionis, mereka mencoba memaksa kami untuk membayar sarapan putra kami. Saya menghabiskan 15 menit untuk membuktikan bahwa sarapan sudah termasuk. Kami tidak membawa rupee atau kartu bank, hanya dolar, mereka ingin kami membayar dengan rupee atau menukarkannya dengan kurs yang tidak menguntungkan. Kami sepakat bahwa saya akan meninggalkan deposit dan membayar besok. Keesokan paginya, saat sarapan di restoran, mereka kembali mencoba mengambil uang untuk putra saya dan saya kembali harus membuktikan bahwa sarapan putra saya sudah dibayar. Pukul 10:30 pagi setelah sarapan, kami tidak bisa masuk ke kamar karena mereka memblokir kartu kunci kami; saya dan istri saya bersama seorang anak berusia satu tahun dan seorang anak berusia enam tahun di jalan tidak bisa masuk ke kamar. Sungguh sikap yang mengerikan terhadap kami, saya bahkan tidak punya waktu untuk menukar uang, meskipun saya sudah meninggalkan deposit. Mengapa saya harus membayar banyak uang? Pelayanan terburuk dalam hidup saya, saya tidak akan pernah kembali ke hotel ini."
"607.","Aleksandra","29","2024-01-14","1","Saya menginap di hotel Merusaka Nusa Dua benar-benar bencana. Meskipun ratingnya bintang lima dan standarnya tinggi, stafnya ternyata sama sekali tidak jujur. Departemen rumah tangga sangat tidak dapat dipercaya, MENCURI UANG dari kamar selama pembersihan. Dan apa yang diusulkan pihak keamanan? Mereka menyarankan untuk menginventarisasi ruangan dan memotret semua yang dimiliki tamu, hanya untuk membuktikan bahwa tamu tersebut salah meletakkan barang yang hilang. Ini sungguh tidak masuk akal! Ini cara sempurna untuk membuktikan bahwa uang telah hilang??? Meskipun makanan di hotel enak, keseluruhan pengalaman dirusak oleh ketidakpuasan yang terjadi sepanjang waktu. Restoran itu benar-benar kacau - saya menunggu selama 30 menit untuk kopi pesanan saya, dan meja-mejanya sering kali kotor dan tidak dibersihkan. Bahkan mendapatkan pisau dan garpu membutuhkan waktu lama. Dan toilet di kamar saya hanyalah sebuah tragedi. Itu bocor, dan flushnya rusak. Saya melaporkannya tiga kali selama lima hari saya tinggal, dan tidak ada tindakan apa pun mengenai hal itu. Bayangkan, di hotel bintang 5, mereka tidak bisa memperbaiki toilet! Tapi bukan itu saja. Hanya menyediakan satu handuk besar untuk kamar dengan dua orang? Dengan serius? Masalah lainnya adalah kekurangan menu. Saya akan bertanya tentang suatu hidangan, mereka akan mengatakan mereka memilikinya, tetapi ketika saya datang setelah satu jam, ternyata hidangan tersebut tidak tersedia. Selain itu, pantainya penuh dengan DRONE, dan staf tidak melakukan kontrol apa pun. Saya harus menahan suara mendengung sepanjang hari. Dan yang lebih buruk lagi, mereka mengizinkan pengunjung pantai untuk syuting di pantai hotel pribadi! Dimana privasi dan keamanan para tamu? Singkatnya, pengalaman menginap saya di hotel Merusaka Nusa Dua adalah mimpi buruk. Saya tidak bisa merekomendasikan tempat ini kepada siapa pun. Standar yang tinggi tidak berarti apa-apa jika stafnya tidak jujur, makanannya meninggalkan rasa tidak enak, toiletnya rusak, dan kurangnya pengaturan dan kontrol menghalangi relaksasi."
"608.","TripOnPixel Cinematic","46","2025-01-14","1","Tamu saya, Tn. Cho Dong Min, menginap di kamar kategori vila dengan kolam renang pribadi, tetapi kolam renangnya adalah kolam renang kecil. Ketika saya membantu tamu saya untuk meminta teh sore dan koktail malam disajikan di kamar, Butler bernama MESHA menolak permintaan tersebut dengan tegas tanpa ada isyarat mewah atau layanan penuh perhatian. Sepertinya dia perlu dilatih untuk terlibat dengan tamu atau perwakilan tamu dalam hal keterlibatan mewah. Tamu tersebut membutuhkan teh sore dan koktail malam untuk disajikan di vila karena mereka memiliki layanan pijat yang termasuk pada pukul 3 sore dan akan berakhir pada pukul 4 sore, mereka perlu beristirahat dan menikmati vila mereka alih-alih menikmati restoran. Ini adalah hotel bintang 5, bukan bintang 3 atau bintang 4, jadi daripada menolak permintaan tamu, Mesha lebih baik mencari cara untuk mengakomodasi permintaan tamu. Dia bahkan tidak memanggil staf terkait yang akan menyajikan teh sore dan koktail malam, tetapi menolak dengan tegas dan menunjukkan sikap arogan."
"609.","Victor Hugo Cruz","9","2024-01-14","1","Hotelnya bagus, sarapannya agak buruk, tetapi bagian terburuknya adalah pantainya. Sudah umum diketahui bahwa Bali cenderung tercemar, tetapi tidak seperti hotel lain yang membersihkan pantai tepat di depan mereka, Merusaka membiarkan sampah menumpuk begitu saja. Mungkin mereka kekurangan staf, tetapi itu benar-benar merusak pengalaman hotel bintang 5. Mengapa tidak ikut serta dan membantu lingkungan dengan memungut semua sampah plastik dan styrofoam yang berserakan di pantai?"
"610.","Shaun Norden","12","2024-01-14","1","Jangan buang waktu dan uang Anda. Ulasan ini berdasarkan pengalaman kami dan hotel-hotel tersebut mengklaim sebagai Fasilitas Bintang 5. Mari kita mulai dengan hal-hal baiknya: - Kolam renang di area umum sangat bagus, tamannya sangat indah. Akses pantai sangat baik. Seperti biasa, orang Bali sangat ramah. Itulah sifat alami mereka yang ingin menyenangkan Anda. Hal itu terjadi di seluruh pulau dan bukan hanya di hotel ini. - Lokasi ke distrik perbelanjaan sekitar 700 m berjalan kaki - Wanita yang mengelola restoran ketika Anda meminta meja sangat ramah 10/10. - Kekurangannya: - Dekorasi kamar sudah tua, usang, dan perlu diperbarui agar mendekati bintang 5. - TV menggunakan layanan streaming berbasis jaringan yang terus-menerus gagal, kualitas streamingnya buruk dan membuat frustrasi karena sangat lambat. Acara sering terputus. Sebagai seorang IT, ini adalah masalah infrastruktur jaringan. Streaming multicast & unicast membebani jaringan. AC-nya bikin tenggorokan kering, bangun pagi-pagi banget sakit tenggorokan, nggak bisa matiin AC karena kamar jadi panas banget. Kamar kami punya kolam renang langsung, ada jamur hitam di dek kolam renang dan sampai ke kolam renang. Kenapa harus memasukkan kayu ke air kolam? Sejujurnya, ini pilihan yang buruk dari pihak yang membangun. Dan mengganggu kalau mau bersantai di kolam renang. Pancuran kamarnya nggak berfungsi sama sekali. Sarapannya kayak perkemahan sekolah, berisik anak-anak dan nggak ada AC. Makanannya kayak sizzler, roti dan kue keringnya dibekukan terus dipanaskan ulang. Kalau beli sesuatu di sini, beli telur aja. Makanan lainnya kualitasnya jelek, untuk ukuran hotel bintang 5. Yang paling buruk: -Ada konstruksi di sebelah kamar kami selama jam kerja. Suara dentuman dan gesekan terus-menerus. Waktu kami komplain, kami dikasih tahu kalau kamarnya bakal berhenti jam 5 sore. Waktu kami minta kamar lain, kami dikasih tahu kalau kamarnya sudah penuh. Saya menghubungi manajer hotel yang mengaku ditawari kamar lain di hari pertama. Intinya, kami lebih suka menginap di kamar yang berisik. Sejujurnya, kami tidak percaya dengan tanggapan ini. Intinya, seluruh pengalaman ini adalah kesalahan kami. Ringkasan: Ada banyak hotel bagus di Nusa Dua dengan harga segitu. Saran saya, pergilah ke tempat lain saja dan Anda akan mendapatkan pengalaman yang lebih baik. Kami ditawari satu malam gratis untuk kembali ke hotel ini. Saya lebih suka mendapatkan kembali sebagian uang saya karena kami merasa benar-benar ditipu saat kami pergi. Kami baru saja kembali dari Anantara di Uluwatu, menikmati pengalaman yang berbeda siang dan malam dengan harga yang kurang lebih sama. Anantara jauh lebih unggul dari tempat ini."
"611.","Philipp Kreysa","2","2023-01-14","1","Meskipun Hotelnya bagus, begitu ada masalah, Staf tidak mampu mengatasinya. Setelah tiba dari perjalanan 17 jam dengan 2 anak, kami dipesan ke kamar dengan AC rusak. Setelah melaporkan hal ini pada malam yang sama, kami masih harus tinggal di kamar itu sampai keesokan harinya. Setiap orang tua dengan 2 anak yang kelelahan tahu bahwa ini adalah mimpi buruk! Keesokan harinya kami pindah ke kamar yang satu lantai dengan - tetapi lebih tua dan bahkan kurang terawat. Akhirnya saat check out ketika meminta untuk mengakomodasi kami atas ketidaknyamanan kami, kami pada dasarnya diberitahu oleh manajemen bahwa AC yang rusak bukanlah masalah mereka dan mereka sudah mengakomodasi kami dengan pindah kamar. Saya kira menurut pendapat mereka kita seharusnya tinggal di kamar dengan AC yang rusak! Pengalaman yang benar-benar menjengkelkan dan tidak ada rasa pelayanan untuk tempat semahal itu! Saya tidak merekomendasikan menginap - ada Hotel bagus serupa dengan layanan yang lebih baik!"
"612.","Gompi Flores","6","2024-01-14","1","Hari ini hari pertama saya di hotel ini dan saya sangat kecewa dengan kamar yang diberikan. Saya akan mulai dengan mengatakan bahwa AC-nya rusak dan meneteskan air. Saya menelepon resepsionis dan mereka membawakan saya keset kamar mandi untuk lantai. Gagang shower rusak dan selang showernya kotor dan berkarat. Bagi saya, ini bukan hotel bintang 5. Saya meminta kamar lain dan mereka memberi saya sejuta alasan agar saya tidak jadi bertanya. Makanannya sangat asin dan tidak enak. Semoga kunjungan saya di sini terbayar dengan menjelajahi Bali."

Atau apakah mereka mengabaikan saya karena saya tidak bisa berbahasa Inggris dengan baik? Mereka mengirim saya ke kamar dengan AC yang rusak. Tukang reparasi AC datang, tetapi setelah 30 menit, AC-nya masih belum diperbaiki. Mereka bilang AC akan dingin jika saya menunggu 30 menit hingga satu jam lagi, tetapi saya tidak percaya. Saya dan keluarga saya berkeringat deras di kamar, tidak bisa mandi. Ketika saya meminta untuk pindah kamar, mereka tidak merespons. Saya meminta mereka untuk datang dan memeriksa, tetapi mereka tidak datang. Satu jam kemudian, saya mengeluh ke resepsionis, dan mereka hanya memberi saya satu kamar. Mereka bilang akan memeriksa ulang dan memberi saya kamar, tetapi satu jam berlalu dan mereka masih belum mendapat kabar. Saya menelepon dan marah, dan baru setelah itu mereka memberi saya kunci. Ngomong-ngomong, kamar tempat saya pindah juga tidak sejuk. Saya sudah menginap di delapan hotel di Bali, dan saya tidak habis pikir kenapa hotel bintang lima bisa punya kondisi kamar, layanan resepsionis, dan pelayanan yang begitu buruk dibandingkan hotel kelas bawah. Orang Korea seharusnya lebih hemat dan pergi ke tempat lain. Pemandangan dan akses pantainya bagus."

Yang saya tidak mengerti adalah parkirnya ada di dalam hotel (jadi tidak umum) dan mereka punya petugas keamanan, tetapi tidak ada kamera di area ini. Jadi, harap berhati-hati saat berkendara dengan mobil atau motor. Jika terjadi pencurian, itu bukan tanggung jawab mereka."

Di tengah terik matahari yang mencapai hampir 4 derajat Celcius, kami mendapati diri kami berada di kamar dengan AC, kulkas, dan kipas angin yang tidak berfungsi. Hal ini membuat kami sangat tidak nyaman, terutama dengan anak-anak. Kami segera melaporkan masalah ini, dan meskipun teknisi telah dikirim ke kamar kami dua kali, masalah tersebut tetap tidak terselesaikan. Kurangnya respons yang efektif ini mengecewakan dan menambah ketidaknyamanan kami. Di tengah ketidaknyamanan ini, pihak hotel menawarkan kamar alternatif pada pukul 1 dini hari. Namun, kamar yang ditawarkan berada di gedung yang berbeda, yang bukan solusi praktis bagi kami yang bepergian dengan anak-anak. Secara keseluruhan, layanan di Merusaka Nusa Dua mengecewakan. Kegagalan untuk segera memperbaiki fasilitas penting, ditambah dengan solusi yang kurang memuaskan yang ditawarkan, sangat memengaruhi pengalaman menginap kami. Saya berharap mendapatkan pengalaman yang jauh lebih baik, terutama mengingat reputasi tempat ini."

Saya memesan hotel ini dengan harapan akan mendapatkan pengalaman menginap yang spektakuler mengingat semua ulasan bagus yang kami lihat di internet. Sayangnya, sejauh ini kami mengalami pengalaman menginap yang sangat tidak menyenangkan. Kamar saya dan suami terasa sangat panas saat masuk. Kami pikir AC akan menyala setelah beberapa jam, tetapi ternyata tidak. Suhu di luar mencapai 30 derajat Fahrenheit dan kamar kami bahkan lebih panas lagi. Saya menelepon resepsionis pukul 18.30 untuk memberi tahu mereka. Kami pergi makan malam dan kembali ke hotel pukul 22.00, tetapi ternyata belum diperbaiki. Jadi saya menelepon kembali untuk memberi tahu mereka. Kami menunggu hampir satu jam untuk mendapatkan kamar pengganti, hanya untuk mendapatkan kamar lain dengan AC yang setengah rusak dan panas. Jadi kami menunggu lagi selama 40 menit dan saat itu hampir pukul 24.00, tetapi akhirnya mereka memberi kami kamar dengan AC yang berfungsi. Sayangnya, kamar tersebut memiliki bau cat dinding/kayu yang menyengat dan kamar itu adalah kamar dengan dua tempat tidur. Kami sudah terlalu lelah saat itu karena sudah mendekati tengah malam, jadi kami memutuskan untuk menuruti saja. Pengalaman yang sangat mengecewakan dan sungguh tidak menyangka akan mendapatkan pengalaman seperti ini dari hotel bintang 5 yang populer. Kami sudah beberapa kali ke Bali dan menginap di banyak hotel bintang 5 di seluruh pulau, tetapi belum pernah mengalami pengalaman yang tidak memuaskan seperti ini. Kami pasti tidak akan kembali."

PS: Staf awalnya baik, tetapi kemudian manajer jaga tim datang dan bahkan tidak meminta maaf atas ketidaknyamanan yang kami alami. Jangan juga meng-upgrade kamar dengan akses kolam renang menjadi lebih baik daripada kamar deluxe meskipun harganya lebih mahal."

Kami mengalami pengalaman buruk hari ini: Suami saya dan saya tiba di kolam renang pukul 8.30, pergi ke konter handuk, dan seorang pria berpakaian seperti staf keluar dan mengambil uang tunai 300.000. Dia memberi kami dua handuk dan bilang akan membawakan vouchernya nanti. Kami berbaring di kursi santai, tetapi tidak ada yang membawakan voucher untuk kami. Tiga jam kemudian, kami pergi ke konter sendiri, diantar ke bar, lalu kembali ke konter. Kami berjalan-jalan seperti itu selama sekitar 30 menit. Seluruh staf keluar dan mulai menuduh kami tidak membayar biaya menginap karena mereka tidak dapat menemukan pria yang mengambil uang kami. Ketika kami meminta untuk memeriksa kamera CCTV, mereka bilang tidak ada. Suasana hati kami hancur. Jika staf mencuri, hadapi stafnya, jangan salahkan tamu karena tidak membayar tagihan! Parahnya lagi, pas kami lagi panik-paniknya dan mau masuk ke mobil, stafnya malah lari ke arah kami dan nanya handuknya dicuri. Ini benar-benar gagal total, teman-teman. Perlakuan kayak gini ke tamu nggak bisa diterima!"

"623.","Markus Hornung","3","2024-01-14","1","Saya baru-baru ini menginap di Hotel Merusaka di Nusa Dua dan itu benar-benar mimpi buruk!!! Stafnya benar-benar tidak kompeten dan tidak tahu bagaimana menangani masalah-masalah mendasar. Ketika kami tiba, kamar saya belum siap dan saya harus menunggu lama sebelum akhirnya mendapatkan kamar yang kotor dan bau dengan pancuran yang rusak. Ketika saya mengeluh, mereka memberi saya kamar lain yang tepat di sebelah sebuah pesta yang ramai, jadi saya tidak bisa tidur sama sekali. Bahkan setelah tiga kali mencoba, mereka tidak dapat memberi kami kamar yang sesuai dan seluruh prosesnya memakan waktu tiga jam. Lebih parah lagi, staf terus-menerus berjalan mondar-mandir di koridor dan berbicara di walkie-talkie mereka hingga larut malam, jadi saya tidak bisa tidur bahkan saat itu. Jelas bahwa hotel ini tidak memperhatikan kebutuhan tamunya dan kurang terorganisir. Secara keseluruhan, saya sangat menyarankan siapa pun untuk menghindari Hotel Merusaka di Nusa Dua. Ada banyak hotel lain di area ini yang menawarkan layanan pelanggan yang lebih baik, lingkungan yang lebih bersih, dan pengalaman yang lebih menyenangkan. Hotel ini adalah bencana dan mimpi buruk bagi siapa pun yang menginginkan liburan yang santai. Pertama-tama, stafnya jelas tidak mampu menyambut tamu dengan baik dan memenuhi kebutuhan mereka. Kenyataan bahwa kami harus menunggu untuk check-in ke kamar yang kotor dan bau saat tiba di hotel sungguh tidak dapat diterima. Saat kami menunggu kamar di restoran, kami disambut oleh staf yang arogan dan tidak kompeten. Bahkan setelah saya mengeluh dan diberi kamar baru, hal itu tetap tidak dapat diterima, karena letaknya di sebelah tempat pesta yang ramai. Staf yang berjalan di lorong di tengah malam dengan suara yang sangat keras juga tidak dapat diterima. Ini menunjukkan bahwa hotel tidak memperhatikan kebutuhan tamunya dan benar-benar tidak terorganisir. Secara keseluruhan, Hotel Merusaka di Nusa Dua sayangnya benar-benar mimpi buruk, dan saya sangat menyarankan untuk menghindarinya.

"624.","Brooke Marr","1","2021-01-14","1","Sejujurnya saya tidak tahu mengapa tempat ini mendapat peringkat yang begitu tinggi. Setelah menghabiskan lebih dari seminggu di Bali dan 3 resor lainnya, ini JAUH lebih mahal dari semuanya, dan paling tidak bernilai uang. Sangat mengecewakan. Pertama, kami tidak diizinkan check-in sedetik pun sebelum pukul 15.00, yang sudah sangat buruk. Kedua, karena kami tidak bisa check-in, kami harus berkeliling selama 10 menit sambil membawa ransel berisi perlengkapan fotografi yang tampaknya mencurigakan bagi petugas keamanan di area tersebut, sehingga kami diinterogasi dengan kasar apakah kami tamu di sini. Membayar lebih dari 500 NZD selama 2 malam untuk dibuat merasa seperti penjahat adalah kesan pertama yang menjijikkan. Kami melanjutkan berjalan-jalan di sekitar area tersebut. Tempatnya tidak terlalu kotor atau semacamnya, tetapi jelas BUKAN seperti yang terlihat di foto. Pada dasarnya, tempat ini adalah lapangan terbuka yang luas dan kosong dengan kolam renang sederhana dan seratus kursi berjemur yang dipadatkan di beberapa area kecil dengan tempat sampah yang meluap. Sepertinya tidak ada perhatian terhadap detail di sini karena semuanya sangat sangat sederhana. Lalu, setelah dibawa ke kamar kami yang sangat gelap dan kuno dengan 2 tempat tidur single yang disatukan, saya benar-benar kecewa dengan gagasan untuk menghabiskan sisa 2 hari liburan yang luar biasa di sini. Saya pergi ke resepsionis dengan harapan mendapatkan pengembalian dana agar kami bisa pergi ke tempat lain. Tidak ada bantuan sama sekali. Mereka hanya menawarkan kamar yang berbeda, kategori yang sama tetapi dengan tempat tidur ganda. Bahkan, kamar ini memiliki setengah dari kolam renang (yang tidak terlalu pribadi) karena kami menghadap ke area yang sangat kecil dan dinding bata! Yang bisa saya katakan adalah, kesan yang kami rasakan di sini adalah Anda bukan pelanggan yang berharga, Anda hanyalah nomor lain yang datang. Tidak ada upaya yang dilakukan untuk mengubah pandangan kami terhadap resor ini. Jika Anda pasangan dan mencari sesuatu yang romantis DAN jika Anda ingin merasa seperti berada di Bali, jangan buang-buang uang Anda. Resor lain di dekatnya adalah Melia Bali yang harganya setengahnya dan benar-benar indah!!!! Mereka sangat memperhatikan detail di area mereka dan staf mereka sangat berterima kasih atas kunjungan Anda. Inaya Putri terasa seperti berada di tempat lain di dunia, tetapi rasanya sama sekali tidak seperti Bali. Dua hari terakhir liburan yang begitu indah di Bali sungguh mengecewakan. Saya sangat sedih karena harus pulang, tetapi sekarang saya tidak sabar."
"625.","Nico Griesbaum","3","2023-01-14","1","Resornya lumayan, kecuali faktanya cukup sering ada perusahaan yang menginap di sana dengan jumlah karyawan yang banyak untuk merayakan sesuatu (berpesta). Minggu lalu, sekelompok besar karyawan dari sebuah perusahaan membuat keributan yang sangat mengganggu sepanjang hari di pantai (musik yang sangat keras, pengumuman, permainan, dll.). Kami terpaksa meninggalkan pantai. Kemarin malam, sekelompok besar orang mengadakan pesta di gedung yang sangat dekat dengan kamar kami. Musiknya lagi-lagi sangat keras dan mengganggu. Hari ini, Jumat, waktunya berpesta lagi, artinya selama 4 hari dari jam 6 sore, kami tidak bisa bersantai di pantai atau di sekitar kolam renang. Jika Anda, seperti saya, ingin bersantai di resor yang tenang dan nyaman, saya sangat merekomendasikan Merusaka."
"626.","Thomas Burt","9","2023-01-14","1","Tempat ini terlihat bagus dari resepsionis, tetapi begitu sampai di sana, kamarnya gelap dan suram. Banyak staf yang tersenyum dan menyapa, tetapi tidak menawarkan bantuan apa pun dan seolah-olah mengabaikan Anda. Rasanya aneh! Saya dan pasangan saya memesan 4 malam di sana dan pergi setelah 3 jam. Kami tidak merasa nyaman dan senang kami pergi! Jelas bukan hotel bintang 5!"
"627.","やっしー","113","2019-01-14","1","Saya ingin menginap di hotel bintang 5 di Nusa Dua, jadi saya memilih hotel dengan bathtub dan harga di bawah 20.000 yen per malam demi ketenangan pikiran. Namun, ekspektasi saya pupus. Hari ke-2: Koper saya, yang saya tinggalkan di kamar, tidak terkunci saat saya pergi. Hari ke-3: Saya mengganti kombinasi kunci koper, tetapi seseorang pasti telah mencoba membukanya saat saya pergi, karena kombinasi kuncinya telah diganti. Saya memiliki sekitar 50.000 yen uang tunai yang disembunyikan di dalam sekantong permen kenyal jus buah di dalam koper, tetapi untungnya tidak ada yang dicuri. Namun, ada risiko narkoba telah ditanam di dalamnya dan saya akan dilaporkan ke polisi dan dimintai suap, jadi saya akhirnya harus memeriksa koper dan semua barang bawaan di dalamnya secara menyeluruh. (Saya pernah mendengar seorang kenalan saya pernah mengalami pengalaman buruk ketika seseorang menemukan selembar kertas berisi narkoba terselip di dalam buku di dalam kopernya.) Saya juga menyimpan salinan kartu kredit saya di dalam koper untuk berjaga-jaga jika hilang, jadi sekarang saya perlu memeriksanya untuk memastikan kartu saya tidak digunakan secara curang di kemudian hari. Ketika saya melaporkan hal ini kepada manajer jaga, ia mengatakan akan menyelidikinya, dan saya mendengar hasil penyelidikannya keesokan harinya. Ia bersikeras, Kami telah mengidentifikasi petugas kebersihannya, dan ia mengatakan tidak pernah mencoba membuka koper itu. Ketika saya bertanya, Tidak ada yang akan jujur ​​tentang percobaan pencurian, kan? ia menjawab, Ada kamera pengawas di area umum seperti lorong, dan petugas kebersihannya terlatih dengan baik. Kepala bagian kebersihan memeriksa semua barang bawaan sebelum dan sesudah membersihkan, jadi mustahil bagi mereka untuk mencuri barang bawaan dari kamar tamu. Saya pernah membaca ulasan berbahasa Inggris tentang pencurian perhiasan, jadi saya bertanya, Kalau barangnya kecil seperti uang tunai atau perhiasan, bukankah mungkin mereka menyembunyikannya di pot bunga atau semacamnya saat dibersihkan lalu membawanya pulang? Dia menjawab, Bagaimanapun, kami mohon Anda percaya pada kami. Apakah Anda punya bukti bahwa kopernya sudah dibuka? Saya juga marah dan bertanya, Apakah tamu bertanggung jawab menyimpan bukti bagasi di hotel bintang 5? Saya akan membatalkan sisa masa inap saya dan menginap di hotel lain, jadi saya ingin pengembalian dana. Namun, mereka menolak, mengatakan mereka tidak bisa memberi saya pengembalian dana, jadi saya memutuskan itu buang-buang waktu dan menyerah. Sebagai catatan tambahan, staf di meja depan, concierge, restoran, dll. semuanya ramah, sangat sopan, dan sangat membantu. Namun, tidak ada yang bisa berbahasa Jepang. Semua staf fasih berbahasa Inggris, dan beberapa bisa berbahasa Mandarin. Kolam renangnya juga cukup luas dan menyenangkan. Berikut beberapa hal yang mengganggu saya sebagai hotel bintang 5 dibandingkan dengan hotel bintang 5 ternama di luar negeri: Pantainya tampak agak terlalu kumuh untuk standar Jepang, tetapi saya rasa itu tidak dapat dihindari mengingat ombak yang tinggi dan sampah yang berserakan di sekitar area tersebut. Ada petugas kebersihan, tetapi sepertinya solusi mendasar tidak akan mungkin dilakukan tanpa menggunakan mesin seperti pembersih pantai yang ditarik traktor. Untuk kamar, pintunya terbuat dari sepotong kayu, jadi tidak terlalu kedap udara dan Anda dapat mendengar suara bising dari luar. Kamar saya dekat dengan lift, tetapi saya dapat mendengar bel pintu lift saat saya tidur. Tentu saja, percakapan di lorong mudah terdengar. Saya bisa tidur nyenyak bahkan di tengah kebisingan, jadi itu tidak mengganggu saya, tetapi jika kebisingan mengganggu Anda, saya sarankan untuk menghindarinya. TV di kamar terkadang tidak menyala, jadi saya melepas kunci kartu kamar, mematikan pemutus arus, dan menunggu beberapa saat hingga berfungsi kembali. Ini juga poin kecil, tapi kulkas di kamar kurang dingin. Mungkin ini karena kinerja kulkasnya, karena ditempatkan di wadah kayu, panas terperangkap di dalamnya, dan letak kulkasnya perlu diperbaiki. Soal makanan, saya rasa makanannya bisa lebih enak di luar, baik dari segi rasa maupun harga. Secara keseluruhan, meskipun hotel ini tampak seperti milik orang Indonesia, rasanya agak kurang dibandingkan hotel bintang 5 asing yang terkenal, atau mungkin kurang mewah. Saya merasakan perbedaannya pada detail-detail kecilnya. Kalau bukan karena masalah koper, saya pasti akan memberi 4 bintang."

Seprai kotor dan tua. AC kamar bocor, dan juga penuh serangga & semut. Kulkas mini tidak berfungsi dengan baik. Sarapan prasmanannya kurang internasional dan pilihannya kurang cocok untuk wisatawan Arab. Spa bisa menjadi pengalaman terburuk yang pernah saya alami, lampunya tidak dimatikan, dan minyak yang digunakan berbau tidak sedap. Perabotan kamarnya tua.

"632.","wed khalid","24","2025-01-14","1","Saya tidak tahu untuk apa semua ulasan ini. Dari luar, hotel ini biasa saja; kamarnya memiliki dua tempat tidur yang disatukan, AC-nya bocor dan mengeluarkan suara-suara yang mengganggu, ketelnya kotor dan saya menemukan serangga di dalamnya. Kamar mandinya bau dan bak mandinya menjijikkan. Alasan manajernya tidak masuk akal, seolah-olah dia sedang berbicara dengan anak kecil sungguhan. Dia tidak menghargai pikiran kami. Singkatnya, saya sudah membayar dan dia akan memberi tahu Anda. Sungguh mustahil bagi saya untuk kembali lagi. Hotelnya mahal untuk apa-apa, bahkan sarapannya pun tidak cocok untuk saya, sayangnya."
"633.","Екатерина Ткаченко","25","2024-01-14","1","Hotelnya buruk, pelayanannya buruk. Kamarnya tua. Apa lagi yang bisa saya katakan tentang restorannya, makanannya menjijikkan. Tidak ada sarapan, tidak ada makan siang, tidak ada makan malam - tidak ada yang bisa dipilih atau dipesan. Kami ingin membatalkan reservasi selama seminggu - mereka tidak mengembalikan uang sama sekali. Ini adalah pengalaman terburuk dalam sejarah hotel seumur hidup saya."
"634.","K. E.","8","2020-01-14","1","Sangat mengecewakan. Untuk bulan madu kami, kami ingin memanjakan diri dengan menginap di resor mewah bintang 5 selama beberapa hari terakhir perjalanan kami di Bali sebelum pulang. Sayangnya, rencana itu gagal total dan menjadi pengalaman terburuk yang kami alami selama tiga minggu di Bali. Empat malam di Inaya membuat kami merasa rindu rumah, perasaan yang belum pernah kami alami sebelumnya selama liburan, dan terutama seharusnya tidak kami rasakan selama bulan madu kami. Satu-satunya hal yang bisa diterima adalah lokasinya yang tepat di pantai (kecuali di hari terakhir) & kunjungan ke restoran untuk makan malam. Hanya di sanalah pelayanan dan makanannya benar-benar baik (meskipun harganya sangat mahal dibandingkan dengan tempat lain di Bali, setidaknya makanannya jauh lebih enak daripada di Bali Collection). Terutama hal-hal berikut ini yang sangat mengecewakan: - Wifi: kualitasnya buruk setelah terhubung - Sarapan: Pertama, Anda harus mendaftar untuk sarapan, lalu dipersilakan duduk oleh staf. Jika Anda beruntung, prosedur ini hanya memakan waktu 15 menit. Tidak ada pilihan tempat duduk gratis, meja-meja lapang bagus di depan khusus disediakan untuk tamu, kami tidak tahu siapa. Ketika kami bertanya apakah kami boleh duduk di salah satu meja kosong, jawabannya adalah tidak, sudah ada yang duduk di sini, padahal selama kami sarapan, tidak ada yang datang ke meja ini. Suasana di ruang sarapan mengingatkan kita pada stasiun kereta yang penuh sesak, sangat berisik, dan penuh orang. Ketika akhirnya kita duduk di meja dan cukup beruntung untuk langsung memesan kopi, teh, atau jus, akan butuh waktu lama sampai kita mendapatkan minuman dan semoga pesanan kita lengkap. Jika ingin kopi atau jus lagi, kita harus mencari pelayan untuk memesan, terkadang butuh lebih dari 30 menit atau kita harus melambaikan tangan selama beberapa menit agar pelayan menyadari keberadaan kita. Sementara itu, piring kotor kita bisa setinggi menara Pisa karena tidak ada yang merasa bertanggung jawab untuk membersihkan meja. Pelayanannya tampaknya tidak mampu menangani tamu. Pemandangan seperti ini terjadi setiap hari, bukan seperti yang kita harapkan dari resor bintang 5. Pengalaman sehari-hari ini merusak awal hari kami, untungnya kami menyewa skuter untuk melarikan diri. Pilihan sarapan Asia sangat banyak, meskipun kesibukan yang tak tertahankan, ini bagus. Pilihan keju atau sosis iris agak memalukan untuk kategori *ini, pojok keju hanya menawarkan dua jenis keju cheddar, tetapi suatu hari kami menemukan *satu* potong camembert. Layanannya sangat lama untuk mengembalikan piring prasmanan yang kosong, setiap hari kami harus menunggu buah, sayuran, dll. yang baru dipotong atau meminta isi ulang secara khusus. Musik tekno latar belakang tidak benar-benar meredakan suasana yang menegangkan (kami berusia 30-an & masih merasa kesal - apakah begitu sulit menemukan musik lounge yang keren?) begitu pula dengan suara bising tamu-tamu Tiongkok yang sedang menonton film. - area kolam renang & pantai: propertinya luas dan bagus, tetapi tidak ada cukup kursi santai di sekitar area kolam renang, jadi kami berjuang setiap hari untuk menemukan tempat di bawah bayangan. Pada hari terakhir kami ada persiapan untuk pernikahan (ke-2 selama kami menginap) sementara persiapan pernikahan pertama tidak mengganggu kami, untuk pernikahan kedua, inaya menutup setengah pantai & seluruh taman. jika perjuangan belum cukup sulit untuk menemukan tempat, hari ini layanan juga memesan lebih dari setengah kursi pantai untuk tamu harian, jadi tamu hotel tidak dapat menggunakannya.. sejak kapan staf hotel memesan kursi?? Sangat mengganggu juga adalah tes super berisik dari band pernikahan selama berjam-jam di siang hari. Kami hanya mendapat catatan yang meminta maaf atas ketidaknyamanan, manajemen seharusnya mengundang semua tamu hotel untuk makan malam untuk siksaan ini! kami merasa seperti tamu kelas 2 di resor bintang 5 saat bulan madu kami, apa yang salah dengan manajemen? Layanan terlalu sibuk dengan persiapan, mereka tidak peduli untuk mengurus tamu hotel mereka sendiri seperti menerima pesanan minuman atau makanan. Meskipun baunya sepanjang hari tidak dapat diterima seperti bensin, sulit untuk menghirup udara segar. Untungnya bagi Inaya simbol-simbolnya terbatas. Kami tidak akan pernah kembali ke Inaya. Untungnya kami juga merasakan keramahtamahan masyarakat Bali yang sangat baik. Inaya tidak termasuk di antaranya."

Makan malam itu gratis untuk tipe kamar yang kami tempati, dan kami menambahkan dan membayar untuk 7 orang ke paket gratis 10 orang. Kami meminta meja untuk grup dan telah dikonfirmasi oleh petugas di reservasi restoran, dan diminta untuk datang pukul 8 malam, yang awalnya kami minta pukul 7 malam melalui formulir reservasi Google mereka. Ketika kami datang, tidak ada meja yang disiapkan untuk grup kami. Akhirnya kami harus duduk terpisah. Makanannya tidak berkualitas baik. Dan pelayan terus bertanya apakah kami sudah membayar untuk orang tambahan. Tahun baru terburuk yang pernah ada."

Seprai dan handuknya mengecewakan; usang dan tidak dicuci dengan baik. Lebih baik bawa saja dari rumah. Di hotel bintang 5, antrean untuk sarapan sudah ada sejak pertama kali saya melihatnya, tapi antreannya panjang sekali. Kualitas makanannya biasa saja dan harganya buruk. Satu-satunya hal yang bagus adalah kamarnya memiliki akses ke kolam renang, tapi tentu saja harus bayar. Resor ini memang all-inclusive, tapi harus bayar. Pilihan yang buruk. Lebih dari sekadar pengalaman menginap di hotel bintang 5, saya harus komplain pukul 15.00 agar kamar dibersihkan. Tiga hari kemudian, seprai belum diganti. Antrean untuk sarapan masih berlanjut. Saya tidak mengerti bagaimana mereka bisa mendapatkan ulasan positif seperti itu dan hasil pengecatannya 4,6. Anda harus teliti dan berpengetahuan."

Kemudian bulan feb 2023 ini reservasi 5 kamar untuk keluarga dan 2 bule dengan masa tinggal sekitar 6 hari. Awalnya tidak ada masalah. Pada tanggal 18 feb 2023 pagi ketika kita kami sekeluarga hendak keluar lobi dengan membawa payung yang disediakan dalam kamar (pagi itu sedang hujan dari dini hari), ketika menuju mobil jemputan (kita ber 6 dewasa, 1 anak-anak dan bayi tanpa bule) dihentikan dan dihadang oleh petugas lobi (berseragam hijau pupus, tidak memperhatikan tag namanya) agar tidak membawa payung keluar. Kemudian saya bertanya mengapa tidak boleh? lagian kan sedang hujan? lalu dijawab dengan ketus jika penggunaan payung hanya boleh di area hotel dan jumlahnya terbatas. Sungguh terkejut dengan jawaban itu, karena setahu saya payung boleh dibawa kemanapun dan juga tidak ada tanda larangan membawanya keluar area hotel di tempat meletakan payung yang tersedia banyak dibeberapa titik area hotel. Pada saat check in pun tidak ada info peringatan itu. Sedangkan hari-hari sebelumnya, ketika kita berpergian dengan bule dan membawa payung keluar juga tidak ada masalah. Sangat disayangkan dan tidak masuk diakal jika hotel bintang 5 yang berada di lingkungan elit punya masalah keterbatasan jumlah payung. Sedangkan banyak bule terlihat membawa payung dari merusaka sampai ke area bali collection, juga tidak ada larangan. Giliran kita yang tamu lokal, petugas lobi beraninya langsung ngegas. Sama-sama tahu tapi beraninya cuma sama tamu lokal. Service merusaka memang sudah terkenal manis sama bule saja.

HALOOOO, berarti sebelumnya hanya alasan saja ya? yang saya rasakan lagi, sangat membedakan service antara turis lokal dan turis asing.. saya malam2 gendong bayi karena ketiduran, tidak ada 1 pun staff yang menawarkan buggy service untuk ke area kamar.. SANGAT KECEWA MEREKOMENDASIKAN HOTEL INI KE KELUARGA, DAN TIDAK AKAN KEMBALI LAGI KESINI.. PADAHAL SAAT STAY PERTAMA KALI KAMI SANGAT PUAS DAN HAPPY STAY DISINI..

"737.","Stephen","21","2025-11-20","1","Terlalu Mahal, Ketinggalan Zaman, dan Sangat Mengecewakan: Peringatan bagi Para Pencari Kemewahan ​Sejak kami tiba, resor ini langsung menunjukkan diri sebagai tempat yang ketinggalan zaman dan sangat membutuhkan perhatian. Apa yang disajikan sebagai tempat pelarian romantis yang eksklusif terasa langsung dikorbankan. Proses check-in di ruang terbuka menjadi pertanda kekecewaan layanan dan fasilitas yang menyusul. ​Meskipun memesan salah satu vila premium properti ini (dengan harga lebih dari $8,8 juta IDR per malam), perlakuan yang kami terima tidak berbeda dengan kamar standar. Kami tiba hanya satu jam sebelum waktu check-in resmi dan ditolak mentah-mentah untuk mendapatkan manfaat all-inclusive kami. Hal ini membingungkan dan tidak dapat diterima, terutama mengingat tarifnya dan fakta bahwa kami berangkat lebih awal (berangkat pukul 8 pagi) dan memiliki akses untuk check-out terlambat pukul 3 sore. Kurangnya itikad baik untuk tamu yang membayar mahal menciptakan preseden buruk. Vila: Mungil, Lelah, dan Benar-benar Disalahartikan Vila mewah itu sendiri sangat mengecewakan. Vila itu tampak lesu, dan jelas membutuhkan renovasi. Untuk sebuah resor dengan harga semahal ini, ketiadaan area duduk dalam ruangan ber-AC sungguh sebuah kegagalan. Kamar mandi yang hanya bernuansa terbuka merupakan tanda lain dari usia dan buruknya perawatan kamar. Fasilitasnya pun sama mengecewakannya: kulkasnya panas, dan janji all-inclusive hanya mencakup empat minuman per hari di kamar tanpa layanan kamar sama sekali. Penipuan All-Inclusive Namun, pelanggaran paling serius terletak pada paket all-inclusive. Kami biasanya menginap di Melia—yang, dengan harga yang sama, berada di dunia kemewahan yang berbeda—dan resor ini bahkan tidak sebanding. Setibanya di sana, kami diberitahu oleh resepsionis bahwa paket all-inclusive hanya mencakup minuman beralkohol dan minuman lokal. Kami segera menyadari bahwa paket ini bahkan tidak termasuk Bintang, bir lokal pilihan kami, yang merupakan biaya tambahan. Bayangkan betapa tidak percayanya berada di Bali, dengan paket lengkap, dan harus membayar ekstra untuk Bintang! ​Bagi siapa pun yang mencari liburan mewah yang benar-benar romantis di Bali, saya sampaikan saran yang tulus: hindari resor ini. Resor ini benar-benar terlalu digemari, sangat mengecewakan, dan merupakan pemborosan uang di lokasi yang begitu menakjubkan."
"738.","Артур Сиразов","5","2025-11-20","1","Saat ini kami menginap di hotel ini. Hotelnya sangat tua, dan kamarnya buruk sekali – pancurannya tidak berfungsi, seprai bernoda, gordennya juga bernoda, dan peredam suaranya buruk sekali, seolah-olah ada yang melakukan sesuatu di kamar kami. Kamar mandinya dalam kondisi buruk, berjamur di sekelilingnya. Ada stopkontak di satu sisi tempat tidur, tetapi tidak di sisi lainnya. Hal-hal yang tampaknya sederhana ini memang praktis, tetapi tidak dipikirkan atau diperbaiki dengan matang. Kami datang untuk sarapan; ada banyak pilihan, tetapi semuanya sangat kotor sehingga merusak selera makan. Di tempat sushi gulung, ada kecap asin, tetapi saya tidak menemukan piring untuk menuangkannya. Saya rasa Anda harus menuangkannya langsung ke sushi gulung... Di tempat Anda mengambil air dan jus, ada gelas di bawahnya, tetapi semuanya kotor. Rasanya seperti kain lap yang digunakan untuk mengelap piring tidak diganti. Gelas-gelasnya tertutup serat dan semacam noda, dan piring-piringnya juga kurang memuaskan. Lalu seorang gadis menghampiri kami dan memperingatkan bahwa sarapan akan selesai dalam 20 menit dan mungkin kami ingin memesan minuman. Kami memesan jus segar, menunggu 20 menit, dan minuman itu masih belum datang. Dan ini baru hari pertama kami di sini; saya yakin akan ada lebih banyak keluhan. Ketidakpedulian pemilik dan staf hotel telah menyebabkan keadaan ini. Saya terkejut dengan ulasan positif untuk hotel ini, padahal banyak sekali kekurangannya."
"739.","Maya Ik","12","2025-09-20","1","Kami menghabiskan sehari di tempat Anda dengan Day Pass dan sangat kecewa. Lingkungannya jauh dari harapan. Pantainya penuh plastik dan sampah, begitu pula tepi lautnya. Sayang sekali melihat kurangnya perawatan, terutama di tempat yang katanya surga. Pengalaman kami dirusak oleh kotoran, dan meninggalkan kenangan yang sangat buruk. Sangat penting untuk meningkatkan kebersihan demi menciptakan suasana yang menyenangkan dan menghargai pelanggan serta lingkungan."
"740.","jemma carney","11","2025-08-20","1","Meskipun merupakan hotel termahal dari tiga hotel yang kami tempati selama perjalanan kami ke Bali, resor besar ini adalah yang paling tidak kami sukai. Perjuangan sehari-hari untuk mendapatkan kursi santai di tepi kolam renang sangat menjengkelkan, karena para tamu akan memesannya dengan handuk sejak pagi hari, dan masalah ini tidak ditangani oleh staf. Masalah ini terus berlanjut sepanjang hari. Meskipun pantai tampak menarik pada pandangan pertama, laut dipenuhi dengan sampah. Pada hari pertama kami, putri teman kami sayangnya menginjak kondom saat berjalan di pasir. Kejadian ini membuat kami enggan mengunjungi pantai selama sisa masa tinggal kami. Selain itu, kami merasa bahwa jumlah staf tidak mencukupi untuk melayani para tamu dengan baik. Piring makan siang dan gelas minuman tidak dikumpulkan secara teratur, dan handuk kolam renang habis pada dua dari lima hari kami berada di sana sebelum diisi ulang. Resor ini memiliki empat restoran, tetapi pilihan menunya rata-rata dan cukup mirip. Meskipun menggunakan paket all-inclusive, beberapa hidangan dikenakan biaya tambahan. Mengingat lokasi hotel, kami mengharapkan lebih banyak pilihan hiburan untuk para tamu selain beberapa penyanyi yang tampil saat makan malam. Setelah lima malam, kami tidak hanya bosan tetapi juga jenuh dengan makanannya. Pada malam terakhir kami, tiga hidangan penutup di menu restoran di bawah lobi utama tidak tersedia. Kamar kami menyenangkan, tetapi hanya memiliki satu gantungan handuk, dan pilihan di minibar yang termasuk dalam paket cukup biasa. Tidak ada juga laci di kamar, yang menurut kami merupakan kekurangan desain. Sofa juga tidak nyaman. Kami membayar ekstra untuk kamar dengan akses langsung ke kolam renang, tetapi kami hanya menggunakannya sekali dan merasa itu tidak sepadan dengan biaya tambahannya. Di sisi positifnya, stafnya ramah."

Saya meminta petugas di gerbang untuk menghubungi lobi agar seseorang dapat membukakan pintu ketika saya berada di kamar saya, tetapi tidak ada yang datang. Kemudian saya menghubungi lobi menggunakan nomor telepon di Google, namun tetap tidak ada yang datang, saya menelepon lagi, tetap tidak ada yang datang. Saya sedang berjalan ke lobi ketika seorang staf hotel dengan buggy mengatakan dia datang untuk menjemput saya, ketika saya sampai di lobi, istri saya menelepon saya untuk mengatakan bahwa seseorang datang untuk membukakan pintu, begitu banyak kebingungan untuk hal yang sepele.

Saya yakin sekali bagaimana saya meninggalkannya. Pengalaman ini membuat saya mempertanyakan seberapa baik staf dilatih dalam menangani barang-barang milik tamu.

Saat menikmati pesta kolam renang, dia mengeluh ada sengatan di wajahnya. Kami membawanya keluar dan setelah mandi, kami melihat wajah anak laki-laki saya memerah, ruam gatal di pipinya di bawah dan atas matanya juga. . Dia menangis dan sangat tidak nyaman, dan sebagai orang tua, sungguh memilukan melihat anak Anda kesakitan karena sesuatu yang seharusnya aman. Ketika saya mengeluh, mereka mengatakan kepada saya itu tidak pernah terjadi sebelumnya tetapi cukup yakin itu mungkin diencerkan secara salah. Tidak senang harus membatalkan semua rencana yang kami buat."

"749.","Lusy Paulina","4","2025-08-20","1","Merusaka Nusa Dua adalah tempat peristirahatan yang luar biasa. Sejak kedatangan saya, saya merasa benar-benar disambut—stafnya penuh perhatian, hangat, dan selalu berusaha keras untuk membuat setiap tamu merasa istimewa. Sentuhan pribadi dan tulus mereka sungguh tak terlupakan. Lokasi tepi pantainya sungguh menakjubkan, hanya beberapa langkah dari pantai, terasa seperti surga. Kamar-kamarnya luas dan dirancang dengan elegan. Bersantap di sini adalah pengalaman yang sesungguhnya. Makanannya disiapkan dengan cermat, memadukan cita rasa lokal dan hidangan Indonesia. Resor ini bukan sekadar tempat menginap—melainkan pelarian ke dunia ketenangan dan kenyamanan yang menjadikannya destinasi tak terlupakan. Saya pulang dengan perasaan segar dan terinspirasi."
"750.","Sarah Ayati","5","2025-04-20","1","Sayangnya, pengalaman menginap kami di Merusaka Nusa Dua sangat mengecewakan. Staf pantainya tidak ramah dan tidak membantu, dan sarapannya lebih seperti kafetaria yang bising daripada hotel bintang 5. Suasananya sama sekali tidak menenangkan – banyak tamu yang berisik, tidak sopan, dan beberapa mabuk. Setelah mengeluh, kami hanya ditawari upgrade kamar, yang tidak menyelesaikan masalah sebenarnya. Kami ingin meninggalkan hotel lebih awal, tetapi malah dirujuk ke Booking.com. Kami tidak merekomendasikannya – sayangnya harga dan kenyataan di sini sangat tidak sesuai. Pantainya kotor; tidak ada hubungannya dengan Bali. Kami akan tetap check out…sangat tidak memuaskan."
"751.","Guilherme Paschoal","45","2025-05-20","1","Saya berharap bisa memberikan ulasan yang lebih baik, tetapi pengalaman menginapnya biasa saja. Nusa Dua memang tempat menginap yang nyaman, tetapi hotel ini jauh dari bintang 5. Anda bisa menemukan ulasan lain tentang infrastruktur hotel dan kamarnya. Yang ingin saya sampaikan di sini adalah keterlambatan pengembalian deposit yang mereka minta. Ya, mereka meminta deposit sebesar 2.000.000 rupiah, yang setara dengan sekitar 115 euro, dan yah... saya tidak tahu kapan uang saya akan kembali. Saya sudah mengirim pesan ke layanan tamu mereka dan memang dibalas dengan cepat, katanya bank mereka lama sekali membalas. Mereka sudah mengirim email ke bank, tapi siapa tahu? Saya bukan orang pertama yang membayar deposit ini dengan kartu kredit, jadi apa masalahnya? Sudah 10 hari kerja berlalu dan belum ada pengembalian uang. Mungkin saya akan kembali beberapa hari lagi untuk mengatakan bahwa uang saya dicuri."
"752.","Jonathan Ding","1","2025-07-20","1","Pengalaman hari ini sangat buruk. Infrastruktur hotel bagus tetapi layanannya buruk.

Saya mencoba menelepon manajer jaga dua kali setelahnya tetapi dia tidak pernah mengangkat telepon. Sekarang sudah pukul 22.00 siang dan saya dan istri masih menunggu air panas"
"753.","Ivascu Vesna","5","2025-01-20","1","Saya memesan kamar melalui agen perjalanan di Bali, dan karena saya tidak melakukan reservasi langsung di Booking.com, saya meninggalkan ulasan saya di sini untuk membantu wisatawan lain dalam membuat keputusan yang tepat. Pertama dan terpenting, saya ingin memastikan calon tamu tidak tertipu oleh agen perjalanan di Bali atau Rumania untuk memilih hotel ini, karena hal itu dapat merusak pengalaman liburan mereka. Harganya sangat tinggi; sepertinya agen perjalanan mengamankan reservasi dengan harga yang sangat rendah lalu membebankan biaya tersebut kepada wisatawan. Selain itu, saya tidak habis pikir mengapa mereka merekomendasikan tempat yang mengenakan tarif yang sama dengan hotel-hotel internasional ternama di mana Anda benar-benar dapat menemukan layanan bintang lima. Hotel ini bahkan hampir tidak memenuhi syarat sebagai hotel bintang tiga. Saya memesan empat malam termasuk sarapan, tetapi saya tidak bisa tidur semalam pun. Ketika saya meminta pengembalian dana, manajer hotel dengan tegas menolak untuk mengembalikan uang saya. Kamar-kamarnya dalam kondisi yang sangat buruk—perabotannya tua, kasurnya usang, dan seprai bernoda seperti ada kutu busuk. Pendingin ruangannya berisik dan tidak memadai untuk standar hotel bintang lima, padahal sistem ventilasi internal yang tenang seharusnya memungkinkan tidur malam yang nyenyak. Stafnya tampak kurang terawat, dengan seragam yang kotor. Area kolam renang tidak terawat, dan terdapat sampah di jalan setapak dan pantai. Kondisi perawatan secara keseluruhan terlihat jelas dari lobi hotel, di mana jok kursi yang compang-camping dan kotoran di lantai langsung menarik perhatian. Saya perhatikan hotel ini memiliki peringkat tinggi di Booking.com; namun, saya menduga ulasan yang kurang baik mungkin telah dihapus. Bagi Anda yang berasal dari Rumania dan membaca ini, saya harus mengatakan bahwa menginap di sini terasa seperti menginap di Eforie. Saya harap pengalaman saya dapat menyelamatkan orang lain dari pengalaman menginap yang mengecewakan."
"754.","Danielius Radvilavičius","42","2025-04-20","1","Pengalaman terburuk di Bali dari 2 kali saya menginap di sini. Saya meminta kamar dengan tempat tidur king sebanyak 4 kali, dan 4 kali lagi dijamin semuanya akan dilakukan agar saya bisa mendapatkannya. Saat check-in, mereka dengan menyesal memberi tahu saya bahwa kamar dengan pemandangan taman tidak tersedia dengan tempat tidur king, dan kami mendapatkan kamar dengan dua tempat tidur - sofanya bernoda, tidak ada tempat pengisian daya ponsel, kekurangan perlengkapan dasar lainnya, dan hanya berkarat dan kuno. Setelah mengeluh, dalam 1 jam, secara ajaib kamar dengan tempat tidur king muncul dan kami ditawari untuk pindah ke sana. Sistem ventilasinya sangat berisik bahkan dengan pengaturan rendah, sehingga mustahil untuk tidur. Harga tempat ini terlalu mahal untuk apa yang ditawarkannya."
"755.","Sunshine K","12","2025-05-20","1","Ini hotel yang sangat besar. Sangat perlu direnovasi dan perlu banyak peningkatan. Semuanya kurang memuaskan. Ini jelas bukan resor bintang 5.

HIG, sebagai merek perhotelan, memiliki staf yang paling tidak ramah, sama sekali tidak sopan. Saya tidak akan merekomendasikan tempat ini kepada siapa pun di masa mendatang."
"757.","Tejash Shah","4","2025-04-20","1","Proses pemesanannya sungguh mimpi buruk, dengan banyak kesalahan reservasi yang tak seorang pun repot-repot memperbaikinya. Layanan penyambutan tamu tidak ada, dan saya dibiarkan berdiri di resepsionis terlalu lama sebelum akhirnya diizinkan check-in. Lebih parah lagi, tidak ada kipas angin atau AC di resepsionis, membuat saya harus menunggu lama sekali. Jelas bukan seperti yang Anda harapkan dari hotel bintang 5. Saya tidak akan merekomendasikan hotel bintang 5 ini. Hotel bintang 5 ini lebih buruk daripada hotel non-bintang."
"758.","Wei Long Tan","36","2025-01-20","1","Hotel ini benar-benar mengecewakan. Kamarnya sangat ketinggalan zaman, dan unit AC-nya sama sekali tidak memadai. Tidak hanya tidak memberikan pendinginan yang memadai, tetapi juga mengalami kebocoran selama saya menginap. Lebih parah lagi, istri saya diserang kutu busuk dengan ganas, meninggalkan noda darah di seluruh seprai. Tanggapan hotel sama sekali tidak memadai. Mereka hanya menawarkan untuk mengganti seprai, menunjukkan ketidakpedulian terhadap situasi yang ada. Baru setelah tekanan yang signifikan, mereka setuju untuk memindahkan kami ke kamar lain. Tidak ada kompensasi lain yang ditawarkan, dan sikap manajer jaga Gusti sangat buruk, bersikeras bahwa ini hanyalah serangga/nyamuk Bali biasa, sebuah klaim yang menghina dan tidak akurat, terutama mengingat bukti foto. Pengalaman sarapannya sama buruknya. Antrean panjang untuk mendapatkan tempat duduk setiap pagi dan para tamu terpaksa berada di bawah terik matahari atau hujan, karena staf dengan tidak berperasaan menolak untuk membiarkan mereka menunggu di tempat teduh. Sangat buruk sehingga saya harus check out satu malam lebih awal (dan mereka menolak untuk mengembalikan uang), dan saya sungguh-sungguh menyarankan semua calon wisatawan untuk menjauhi tempat yang tidak berstandar ini."
"759.","Suman Jain","7","2025-07-20","1","Restoran ini tidak disarankan untuk orang India yang vegetarian. Sangat kecewa dengan makanannya. Saat sarapan, hanya ada Aalu Baji dan Pakoda untuk vegetarian di restoran Asia ini. Semua menu lainnya mengandung telur atau bukan vegetarian. Atas permintaan, mereka membuat Aalu Paratha yang hambar dan benar-benar mentah. Sama sekali tidak direkomendasikan untuk vegetarian. Sangat tidak disarankan untuk orang India jika Anda lebih menyukai makanan vegetarian murni."
"760.","erita peng","12","2025-04-20","1","Saya baru menyadarinya setelah check-in. Setelah check-in dan hendak mandi, saya sangat terkejut ketika shower yang sudah saya siapkan diganti. Untuk sesaat, saya tidak percaya. Filter putihnya berubah dalam 5 detik menjadi sesuatu yang tampak seperti belum diganti selama setahun. Saya terkejut lagi sebelum tidur... Saya bisa mengerti serangga lain, karena mereka tropis. Tapi saya ragu kecoak. Sarapan...jujur ​​saja, tidak ada yang bisa dimakan. Benar-benar tidak ada. (Ini mengingatkan saya pada hotel bintang 4 di Taiwan.) Singkatnya, ini hanyalah hotel dengan harga terjangkau di Bali."
"761.","Nidya Yu","136","2025-02-20","1","Pelayanannya buruk. Ada banyak kamar dan fasilitas, dan areanya sangat luas, tetapi jelas tidak ada cukup staf. Saat check-in, mereka sama sekali tidak memperkenalkan fasilitas, aktivitas, lokasi sarapan, atau waktu sarapan; mereka hanya memindai paspor kami dan memanggil orang berikutnya. Sarapannya sangat lama, setiap kelompok harus menunggu sepuluh menit hingga nomor mereka dipanggil. Meja-meja tidak dibersihkan tepat waktu, dan kami dipaksa makan di bawah terik matahari, hampir kena sengatan panas. Ada juga banyak lalat. Fasilitas kamar sudah tua, AC-nya bocor, hanya tempat tidurnya yang lumayan, dan kedap suaranya buruk. Secara keseluruhan, pengalaman yang sangat buruk."
"762.","Neil O'Shaughnessy","4","2025-01-20","1","Hotel terburuk yang pernah saya kunjungi di Bali. Pelayanannya sangat buruk. Petugas yang menjaga handuk kolam renang yang sudah tua, bernoda, dan robek memberi tahu kami bahwa kolam renang tutup pukul 19.00 karena jelas-jelas dia tidak ingin melakukan pekerjaan lagi. Staf kolam renang harus mengambilkan handuk untuk kami karena kolam renang buka hingga larut malam. Staf kolam renang hanya berdiri berkelompok. Botol, gelas, dan piring makanan kami menumpuk berjam-jam di meja, membuat lalat beterbangan di area tersebut. Kamar mandi di kamar tidak bersih dan ada pasir di sana pada hari pertama. Fasilitasnya kuno dan usang, bantal kursi santai pantai robek. Paket lengkapnya tidak sepadan. Pizza terburuk yang pernah saya makan. Restoran Indonesia memang menyajikan makanan yang enak. Memiliki 4 pijat termasuk, tetapi tempat itu sudah dipesan untuk perjalanan kami. Meskipun saya sudah mengirim pesan sebelumnya dan bertanya apakah saya perlu memesan restoran/spa terlebih dahulu, mereka bilang tidak. Buang-buang uang, tidak menikmatinya! Tidak menenangkan."
"763.","Jakob Greenfeld","91","2025-01-20","1","Entah kenapa resor ini punya banyak ulasan bagus. Jauh dari standar bintang 5. Toilet di kolam renang kotor dan bau. Gelasnya kotor. Musik yang berbeda-beda terdengar dari dua sisi. Musiknya bermasalah dan berhenti setiap beberapa menit, menimbulkan suara-suara aneh yang keras. Stafnya tidak ramah. Pantainya penuh tanah. Sulit menemukan kursi berjemur kosong yang tidak terkena sinar matahari sepenuhnya. Seluruh tempat terlihat kumuh dan sangat membutuhkan renovasi."
"764.","Alok Sharma","10","2025-07-20","1","Hotelnya bagus, tetapi tidak cocok untuk orang India karena tidak ada makanan vegetarian yang tersedia di sini. Selain itu, permintaan saya tidak dipenuhi, padahal rata-rata 10% tamu adalah orang India. Untuk makanan non-vegetarian, Anda tidak akan merasakan apa pun seperti makanan India. Jika Anda memilih makanan India, mohon periksa terlebih dahulu sebelum datang. Saya di sini hari ini dan saya kecewa."
"765.","Jon Tarifa","7","2025-01-20","1","Kami sangat kecewa dengan pengalaman kami di resor ini. Kami sengaja memilih destinasi ini untuk melarikan diri dari hiruk pikuk Canggu, tetapi malah mendapati diri kami berada di lingkungan yang lebih bising. Selama menginap, ada pesta pernikahan yang sangat berisik, benar-benar menghancurkan kesempatan untuk bersantai. Sebagai keluarga beranggotakan empat orang, mustahil bagi kami untuk menikmati waktu kami—anak-anak kami gelisah dan tidak nyaman karena kebisingan yang terus-menerus dan memekakkan telinga di seluruh tempat. Lebih parah lagi, kami bahkan tidak bisa menikmati jalan-jalan santai di pantai tanpa merasa seperti mengganggu pesta pernikahan. Ketika kami menyampaikan kekhawatiran kami di kasir, baik resepsionis maupun manajer yang bertugas sama sekali tidak menunjukkan empati. Tidak ada permintaan maaf—hanya tanggapan acuh tak acuh bahwa gangguan semacam ini normal dan sesuatu yang harus kami terima. Terus terang, sikap seperti itu sangat menyebalkan. Di atas semua ini, staf restoran bahkan tidak bisa menyiapkan pesanan kami dengan benar, membuat kesalahan beberapa kali selama kunjungan singkat kami yang hanya dua malam. Ini jauh dari liburan santai yang kami harapkan, dan kami tidak akan kembali."

Kualitas makanan di prasmanan sangat buruk, dan makanan tidak pernah diisi ulang setelah selesai, dan setiap pagi saya harus mengulanginya 2-3 kali dengan staf yang berbeda dan menunggu selama 30 menit sebelum diisi ulang. 3. Perawatan yang buruk. Beberapa area hotel kurang terawat, untuk ukuran hotel bintang 5."

"769.","Le Duy","4","2025-02-20","1","Ini salah satu layanan terburuk yang pernah saya dapatkan seumur hidup saya!!! Dan ya, saya sudah pernah menginap di 3 atau bahkan 2 hotel sebelumnya. Karyawannya sangat tidak profesional, saya sulit percaya mereka bekerja di bidang perhotelan: 1. Tidak dapat memenuhi jadwal check-in. Mereka hanya menyuruh saya duduk dan menunggu sampai dihubungi melalui WhatsApp. Tapi setelah 1 setengah jam, yang saya yakini cukup waktu untuk menyiapkan kamar, masih belum ada apa-apa. Waktu check-in sudah lewat setengah jam yang lalu, tapi satu-satunya jawaban yang saya dapatkan ketika saya bertanya adalah menunggu?!! Bukan begini seharusnya hotel bintang 5 memperlakukan pelanggan. SAYA TIDAK MENERIMA PERMINTAAN MAAF ATAU PENJELASAN apa pun untuk ini!!! 2. Ketika saya bertanya cara untuk bepergian ke luar (karena ini hotel besar dan mungkin lebih dari 1 km dari tempat menginap kami), resepsionis hanya memelototi saya dan berkata Anda bisa memesan taksi?! Seperti apakah itu diperbolehkan? Apakah begitu cara Anda memperlakukan pelanggan? Saya bertanya hanya karena melihat mobil listriknya, berharap mereka akan memberi saya penjelasan tentang cara menggunakan atau memesannya!! 3. Setelah saya mengkonfrontasi mereka tentang masa inap saya, mereka memberi saya kunci kamar dan menyuruh saya menunggu seseorang mengantar saya ke kamar dan yah, sudah 15 menit berlalu, siapa sangka, kan? 4. Dan alasan saya mengungkapkan semua ini di ulasan ini adalah karena kami bukan satu-satunya, ada orang lain yang harus menunggu di lobi seperti kami juga setelah SATU JAM melewati waktu check-in! Saya sangat berharap tidak akan pernah menemukan hotel seperti ini lagi, tidak hanya membuat saya kesal, tetapi juga membuat saya merasa seperti membuang-buang uang untuk layanan bintang 5."

Properti ini terlihat sangat berbeda dari aslinya..di foto terlihat sangat menarik dan bersih, tapi sebenarnya sangat kotor. Kami merasakan nyamuk di kamar begitu kami masuk, lobi berbau aneh, toilet di dekat resepsionis (rusak dan kertasnya bocor, baunya seperti toilet umum), bar, dan area pantai sangat buruk kebersihannya, tidak ada suasana sama sekali. Kami check-out 10 menit setelah check-in."

"773.","Rhiannon Weight","11","2025-01-20","1","Meskipun Merusaka tampak seperti Hotel yang indah, itu jauh dari pengalaman yang kami miliki. Hari ke 1 Suami sakit keracunan makanan, hari kedua saya sakit keracunan makanan. Ini membuat kami pingsan selama 3 malam kami menginap dan kami hampir tidak meninggalkan kamar. Harus memanggil dokter dua kali karena betapa sakitnya kami. Karena itu, 3 hari terakhir liburan kami dihabiskan di tempat tidur atau di toilet. Tambahkan ke Respons Hotel - sayang sekali Anda tidak bertanggung jawab dalam balasan Anda. Itu pasti makanan yang kami makan di hotel karena kami hanya makan dan minum dari hotel Anda. Ya, gejalanya bisa memakan waktu hingga 8 jam, tapi bisa juga muncul dalam beberapa jam. Meski sudah jam 8 masih makan di hotel. Dr cukup yakin itu juga dari makanan yang kami makan di sini."
"774.","Miriam El Hilaa","42","2025-01-20","1","Fasilitasnya indah, tetapi sisanya sama sekali bukan hotel bintang 5. Jauh dari itu. Kami adalah pasangan yang bepergian ke seluruh dunia. Kami juga tahu tentang fasilitas, dan kami tinggal di Alto Adige, Italia, di mana hotel-hotelnya berkelas tinggi. Kursi pantai selalu kotor. Sarapannya kurang berkualitas (padahal kami berada di hotel bintang 5). Tidak perlu komentar. Harganya seperti di Eropa, tetapi dengan kuantitas yang bahkan tidak sampai setengahnya."
"775.","Ana Carolina Moreira","42","2025-01-20","1","Sayangnya, pengalaman yang mengerikan. Saya tidak merekomendasikannya. Sama sekali tidak. Pelayanannya sangat tidak terorganisir. Hotel ini mungkin memiliki terlalu sedikit karyawan untuk jumlah tamu yang sangat banyak. Rasanya seperti berada di tempat yang berantakan. Ada keterlambatan pelayanan di restoran. Ada ketidakteraturan dalam alokasi kamar. Kami datang sebagai rombongan dan mereka tidak menempatkan kami di kamar yang benar. Salah satu pasangan, setelah berada di kamar, diminta untuk pergi dan pindah ke kamar lain. Saya datang dengan tunangan saya dan mereka menempatkan kami di kamar dengan dua tempat tidur single yang digabungkan. Mengerikan. Meskipun berada tepat di depan pantai, pantai ini sangat kotor dan ombaknya besar. Sungguh memalukan."
"776.","Nikola Lefterov","13","2025-01-20","1","Pantainya sangat kotor sehingga tidak cocok untuk aktivitas air apa pun. Kolam renangnya sangat panas dan tidak nyaman untuk ditinggali. Restoran: Meskipun kami memesan paket all-inclusive, ada banyak hal yang dikenakan biaya tambahan. Biaya tambahannya sekitar 5 hingga 10 euro, yang tidak masalah, tetapi kualitas makanannya sangat buruk dan kami mengalami banyak masalah perut. Tidak ada aktivitas malam hari jika Anda masih muda. Anda tidak bisa melakukan apa pun di sana setelah pukul 23:00. Semuanya tutup dan Anda bahkan tidak bisa minum. Secara umum, kebersihannya buruk, makanannya buruk, dan benar-benar membosankan. Ini adalah liburan terburuk saya sejauh ini. Saya bahkan mengakhirinya sebelum waktu yang direncanakan."
"777.","Sophia Lausch","7","2025-05-20","1","Perhatian! Kami tidak pernah menerima kembali deposit kami. Mereka bilang deposit akan otomatis dikreditkan ke kartu kredit kami dalam dua minggu.

"778.","Anna V","31","2025-01-20","1","Karena ini adalah hotel milik pemerintah, stafnya sama sekali tidak repot-repot membuat wisatawan nyaman. Kamar-kamarnya tua dan kotor. Mereka hanya membersihkan kamar jika Anda menelepon setidaknya dua kali dan bertanya. Tidak ada rasa bersih sama sekali di kamar. Karena hotel ini milik pemerintah, manajemen mengadakan acara dengan musik keras untuk beberapa delegasi hingga pukul 2 pagi. Ketika saya bertanya mengapa saya tidak bisa tidur nyenyak di kamar saya pada pukul 11 ​​malam di hari Jumat, manajer menjelaskan bahwa itu baru hari ini dan semuanya akan baik-baik saja besok... tetapi mereka ada acara hari ini dan mereka tidak akan melakukan apa pun untuk itu. Saya sangat tidak puas dengan layanan di hotel ini. Saya harus menginap selama dua hari karena kurangnya kamar yang tersedia di hotel tetangga. Semuanya sangat buruk. Saya tidak merekomendasikannya jika Anda mengharapkan masa inap yang tenang dan nyaman yang setara dengan hotel bintang 5. Saat ini, nilainya 3+ paling banyak, dan itu mengingat lokasinya yang strategis dan pantainya yang indah. Kamar-kamarnya sangat tua sehingga AC-nya bocor, dan kami harus menunggu beberapa jam hingga teknisi datang dan memperbaikinya. Lantai kamar kami tergenang air; ketika mereka datang untuk memperbaikinya, mereka membuka penutup AC dan air terjun menyembur keluar. Sayangnya, semua yang ada di hotel ini benar-benar suram. Tidak ada yang menawarkan untuk memindahkan saya ke kamar lain. Dan tidak ada permintaan maaf yang diberikan. Kedap suara di kamar sangat buruk. Pukul 7.30 pagi, orang-orang mulai berjalan di lorong, dan kebisingannya membangunkan saya. Entah kenapa, petugas kebersihan mulai mengetuk pintu kami saat itu, menawarkan untuk membersihkan kamar kami. Wajar saja, pukul 7.30 pagi terlalu awal untuk membersihkan, untuk sedikitnya. Tapi kemudian, untuk membersihkan ini, saya menelepon resepsionis dua atau tiga kali sepanjang hari, dan ketika nada bicara saya mulai menuntut, seseorang dari staf akhirnya datang dan membersihkan. Minibar tidak diisi. Singkatnya, hotel yang dikelola pemerintah dengan staf yang buruk..."

Kami ingin pergi sejenak untuk beristirahat, tetapi kami bahkan tidak bisa masuk ke pantai karena pernikahan sedang berlangsung. Setelah dilaporkan, mereka bahkan tidak meminta maaf dan manajer yang bertugas berkata beginilah cara kami berbisnis! Jadi, kami pergi dan dia menerima panggilan telepon lagi."

"781.","Monica Mignani","208","2023-01-20","1","Hotelnya biasa saja. Kami memesannya untuk bersantai, tapi sayangnya, itu tidak selalu memungkinkan di sini. Selama 6 hari kami di sini, mereka menyelenggarakan acara untuk perusahaan swasta (pesta perusahaan) di 4 hotel. Suasananya sangat bising siang dan malam, dan tamu lain harus bersabar. Buruk! Kamar-kamarnya tidak dilengkapi dengan baik. Kamar mandinya hanya memiliki satu gantungan untuk menggantung pakaian basah. Kamar tidurnya tidak memiliki laci dan hanya satu rak dengan ketinggian yang cukup mudah diakses. Saya menyimpan semua pakaian dalam dan baju renang saya di kamar mandi; tidak ada tempat untuk menyimpannya di kamar tidur. Kompleks ini secara keseluruhan sangat membutuhkan renovasi. Hampir semua tikar pantai di pantai rusak. Sangat tidak direkomendasikan! Sayang sekali, padahal seharusnya bisa lebih baik."
"782.","Z L","30","2023-01-20","1","Mereka membagikan kupon makanan (😹) dan jika Anda kehilangan kupon tersebut, Anda harus pergi ke resepsionis, menulis pernyataan, mendapatkan dokumen di A4, yang mengonfirmasi sistem makanan Anda ke restoran... Bapak-bapak manajer, ini abad ke-21, dan hotel ini masih seperti di pertengahan abad lalu. Restoran Gading di HF dan FB kurang memuaskan saat memesan a la carte. Burgernya, seperti yang disebutkan sebelumnya dalam ulasan, sebenarnya hanya akan disukai oleh anjing, tidak semua anjing. Kentangnya sudah tua, basi, dan berbintik-bintik hitam. Anak itu menjalani diet bebas gluten, tidak ada pasta BG di menu, dan tidak ada pasta yang diminta. Mereka memasak mi lokal yang lebar, ketika saya meminta lebih matang, karena anak itu tidak mau makan bubur mi, juru masaknya menolak. Apakah sesulit itu untuk membuangnya ke dalam wajan dan melakukan apa yang diminta? Mungkin, tetapi tidak di tempat ini dan tidak dengan layanan ini. Saat sarapan, BG menolak menyediakan makanan, mereka menawarkan untuk mulai keesokan harinya, meskipun hotel telah diperingatkan sebelumnya dan juga sehari sebelumnya. Saya harus bersikeras dan sarapan BG akhirnya muncul dan orang yang menangani masalah ini berubah dan semuanya menjadi baik-baik saja. Kesimpulan - masalahnya ada pada staf. Secara umum, kami tidak merekomendasikan restoran ini sama sekali. Air, bahkan lokal - dibayar di wilayah hotel dan lebih mahal daripada di Dubai bintang lima yang bagus di Jumeirah (meskipun mereka menyediakan air dengan es di pantai gratis). Harga seperti di restoran yang bagus untuk minuman, sementara kualitasnya jauh dari ideal. Ada kekurangan kursi berjemur yang parah, meskipun faktanya wilayahnya luas dan memungkinkan Anda untuk meletakkannya dengan bebas. Kerugian besar bagi manajemen untuk ini. Pusat kebugaran adalah yang terkecil dari semua yang saya temui di ratusan hotel 5 * tempat saya menginap. Dua trek, satu elips dan satu multifungsi dengan dumbel. Itu saja. Sulit membayangkan bagaimana komisi melewatkan momen seperti itu untuk sertifikasi hotel berperingkat lima. Kamar dan kamar mandi yang luas (meskipun beberapa keran airnya berbau dan mixer perlu diganti) pancuran - tekanannya lemah. Juga minus AC berfungsi dengan baik. Tempat tidurnya nyaman, bantalnya kurang nyaman. Balkonnya kecil dan sempit. Restoran di bawah lobi cukup sukses. Saya menyukai layanan dan kualitas hidangannya. Lima yang solid untuk setiap hidangan. Namun, munculnya lalat kotoran di piring berisi makanan menunjukkan masalah kebersihan di dapur dan pembuangan sampah di area hotel. Lalat selalu ada di tempat yang terdapat kotoran organik - minus bagi manajemen. Pantainya adalah salah satu yang terbaik, tetapi itu bukan kelebihan hotel. Tersedia peralatan untuk berselancar. Dengan biaya tambahan. Konsep klub anak-anak mirip dengan pusat kebugaran (kecil dan tanpa anak-anak). Secara umum, manajemen perlu melakukan perbaikan dan semuanya akan baik-baik saja."
"783.","Natalie Wong","2","2025-01-20","1","Kami punya pengalaman buruk di hotel bintang 5 ini. Hotel ini sama sekali tidak sepadan dengan harganya, kamar dengan pemandangan kolam renang kurang privasi karena orang-orang yang berenang di sekitar kolam dapat dengan mudah melihat kami melalui kaca transparan, handuk kotor, dan wastafel yang buruk (pada dasarnya penuh dengan barang-barang lain), bak mandinya kurang bersih. Setelah teknisi datang untuk memperbaikinya (dia memakai sepatu untuk masuk dan menggunakan pompa tanpa membersihkan wastafel setelahnya),"
"784.","Benoit Denicourt","11","2023-01-20","1","Bintang 5, peringkatnya bagus… Tapi ini bukan yang kami dapatkan. Kedatangan berjalan lancar, lokasi dan hotel tampak hebat. Lobi sangat luas dan bagus, hotel ini memiliki banyak ruang terbuka yang luas dan pemandangan indah ke kolam renang dan pantai. Stafnya ramah. Kami menginap 3 malam, malam pertama menyenangkan, kamarnya agak ketinggalan jaman untuk hotel bintang 5, tetapi secara keseluruhan, ini adalah awal yang baik. Lalu, kami mencoba sarapannya, tidak sepadan, banyak pilihan, tetapi sangat rata-rata. Saat itulah kami mengetahui bahwa hotel tersebut menyelenggarakan kompetisi game internasional….mereka mulai membangun panggung dan berbagai tenda di seluruh hotel…selamat tinggal pemandangan pantai, halo pemandangan banyak konstruksi yang sedang berlangsung. Kami tidak lagi berada di hotel bintang 5, melainkan di aula pameran…yang bisa Anda lihat hanyalah konstruksi di mana-mana, dari kolam renang, dari pantai, hanya itu yang bisa Anda lihat. Sangat kecewa, kami tidak berada di surga kecil kami sendiri, melainkan di sebuah acara game…. Selain itu, hanya disediakan 1 gel mandi per kamar, tidak ada mandi busa, yang sangat disayangkan mengingat bak mandi yang begitu bagus. Itu saja belum cukup, Anda mengharapkan lebih dari hotel bintang 5. Restorannya sangat biasa saja dan harganya terlalu mahal. Kamarnya nyaman tetapi agak ketinggalan jaman, tidak memberikan kesan bintang 5. Para kontestan tiba dengan bus di hotel, lobi yang sangat ramai, tidak membuat Anda merasa seperti berada di hotel bintang 5. Stafnya kurang terlatih, ramah, tetapi kurang efisien. Sangat mengecewakan, saya membayar untuk akhir pekan panjang yang damai, dengan pemandangan pantai...itu sama sekali bukan yang saya dapatkan."

Tidak ada cara untuk melakukannya lebih awal. Bukan karena uang, sama sekali bukan. Istri saya akhirnya membuat keributan, dan mereka menerima kami check-in. 2. Saat kami menunggu di lobi, mereka tidak menawarkan minuman atau apa pun. Bahkan air putih pun tidak. 3. Kamar di lantai satu berbau jamur yang sangat menyengat. Mereka memindahkan kami ke lantai dua. 4. Lantai dua berbau limbah, wastafel tidak bisa disiram, dan AC-nya hampir tidak berfungsi. 5. Petugas kebersihan hanya datang sesekali, jadi kami harus memanggil mereka. 6. Restoran lokalnya berbeda cerita. Harganya keterlaluan. Satu porsi makanan harganya 200.000 rubel. Harganya 4 kali lebih murah di mana pun di Bali. Makanannya menjijikkan untuk harga segitu. Suasana di restorannya menjijikkan. Banyak sekali lalat. 7. Namun yang paling menyedihkan adalah, tidak ada kafe yang layak untuk makan dalam jarak berjalan kaki. Bahkan tidak ada toko. Pantai terdekat berjarak 3 kilometer di pinggir jalan. Kelebihan: 1. Pantai yang indah. Pantai terbaik di Bali. 2. Kolam renang yang luas. Namun, wajib hukumnya bagi anak-anak. 3. Internet yang bagus di seluruh area properti."
"786.","Luca Ricciardi","110","2024-01-20","1","Jika Anda mencari surga dan relaksasi, Anda pasti tidak akan menemukannya di sini. Kami tiba larut malam dan diperiksa di pintu masuk seolah-olah kami berada di bandara. Setiap barang bawaan diperiksa seolah-olah kami teroris. Disambut di gedung yang megah, kami diantar ke gedung 4 di lantai empat. Kamarnya bagus, agak usang (terlalu usang), tanpa stopkontak di dekat tempat tidur, dan balkonnya bagus (perlu diketahui bahwa hanya lantai empat yang memiliki balkon besar; jika Anda kurang beruntung mendapatkan kamar di lantai dua atau tiga, Anda akan mendapatkan balkon kecil). Kedap suaranya buruk, dan kami bisa mendengar percakapan normal di kamar lain. Kami mendapat kamar di dekat lift (sangat stres!); setiap kali pintu dibuka, pintunya akan berdering. Bayangkan tinggal di gedung dengan lebih dari 50 kamar dan konser seperti itu bisa terdengar (setelah dua hari mengeluh, mereka memindahkan gedung saya dan menempatkan saya lebih jauh dari lift). Sayang sekali AC di kamar berhenti bekerja setelah seharian. Diperbaiki dengan perawatan selama lima jam (apalagi air berceceran di mana-mana, di baju, koper... sungguh bencana). Manajemen segera meminta maaf, memberi kami cokelat sebagai permintaan maaf (mungkin ganti kamar?). Keesokan harinya, bau tak sedap tercium dari pipa-pipa (apalagi bangun di selokan saja sudah luar biasa). Solusi brilian hotel? Sedikit deodoran dan semuanya baik-baik saja. Para amatir di luar sana. Pantainya...luas, indah, dengan lautan warna-warni yang indah. Sayang sekali pantainya dipenuhi plastik. Saya bertanya kepada pihak hotel mengapa tidak dibersihkan, dan alasan yang mereka berikan lebih buruk daripada kebenaran: Kami membersihkan pantai dua kali sehari, salah alam kalau plastik meninggalkannya. Ya sudahlah. Nyatanya, semuanya mengapung di laut. Sandal jepit, gelas, peralatan makan, ransel, sikat gigi—saya rasa luar biasa untuk pantai yang menyebut dirinya pulau surga (mungkin lebih tepatnya pulau sampah!). Saya terhibur karena, berbicara dengan orang Italia lainnya, pantai-pantai lain di pulau ini bahkan lebih buruk! Hotel ini setidaknya memiliki kolam renang yang indah dan terawat dengan staf yang sangat ramah. Mungkin kolam renang anak-anak, dengan airnya yang sangat keruh, sebaiknya tidak digunakan... Sarapannya luar biasa, berlimpah (agak repetitif...), tetapi sangat enak. Bahkan ada kapel kaca yang indah tempat Anda bisa menikah (kami sudah membayar, kalau tidak, itu akan menjadi ide yang bagus). Kami telah melihat beberapa pernikahan dirayakan, yang sungguh indah (sayang sekali menemukan halaman tertutup plastik dan tidak pernah dibersihkan selama berhari-hari). Mereka bahkan bisa melakukannya tanpa koktail selamat datang; itu segelas es dengan sedikit teh; akan lebih baik jika Anda tidak menyediakannya. Ide menyediakan botol air kaca (330ml) di kamar sangat bagus. Hotel ini terletak tak jauh dari semacam pusat perbelanjaan turis kecil dengan apotek, tetapi jika Anda keluar dari area parkir karyawan dan kemudian menuju Nusa Dua, ada jalan kecil lain dengan harga yang jauh lebih murah. Intinya: jika Anda berpikir untuk datang ke sini demi pantai, lupakan saja. Anda akan menghabiskan waktu di kolam renang (dan tidak perlu datang sejauh ini hanya untuk bersantai di kolam renang). Jika Anda menggunakannya untuk mengunjungi pulau, lupakan saja. Jaraknya dua jam dari mana-mana, dan saya sarankan memesan hotel di utara pulau. Lautnya penuh dengan plastik. Menginap di Merusaka (seperti halnya area Nusa Dua lainnya) pada dasarnya berarti menginap di tempat yang harganya lima kali lipat lebih mahal, dan Anda akan menghabiskan waktu bertanya-tanya, Untuk apa saya datang?"
"787.","Valeriia Podolian","10","2024-01-20","1","Satu-satunya hal positif dari hotel ini adalah lokasinya yang dekat dengan pantai dan laut. Pantainya indah dan bersih, dan tersedia kursi berjemur di bawah pohon. Hanya itu saja. Hotelnya sendiri besar dan berfokus bukan pada akomodasi berkualitas, melainkan pada jumlah tamu yang memenuhi kamar. Kamar mandinya selalu berbau limbah, dan kerannya bocor. Kulkas di kamar terasa panas, sehingga mustahil untuk meninggalkan buah atau obat di dalamnya. Kami meminta agar kulkas diperbaiki, dan seorang petugas datang dan menyesuaikan suhunya. Dan tidak ada yang berubah. Harga makan siang dan makan malam lebih mahal daripada di hotel Hilton dan Radission. Pelayanannya lambat dan tidak menyenangkan. Kami meminta buah yang harus kami potong dan diberitahu bahwa kami harus membayarnya. Ketika kami membayar dan meminta garpu untuk buah tersebut, kami diberitahu bahwa kami tidak boleh makan buah di mana pun kecuali di dalam kamar agar tidak ada orang lain yang melihat. Kami harus meminta garpu secara terpisah dari layanan kamar. Saya juga sempat bermasalah dengan pelayan ketika saya memintanya untuk tidak menambahkan lada ke makanan saya karena saya punya alergi. Pria itu membawa paprika tanpa paprika dan meninggalkan sedikit cabai di sana. 🤷🏻‍♀️. Bangunannya sendiri sudah tua dan perlu sedikit perbaikan kosmetik, begitu pula kolam renangnya. Hotel ini sering menyelenggarakan berbagai acara untuk 100-200 orang. Musiknya mengalun kencang di seluruh hotel, terkadang bahkan di malam hari. Jika Anda mencari liburan yang santai, saya sangat tidak merekomendasikannya. Beberapa hari saja sudah cukup, tetapi tidak lebih dari seminggu. Saya tidak akan kembali ke sini lagi."

Dan dengan cuaca Bali seperti ini, kita benar-benar butuh AC yang bagus.

Dua kali saya memesan segelas anggur merah dari Australia, dan pelayan datang dengan anggur merah dua pulau dari Bali… Sering kali dalam seminggu, garpu dan pisau kami hilang di meja, kami harus meminta bantuan mereka, sungguh luar biasa. Untuk sarapan, ada antrean dan kami harus menunggu lama sebelum mendapatkan meja (tanpa peralatan makan tentunya). Prasmanannya juga tidak dikelola dengan baik, sering kali barang-barang hilang. Mereka butuh 10 menit untuk mengisi ulang bacon, dll. Hotelnya sangat berisik dengan banyak anak-anak yang berlarian dan berteriak. Di kamar tidur kami, ada masalah dengan shower dan saya mulai berisik pada pukul 7 pagi. 2 kali mereka membersihkan kamar saya setelah pukul 3 sore, meskipun saya sudah memasang tanda tolong bersihkan pada pukul 8 pagi. Saya bahkan harus komplain ke resepsionis karena kamar saya baru dibersihkan pukul 3 sore. Saya menulis ini pukul 3:12 sore di depan kamar saya, sementara petugasnya masih membersihkan. Saya memesan kopi di kolam renang, dan butuh 10 menit untuk sampai. Begitu juga dengan kelapa. Mereka punya happy hour dari pukul 5 sampai 7, tetapi mereka bilang tutup pukul 6:30.

Sarapan prasmanannya biasa saja. Stafnya ramah. Ukuran kamarnya cukup besar. Tamu-tamu lain sama sekali tidak ramah.

Pukul 10:30 pagi setelah sarapan, kami tidak bisa masuk ke kamar karena mereka memblokir kartu kunci kami; saya dan istri saya bersama seorang anak berusia satu tahun dan seorang anak berusia enam tahun di jalan tidak bisa masuk ke kamar. Sungguh sikap yang mengerikan terhadap kami, saya bahkan tidak punya waktu untuk menukar uang, meskipun saya sudah meninggalkan deposit. Mengapa saya harus membayar banyak uang? Pelayanan terburuk dalam hidup saya, saya tidak akan pernah kembali ke hotel ini."
"793.","Aleksandra","34","2024-01-20","1","Saya menginap di hotel Merusaka Nusa Dua benar-benar bencana. Meskipun ratingnya bintang lima dan standarnya tinggi, stafnya ternyata sama sekali tidak jujur. Departemen rumah tangga sangat tidak dapat dipercaya, MENCURI UANG dari kamar selama pembersihan. Dan apa yang diusulkan pihak keamanan? Mereka menyarankan untuk menginventarisasi ruangan dan memotret semua yang dimiliki tamu, hanya untuk membuktikan bahwa tamu tersebut salah meletakkan barang yang hilang. Ini sungguh tidak masuk akal! Ini cara sempurna untuk membuktikan bahwa uang telah hilang??? Meskipun makanan di hotel enak, keseluruhan pengalaman dirusak oleh ketidakpuasan yang terjadi sepanjang waktu. Restoran itu benar-benar kacau - saya menunggu selama 30 menit untuk kopi pesanan saya, dan meja-mejanya sering kali kotor dan tidak dibersihkan. Bahkan mendapatkan pisau dan garpu membutuhkan waktu lama. Dan toilet di kamar saya hanyalah sebuah tragedi. Itu bocor, dan flushnya rusak. Saya melaporkannya tiga kali selama lima hari saya tinggal, dan tidak ada tindakan apa pun mengenai hal itu. Bayangkan, di hotel bintang 5, mereka tidak bisa memperbaiki toilet! Tapi bukan itu saja. Hanya menyediakan satu handuk besar untuk kamar dengan dua orang? Dengan serius? Masalah lainnya adalah kekurangan menu. Saya akan bertanya tentang suatu hidangan, mereka akan mengatakan mereka memilikinya, tetapi ketika saya datang setelah satu jam, ternyata hidangan tersebut tidak tersedia. Selain itu, pantainya penuh dengan DRONE, dan staf tidak melakukan kontrol apa pun. Saya harus menahan suara mendengung sepanjang hari. Dan yang lebih buruk lagi, mereka mengizinkan pengunjung pantai untuk syuting di pantai hotel pribadi! Dimana privasi dan keamanan para tamu? Singkatnya, pengalaman menginap saya di hotel Merusaka Nusa Dua adalah mimpi buruk. Saya tidak bisa merekomendasikan tempat ini kepada siapa pun. Standar yang tinggi tidak berarti apa-apa jika stafnya tidak jujur, makanannya meninggalkan rasa tidak enak, toiletnya rusak, dan kurangnya pengaturan dan kontrol menghalangi relaksasi."

Ketika saya membantu tamu saya untuk meminta teh sore dan koktail malam disajikan di kamar, Butler bernama MESHA menolak permintaan tersebut dengan tegas tanpa ada isyarat mewah atau layanan penuh perhatian. Sepertinya dia perlu dilatih untuk terlibat dengan tamu atau perwakilan tamu dalam hal keterlibatan mewah. Tamu tersebut membutuhkan teh sore dan koktail malam untuk disajikan di vila karena mereka memiliki layanan pijat yang termasuk pada pukul 3 sore dan akan berakhir pada pukul 4 sore, mereka perlu beristirahat dan menikmati vila mereka alih-alih menikmati restoran. Ini adalah hotel bintang 5, bukan bintang 3 atau bintang 4, jadi daripada menolak permintaan tamu, Mesha lebih baik mencari cara untuk mengakomodasi permintaan tamu. Dia bahkan tidak memanggil staf terkait yang akan menyajikan teh sore dan koktail malam, tetapi menolak dengan tegas dan menunjukkan sikap arogan."
"795.","Victor Hugo Cruz","9","2024-01-20","1","Hotelnya bagus, sarapannya agak buruk, tetapi bagian terburuknya adalah pantainya. Sudah umum diketahui bahwa Bali cenderung tercemar, tetapi tidak seperti hotel lain yang membersihkan pantai tepat di depan mereka, Merusaka membiarkan sampah menumpuk begitu saja. Mungkin mereka kekurangan staf, tetapi itu benar-benar merusak pengalaman hotel bintang 5. Mengapa tidak ikut serta dan membantu lingkungan dengan memungut semua sampah plastik dan styrofoam yang berserakan di pantai?"
"796.","Shaun Norden","12","2024-01-20","1","Jangan buang waktu dan uang Anda. Ulasan ini berdasarkan pengalaman kami dan hotel-hotel tersebut mengklaim sebagai Fasilitas Bintang 5. Mari kita mulai dengan hal-hal baiknya: - Kolam renang di area umum sangat bagus, tamannya sangat indah. Akses pantai sangat baik. Seperti biasa, orang Bali sangat ramah. Itulah sifat alami mereka yang ingin menyenangkan Anda. Hal itu terjadi di seluruh pulau dan bukan hanya di hotel ini. - Lokasi ke distrik perbelanjaan sekitar 700 m berjalan kaki - Wanita yang mengelola restoran ketika Anda meminta meja sangat ramah 10/10. - Kekurangannya: - Dekorasi kamar sudah tua, usang, dan perlu diperbarui agar mendekati bintang 5. - TV menggunakan layanan streaming berbasis jaringan yang terus-menerus gagal, kualitas streamingnya buruk dan membuat frustrasi karena sangat lambat. Acara sering terputus. Sebagai seorang IT, ini adalah masalah infrastruktur jaringan. Streaming multicast & unicast membebani jaringan. AC-nya bikin tenggorokan kering, bangun pagi-pagi banget sakit tenggorokan, nggak bisa matiin AC karena kamar jadi panas banget. Kamar kami punya kolam renang langsung, ada jamur hitam di dek kolam renang dan sampai ke kolam renang. Kenapa harus memasukkan kayu ke air kolam? Sejujurnya, ini pilihan yang buruk dari pihak yang membangun. Dan mengganggu kalau mau bersantai di kolam renang. Pancuran kamarnya nggak berfungsi sama sekali. Sarapannya kayak perkemahan sekolah, berisik anak-anak dan nggak ada AC. Makanannya kayak sizzler, roti dan kue keringnya dibekukan terus dipanaskan ulang. Kalau beli sesuatu di sini, beli telur aja. Makanan lainnya kualitasnya jelek, untuk ukuran hotel bintang 5. Yang paling buruk: -Ada konstruksi di sebelah kamar kami selama jam kerja. Suara dentuman dan gesekan terus-menerus. Waktu kami komplain, kami dikasih tahu kalau kamarnya bakal berhenti jam 5 sore. Waktu kami minta kamar lain, kami dikasih tahu kalau kamarnya sudah penuh. Saya menghubungi manajer hotel yang mengaku ditawari kamar lain di hari pertama. Intinya, kami lebih suka menginap di kamar yang berisik. Sejujurnya, kami tidak percaya dengan tanggapan ini. Intinya, seluruh pengalaman ini adalah kesalahan kami. Ringkasan: Ada banyak hotel bagus di Nusa Dua dengan harga segitu. Saran saya, pergilah ke tempat lain saja dan Anda akan mendapatkan pengalaman yang lebih baik. Kami ditawari satu malam gratis untuk kembali ke hotel ini. Saya lebih suka mendapatkan kembali sebagian uang saya karena kami merasa benar-benar ditipu saat kami pergi. Kami baru saja kembali dari Anantara di Uluwatu, menikmati pengalaman yang berbeda siang dan malam dengan harga yang kurang lebih sama. Anantara jauh lebih unggul dari tempat ini."
"797.","Philipp Kreysa","2","2023-01-20","1","Meskipun Hotelnya bagus, begitu ada masalah, Staf tidak mampu mengatasinya. Setelah tiba dari perjalanan 17 jam dengan 2 anak, kami dipesan ke kamar dengan AC rusak. Setelah melaporkan hal ini pada malam yang sama, kami masih harus tinggal di kamar itu sampai keesokan harinya. Setiap orang tua dengan 2 anak yang kelelahan tahu bahwa ini adalah mimpi buruk! Keesokan harinya kami pindah ke kamar yang satu lantai dengan - tetapi lebih tua dan bahkan kurang terawat. Akhirnya saat check out ketika meminta untuk mengakomodasi kami atas ketidaknyamanan kami, kami pada dasarnya diberitahu oleh manajemen bahwa AC yang rusak bukanlah masalah mereka dan mereka sudah mengakomodasi kami dengan pindah kamar. Saya kira menurut pendapat mereka kita seharusnya tinggal di kamar dengan AC yang rusak! Pengalaman yang benar-benar menjengkelkan dan tidak ada rasa pelayanan untuk tempat semahal itu! Saya tidak merekomendasikan menginap - ada Hotel bagus serupa dengan layanan yang lebih baik!"
"798.","Gompi Flores","6","2024-01-20","1","Hari ini hari pertama saya di hotel ini dan saya sangat kecewa dengan kamar yang diberikan. Saya akan mulai dengan mengatakan bahwa AC-nya rusak dan meneteskan air. Saya menelepon resepsionis dan mereka membawakan saya keset kamar mandi untuk lantai. Gagang shower rusak dan selang showernya kotor dan berkarat. Bagi saya, ini bukan hotel bintang 5. Saya meminta kamar lain dan mereka memberi saya sejuta alasan agar saya tidak jadi bertanya. Makanannya sangat asin dan tidak enak. Semoga kunjungan saya di sini terbayar dengan menjelajahi Bali."
"799.","gohjp17","4","2025-01-20","1","Saya akan mengunggah videonya secara terpisah ke YouTube. Apakah mereka mengabaikan saya karena saya orang Korea? Atau apakah mereka mengabaikan saya karena saya tidak bisa berbahasa Inggris dengan baik? Mereka mengirim saya ke kamar dengan AC yang rusak. Tukang reparasi AC datang, tetapi setelah 30 menit, AC-nya masih belum diperbaiki. Mereka bilang AC akan dingin jika saya menunggu 30 menit hingga satu jam lagi, tetapi saya tidak percaya. Saya dan keluarga saya berkeringat deras di kamar, tidak bisa mandi. Ketika saya meminta untuk pindah kamar, mereka tidak merespons. Saya meminta mereka untuk datang dan memeriksa, tetapi mereka tidak datang. Satu jam kemudian, saya mengeluh ke resepsionis, dan mereka hanya memberi saya satu kamar. Mereka bilang akan memeriksa ulang dan memberi saya kamar, tetapi satu jam berlalu dan mereka masih belum mendapat kabar. Saya menelepon dan marah, dan baru setelah itu mereka memberi saya kunci. Ngomong-ngomong, kamar tempat saya pindah juga tidak sejuk. Saya sudah menginap di delapan hotel di Bali, dan saya tidak habis pikir kenapa hotel bintang lima bisa punya kondisi kamar, layanan resepsionis, dan pelayanan yang begitu buruk dibandingkan hotel kelas bawah. Orang Korea seharusnya lebih hemat dan pergi ke tempat lain. Pemandangan dan akses pantainya bagus."
"800.","Sharon Slimper","2","2023-01-20","1","Kamar resor dalam blok. Kamar memiliki balkon kecil yang menghadap langsung ke balkon lain dengan satu kursi dan meja. Tidak ada laci untuk pakaian, kami menggunakan rak bagasi. Dekorasi dan makanan sarapannya menarik, tetapi kami menikmati 2 makan malam yang luar biasa. Tidak ada nuansa Bali di area kolam renang, tamannya perlu diperhatikan. Sangat kecewa dan tidak akan kembali."

Saat check-out, saya melihat helm saya sudah ditukar dengan yang lain, lebih kotor dan bekas. Ketika saya sampai di resepsionis, mereka bilang itu bukan salah mereka karena parkirnya umum. Yang saya tidak mengerti adalah parkirnya ada di dalam hotel (jadi tidak umum) dan mereka punya petugas keamanan, tetapi tidak ada kamera di area ini. Jadi, harap berhati-hati saat berkendara dengan mobil atau motor. Jika terjadi pencurian, itu bukan tanggung jawab mereka."

Di tengah terik matahari yang mencapai hampir 4 derajat Celcius, kami mendapati diri kami berada di kamar dengan AC, kulkas, dan kipas angin yang tidak berfungsi. Hal ini membuat kami sangat tidak nyaman, terutama dengan anak-anak. Kami segera melaporkan masalah ini, dan meskipun teknisi telah dikirim ke kamar kami dua kali, masalah tersebut tetap tidak terselesaikan. Kurangnya respons yang efektif ini mengecewakan dan menambah ketidaknyamanan kami. Di tengah ketidaknyamanan ini, pihak hotel menawarkan kamar alternatif pada pukul 1 dini hari. Namun, kamar yang ditawarkan berada di gedung yang berbeda, yang bukan solusi praktis bagi kami yang bepergian dengan anak-anak. Secara keseluruhan, layanan di Merusaka Nusa Dua mengecewakan. Kegagalan untuk segera memperbaiki fasilitas penting, ditambah dengan solusi yang kurang memuaskan yang ditawarkan, sangat memengaruhi pengalaman menginap kami. Saya berharap mendapatkan pengalaman yang jauh lebih baik, terutama mengingat reputasi tempat ini."

Saya memesan hotel ini dengan harapan akan mendapatkan pengalaman menginap yang spektakuler mengingat semua ulasan bagus yang kami lihat di internet. Sayangnya, sejauh ini kami mengalami pengalaman menginap yang sangat tidak menyenangkan. Kamar saya dan suami terasa sangat panas saat masuk. Kami pikir AC akan menyala setelah beberapa jam, tetapi ternyata tidak. Suhu di luar mencapai 30 derajat Fahrenheit dan kamar kami bahkan lebih panas lagi. Saya menelepon resepsionis pukul 18.30 untuk memberi tahu mereka. Kami pergi makan malam dan kembali ke hotel pukul 22.00, tetapi ternyata belum diperbaiki. Jadi saya menelepon kembali untuk memberi tahu mereka. Kami menunggu hampir satu jam untuk mendapatkan kamar pengganti, hanya untuk mendapatkan kamar lain dengan AC yang setengah rusak dan panas. Jadi kami menunggu lagi selama 40 menit dan saat itu hampir pukul 24.00, tetapi akhirnya mereka memberi kami kamar dengan AC yang berfungsi. Sayangnya, kamar tersebut memiliki bau cat dinding/kayu yang menyengat dan kamar itu adalah kamar dengan dua tempat tidur. Kami sudah terlalu lelah saat itu karena sudah mendekati tengah malam, jadi kami memutuskan untuk menuruti saja. Pengalaman yang sangat mengecewakan dan sungguh tidak menyangka akan mendapatkan pengalaman seperti ini dari hotel bintang 5 yang populer. Kami sudah beberapa kali ke Bali dan menginap di banyak hotel bintang 5 di seluruh pulau, tetapi belum pernah mengalami pengalaman yang tidak memuaskan seperti ini. Kami pasti tidak akan kembali."

PS: Staf awalnya baik, tetapi kemudian manajer jaga tim datang dan bahkan tidak meminta maaf atas ketidaknyamanan yang kami alami. Jangan juga meng-upgrade kamar dengan akses kolam renang menjadi lebih baik daripada kamar deluxe meskipun harganya lebih mahal."

Kami mengalami pengalaman buruk hari ini: Suami saya dan saya tiba di kolam renang pukul 8.30, pergi ke konter handuk, dan seorang pria berpakaian seperti staf keluar dan mengambil uang tunai 300.000. Dia memberi kami dua handuk dan bilang akan membawakan vouchernya nanti. Kami berbaring di kursi santai, tetapi tidak ada yang membawakan voucher untuk kami. Tiga jam kemudian, kami pergi ke konter sendiri, diantar ke bar, lalu kembali ke konter. Kami berjalan-jalan seperti itu selama sekitar 30 menit. Seluruh staf keluar dan mulai menuduh kami tidak membayar biaya menginap karena mereka tidak dapat menemukan pria yang mengambil uang kami. Ketika kami meminta untuk memeriksa kamera CCTV, mereka bilang tidak ada. Suasana hati kami hancur. Jika staf mencuri, hadapi stafnya, jangan salahkan tamu karena tidak membayar tagihan! Parahnya lagi, pas kami lagi panik-paniknya dan mau masuk ke mobil, stafnya malah lari ke arah kami dan nanya handuknya dicuri. Ini benar-benar gagal total, teman-teman. Perlakuan kayak gini ke tamu nggak bisa diterima!"
"807.","Shang Chen","13","2023-01-20","1","Untuk hotel bintang lima, layanan dan kamarnya kurang memuaskan. Antrean check-in panjang, tidak ada staf yang menawarkan untuk mengambil bagasi kami. Ukuran kamarnya lumayan, tetapi AC-nya tidak berfungsi dengan baik, saluran pembuangannya sangat bau. Semut ada di mana-mana. Sebelumnya saya pernah menginap di Royal Tulip di Jimbaran, sungguh luar biasa, harganya setengahnya, dan layanannya dua kali lebih baik. Seharusnya saya menginap di sana sepanjang perjalanan."

Ayolah, Anda hotel bintang 5, bukan bintang 2 atau 3. Sayang sekali! Dan mereka hanya memberi kami segelas teh sebagai kompensasi. 😅 Kami tidak membutuhkannya.

"809.","Markus Hornung","3","2024-01-20","1","Saya baru-baru ini menginap di Hotel Merusaka di Nusa Dua dan itu benar-benar mimpi buruk!!! Stafnya benar-benar tidak kompeten dan tidak tahu bagaimana menangani masalah-masalah mendasar. Ketika kami tiba, kamar saya belum siap dan saya harus menunggu lama sebelum akhirnya mendapatkan kamar yang kotor dan bau dengan pancuran yang rusak. Ketika saya mengeluh, mereka memberi saya kamar lain yang tepat di sebelah sebuah pesta yang ramai, jadi saya tidak bisa tidur sama sekali. Bahkan setelah tiga kali mencoba, mereka tidak dapat memberi kami kamar yang sesuai dan seluruh prosesnya memakan waktu tiga jam. Lebih parah lagi, staf terus-menerus berjalan mondar-mandir di koridor dan berbicara di walkie-talkie mereka hingga larut malam, jadi saya tidak bisa tidur bahkan saat itu. Jelas bahwa hotel ini tidak memperhatikan kebutuhan tamunya dan kurang terorganisir. Secara keseluruhan, saya sangat menyarankan siapa pun untuk menghindari Hotel Merusaka di Nusa Dua. Ada banyak hotel lain di area ini yang menawarkan layanan pelanggan yang lebih baik, lingkungan yang lebih bersih, dan pengalaman yang lebih menyenangkan. Hotel ini adalah bencana dan mimpi buruk bagi siapa pun yang menginginkan liburan yang santai. Pertama-tama, stafnya jelas tidak mampu menyambut tamu dengan baik dan memenuhi kebutuhan mereka. Kenyataan bahwa kami harus menunggu untuk check-in ke kamar yang kotor dan bau saat tiba di hotel sungguh tidak dapat diterima. Saat kami menunggu kamar di restoran, kami disambut oleh staf yang arogan dan tidak kompeten. Bahkan setelah saya mengeluh dan diberi kamar baru, hal itu tetap tidak dapat diterima, karena letaknya di sebelah tempat pesta yang ramai. Staf yang berjalan di lorong di tengah malam dengan suara yang sangat keras juga tidak dapat diterima. Ini menunjukkan bahwa hotel tidak memperhatikan kebutuhan tamunya dan benar-benar tidak terorganisir. Secara keseluruhan, Hotel Merusaka di Nusa Dua sayangnya benar-benar mimpi buruk, dan saya sangat menyarankan untuk menghindarinya. Ada banyak hotel lain di area ini yang menawarkan layanan pelanggan yang jauh lebih baik, lingkungan yang lebih bersih, dan pengalaman yang lebih menyenangkan."
"810.","Brooke Marr","1","2021-01-20","1","Sejujurnya saya tidak tahu mengapa tempat ini mendapat peringkat yang begitu tinggi. Setelah menghabiskan lebih dari seminggu di Bali dan 3 resor lainnya, ini JAUH lebih mahal dari semuanya, dan paling tidak bernilai uang. Sangat mengecewakan. Pertama, kami tidak diizinkan check-in sedetik pun sebelum pukul 15.00, yang sudah sangat buruk. Kedua, karena kami tidak bisa check-in, kami harus berkeliling selama 10 menit sambil membawa ransel berisi perlengkapan fotografi yang tampaknya mencurigakan bagi petugas keamanan di area tersebut, sehingga kami diinterogasi dengan kasar apakah kami tamu di sini. Membayar lebih dari 500 NZD selama 2 malam untuk dibuat merasa seperti penjahat adalah kesan pertama yang menjijikkan. Kami melanjutkan berjalan-jalan di sekitar area tersebut. Tempatnya tidak terlalu kotor atau semacamnya, tetapi jelas BUKAN seperti yang terlihat di foto. Pada dasarnya, tempat ini adalah lapangan terbuka yang luas dan kosong dengan kolam renang sederhana dan seratus kursi berjemur yang dipadatkan di beberapa area kecil dengan tempat sampah yang meluap. Sepertinya tidak ada perhatian terhadap detail di sini karena semuanya sangat sangat sederhana. Lalu, setelah dibawa ke kamar kami yang sangat gelap dan kuno dengan 2 tempat tidur single yang disatukan, saya benar-benar kecewa dengan gagasan untuk menghabiskan sisa 2 hari liburan yang luar biasa di sini. Saya pergi ke resepsionis dengan harapan mendapatkan pengembalian dana agar kami bisa pergi ke tempat lain. Tidak ada bantuan sama sekali. Mereka hanya menawarkan kamar yang berbeda, kategori yang sama tetapi dengan tempat tidur ganda. Bahkan, kamar ini memiliki setengah dari kolam renang (yang tidak terlalu pribadi) karena kami menghadap ke area yang sangat kecil dan dinding bata! Yang bisa saya katakan adalah, kesan yang kami rasakan di sini adalah Anda bukan pelanggan yang berharga, Anda hanyalah nomor lain yang datang. Tidak ada upaya yang dilakukan untuk mengubah pandangan kami terhadap resor ini. Jika Anda pasangan dan mencari sesuatu yang romantis DAN jika Anda ingin merasa seperti berada di Bali, jangan buang-buang uang Anda. Resor lain di dekatnya adalah Melia Bali yang harganya setengahnya dan benar-benar indah!!!! Mereka sangat memperhatikan detail di area mereka dan staf mereka sangat berterima kasih atas kunjungan Anda. Inaya Putri terasa seperti berada di tempat lain di dunia, tetapi rasanya sama sekali tidak seperti Bali. Dua hari terakhir liburan yang begitu indah di Bali sungguh mengecewakan. Saya sangat sedih karena harus pulang, tetapi sekarang saya tidak sabar."
"811.","Nico Griesbaum","3","2023-01-20","1","Resornya lumayan, kecuali faktanya cukup sering ada perusahaan yang menginap di sana dengan jumlah karyawan yang banyak untuk merayakan sesuatu (berpesta). Minggu lalu, sekelompok besar karyawan dari sebuah perusahaan membuat keributan yang sangat mengganggu sepanjang hari di pantai (musik yang sangat keras, pengumuman, permainan, dll.). Kami terpaksa meninggalkan pantai. Kemarin malam, sekelompok besar orang mengadakan pesta di gedung yang sangat dekat dengan kamar kami. Musiknya lagi-lagi sangat keras dan mengganggu. Hari ini, Jumat, waktunya berpesta lagi, artinya selama 4 hari dari jam 6 sore, kami tidak bisa bersantai di pantai atau di sekitar kolam renang. Jika Anda, seperti saya, ingin bersantai di resor yang tenang dan nyaman, saya sangat merekomendasikan Merusaka."
"812.","Thomas Burt","9","2023-01-20","1","Tempat ini terlihat bagus dari resepsionis, tetapi begitu sampai di sana, kamarnya gelap dan suram. Banyak staf yang tersenyum dan menyapa, tetapi tidak menawarkan bantuan apa pun dan seolah-olah mengabaikan Anda. Rasanya aneh! Saya dan pasangan saya memesan 4 malam di sana dan pergi setelah 3 jam. Kami tidak merasa nyaman dan senang kami pergi! Jelas bukan hotel bintang 5!"
"813.","やっしー","113","2019-01-20","1","Saya ingin menginap di hotel bintang 5 di Nusa Dua, jadi saya memilih hotel dengan bathtub dan harga di bawah 20.000 yen per malam demi ketenangan pikiran. Namun, ekspektasi saya pupus. Hari ke-2: Koper saya, yang saya tinggalkan di kamar, tidak terkunci saat saya pergi. Hari ke-3: Saya mengganti kombinasi kunci koper, tetapi seseorang pasti telah mencoba membukanya saat saya pergi, karena kombinasi kuncinya telah diganti. Saya memiliki sekitar 50.000 yen uang tunai yang disembunyikan di dalam sekantong permen kenyal jus buah di dalam koper, tetapi untungnya tidak ada yang dicuri. Namun, ada risiko narkoba telah ditanam di dalamnya dan saya akan dilaporkan ke polisi dan dimintai suap, jadi saya akhirnya harus memeriksa koper dan semua barang bawaan di dalamnya secara menyeluruh. (Saya pernah mendengar seorang kenalan saya pernah mengalami pengalaman buruk ketika seseorang menemukan selembar kertas berisi narkoba terselip di dalam buku di dalam kopernya.) Saya juga menyimpan salinan kartu kredit saya di dalam koper untuk berjaga-jaga jika hilang, jadi sekarang saya perlu memeriksanya untuk memastikan kartu saya tidak digunakan secara curang di kemudian hari. Ketika saya melaporkan hal ini kepada manajer jaga, ia mengatakan akan menyelidikinya, dan saya mendengar hasil penyelidikannya keesokan harinya. Ia bersikeras, Kami telah mengidentifikasi petugas kebersihannya, dan ia mengatakan tidak pernah mencoba membuka koper itu. Ketika saya bertanya, Tidak ada yang akan jujur ​​tentang percobaan pencurian, kan? ia menjawab, Ada kamera pengawas di area umum seperti lorong, dan petugas kebersihannya terlatih dengan baik. Kepala bagian kebersihan memeriksa semua barang bawaan sebelum dan sesudah membersihkan, jadi mustahil bagi mereka untuk mencuri barang bawaan dari kamar tamu. Saya pernah membaca ulasan berbahasa Inggris tentang pencurian perhiasan, jadi saya bertanya, Kalau barangnya kecil seperti uang tunai atau perhiasan, bukankah mungkin mereka menyembunyikannya di pot bunga atau semacamnya saat dibersihkan lalu membawanya pulang? Dia menjawab, Bagaimanapun, kami mohon Anda percaya pada kami. Apakah Anda punya bukti bahwa kopernya sudah dibuka? Saya juga marah dan bertanya, Apakah tamu bertanggung jawab menyimpan bukti bagasi di hotel bintang 5? Saya akan membatalkan sisa masa inap saya dan menginap di hotel lain, jadi saya ingin pengembalian dana. Namun, mereka menolak, mengatakan mereka tidak bisa memberi saya pengembalian dana, jadi saya memutuskan itu buang-buang waktu dan menyerah. Sebagai catatan tambahan, staf di meja depan, concierge, restoran, dll. semuanya ramah, sangat sopan, dan sangat membantu. Namun, tidak ada yang bisa berbahasa Jepang. Semua staf fasih berbahasa Inggris, dan beberapa bisa berbahasa Mandarin. Kolam renangnya juga cukup luas dan menyenangkan. Berikut beberapa hal yang mengganggu saya sebagai hotel bintang 5 dibandingkan dengan hotel bintang 5 ternama di luar negeri: Pantainya tampak agak terlalu kumuh untuk standar Jepang, tetapi saya rasa itu tidak dapat dihindari mengingat ombak yang tinggi dan sampah yang berserakan di sekitar area tersebut. Ada petugas kebersihan, tetapi sepertinya solusi mendasar tidak akan mungkin dilakukan tanpa menggunakan mesin seperti pembersih pantai yang ditarik traktor. Untuk kamar, pintunya terbuat dari sepotong kayu, jadi tidak terlalu kedap udara dan Anda dapat mendengar suara bising dari luar. Kamar saya dekat dengan lift, tetapi saya dapat mendengar bel pintu lift saat saya tidur. Tentu saja, percakapan di lorong mudah terdengar. Saya bisa tidur nyenyak bahkan di tengah kebisingan, jadi itu tidak mengganggu saya, tetapi jika kebisingan mengganggu Anda, saya sarankan untuk menghindarinya. TV di kamar terkadang tidak menyala, jadi saya melepas kunci kartu kamar, mematikan pemutus arus, dan menunggu beberapa saat hingga berfungsi kembali. Ini juga poin kecil, tapi kulkas di kamar kurang dingin. Mungkin ini karena kinerja kulkasnya, karena ditempatkan di wadah kayu, panas terperangkap di dalamnya, dan letak kulkasnya perlu diperbaiki. Soal makanan, saya rasa makanannya bisa lebih enak di luar, baik dari segi rasa maupun harga. Secara keseluruhan, meskipun hotel ini tampak seperti milik orang Indonesia, rasanya agak kurang dibandingkan hotel bintang 5 asing yang terkenal, atau mungkin kurang mewah. Saya merasakan perbedaannya pada detail-detail kecilnya. Kalau bukan karena masalah koper, saya pasti akan memberi 4 bintang."

Seprai kotor dan tua. AC kamar bocor, dan juga penuh serangga & semut. Kulkas mini tidak berfungsi dengan baik. Sarapan prasmanannya kurang internasional dan pilihannya kurang cocok untuk wisatawan Arab. Spa bisa menjadi pengalaman terburuk yang pernah saya alami, lampunya tidak dimatikan, dan minyak yang digunakan berbau tidak sedap. Perabotan kamarnya tua.

"820.","K. E.","8","2020-01-20","1","Sangat mengecewakan. Untuk bulan madu kami, kami ingin memanjakan diri dengan menginap di resor mewah bintang 5 selama beberapa hari terakhir perjalanan kami di Bali sebelum pulang. Sayangnya, rencana itu gagal total dan menjadi pengalaman terburuk yang kami alami selama tiga minggu di Bali. Empat malam di Inaya membuat kami merasa rindu rumah, perasaan yang belum pernah kami alami sebelumnya selama liburan, dan terutama seharusnya tidak kami rasakan selama bulan madu kami. Satu-satunya hal yang bisa diterima adalah lokasinya yang tepat di pantai (kecuali di hari terakhir) & kunjungan ke restoran untuk makan malam. Hanya di sanalah pelayanan dan makanannya benar-benar baik (meskipun harganya sangat mahal dibandingkan dengan tempat lain di Bali, setidaknya makanannya jauh lebih enak daripada di Bali Collection). Terutama hal-hal berikut ini yang sangat mengecewakan: - Wifi: kualitasnya buruk setelah terhubung - Sarapan: Pertama, Anda harus mendaftar untuk sarapan, lalu dipersilakan duduk oleh staf. Jika Anda beruntung, prosedur ini hanya memakan waktu 15 menit. Tidak ada pilihan tempat duduk gratis, meja-meja lapang bagus di depan khusus disediakan untuk tamu, kami tidak tahu siapa. Ketika kami bertanya apakah kami boleh duduk di salah satu meja kosong, jawabannya adalah tidak, sudah ada yang duduk di sini, padahal selama kami sarapan, tidak ada yang datang ke meja ini. Suasana di ruang sarapan mengingatkan kita pada stasiun kereta yang penuh sesak, sangat berisik, dan penuh orang. Ketika akhirnya kita duduk di meja dan cukup beruntung untuk langsung memesan kopi, teh, atau jus, akan butuh waktu lama sampai kita mendapatkan minuman dan semoga pesanan kita lengkap. Jika ingin kopi atau jus lagi, kita harus mencari pelayan untuk memesan, terkadang butuh lebih dari 30 menit atau kita harus melambaikan tangan selama beberapa menit agar pelayan menyadari keberadaan kita. Sementara itu, piring kotor kita bisa setinggi menara Pisa karena tidak ada yang merasa bertanggung jawab untuk membersihkan meja. Pelayanannya tampaknya tidak mampu menangani tamu. Pemandangan seperti ini terjadi setiap hari, bukan seperti yang kita harapkan dari resor bintang 5. Pengalaman sehari-hari ini merusak awal hari kami, untungnya kami menyewa skuter untuk melarikan diri. Pilihan sarapan Asia sangat banyak, meskipun kesibukan yang tak tertahankan, ini bagus. Pilihan keju atau sosis iris agak memalukan untuk kategori *ini, pojok keju hanya menawarkan dua jenis keju cheddar, tetapi suatu hari kami menemukan *satu* potong camembert. Layanannya sangat lama untuk mengembalikan piring prasmanan yang kosong, setiap hari kami harus menunggu buah, sayuran, dll. yang baru dipotong atau meminta isi ulang secara khusus. Musik tekno latar belakang tidak benar-benar meredakan suasana yang menegangkan (kami berusia 30-an & masih merasa kesal - apakah begitu sulit menemukan musik lounge yang keren?) begitu pula dengan suara bising tamu-tamu Tiongkok yang sedang menonton film. - area kolam renang & pantai: propertinya luas dan bagus, tetapi tidak ada cukup kursi santai di sekitar area kolam renang, jadi kami berjuang setiap hari untuk menemukan tempat di bawah bayangan. Pada hari terakhir kami ada persiapan untuk pernikahan (ke-2 selama kami menginap) sementara persiapan pernikahan pertama tidak mengganggu kami, untuk pernikahan kedua, inaya menutup setengah pantai & seluruh taman. jika perjuangan belum cukup sulit untuk menemukan tempat, hari ini layanan juga memesan lebih dari setengah kursi pantai untuk tamu harian, jadi tamu hotel tidak dapat menggunakannya.. sejak kapan staf hotel memesan kursi?? Sangat mengganggu juga adalah tes super berisik dari band pernikahan selama berjam-jam di siang hari. Kami hanya mendapat catatan yang meminta maaf atas ketidaknyamanan, manajemen seharusnya mengundang semua tamu hotel untuk makan malam untuk siksaan ini! kami merasa seperti tamu kelas 2 di resor bintang 5 saat bulan madu kami, apa yang salah dengan manajemen? Layanan terlalu sibuk dengan persiapan, mereka tidak peduli untuk mengurus tamu hotel mereka sendiri seperti menerima pesanan minuman atau makanan. Meskipun baunya sepanjang hari tidak dapat diterima seperti bensin, sulit untuk menghirup udara segar. Untungnya bagi Inaya simbol-simbolnya terbatas. Kami tidak akan pernah kembali ke Inaya. Untungnya kami juga merasakan keramahtamahan masyarakat Bali yang sangat baik. Inaya tidak termasuk di antaranya."

Makan malam itu gratis untuk tipe kamar yang kami tempati, dan kami menambahkan dan membayar untuk 7 orang ke paket gratis 10 orang. Kami meminta meja untuk grup dan telah dikonfirmasi oleh petugas di reservasi restoran, dan diminta untuk datang pukul 8 malam, yang awalnya kami minta pukul 7 malam melalui formulir reservasi Google mereka. Ketika kami datang, tidak ada meja yang disiapkan untuk grup kami. Akhirnya kami harus duduk terpisah. Makanannya tidak berkualitas baik. Dan pelayan terus bertanya apakah kami sudah membayar untuk orang tambahan. Tahun baru terburuk yang pernah ada."

"823.","Manuel Garcia","16","2020-01-20","1","Hotel ini diberi peringkat bintang 5, tapi menurut saya tidak pantas mendapatkan peringkat itu. Proses check-in sangat lambat, dan mereka tidak mau membantu jika Anda tidak fasih berbahasa Inggris. Kamarnya tua dan perlu direnovasi, termasuk furniturnya yang sudah cukup usang. Seprai dan handuknya mengecewakan; usang dan tidak dicuci dengan baik. Lebih baik bawa saja dari rumah. Di hotel bintang 5, antrean untuk sarapan sudah ada sejak pertama kali saya melihatnya, tapi antreannya panjang sekali. Kualitas makanannya biasa saja dan harganya buruk. Satu-satunya hal yang bagus adalah kamarnya memiliki akses ke kolam renang, tapi tentu saja harus bayar. Resor ini memang all-inclusive, tapi harus bayar. Pilihan yang buruk. Lebih dari sekadar pengalaman menginap di hotel bintang 5, saya harus komplain pukul 15.00 agar kamar dibersihkan. Tiga hari kemudian, seprai belum diganti. Antrean untuk sarapan masih berlanjut. Saya tidak mengerti bagaimana mereka bisa mendapatkan ulasan positif seperti itu dan hasil pengecatannya 4,6. Anda harus teliti dan berpengetahuan."

Rasanya mereka memberikan layanan tanpa mengambil uang. Kami berpikir untuk mengganti hotelnya sendiri, tetapi karena ketentuan pembatalan mereka, kami terpaksa tetap menginap.

Tempat tidurnya berukuran king sesuai dengan pemesanan, tetapi ternyata berbeda dari yang dipesan, dan upaya untuk memperbaikinya justru memperburuk keadaan. Kamarnya penuh serangga, kamar mandinya berbau, dan bak mandinya tersumbat. Menginap di sana tidak sepadan dengan uang yang dibayarkan, dan manajernya hanya mencari-cari alasan dan tidak mencari solusi yang tepat. Berbicara dengannya hanya membuang-buang waktu.

Kami memesan 3 kamar, dan harus menunggu 2 jam untuk mendapatkan setidaknya 1 kamar yang tersedia. Staf check-in sama sekali tidak ramah/membantu, meskipun kami sedang mengandung bayi dan istri saya sedang tidak enak badan. Selain itu, suhu kamar diatur pada 28 derajat ketika kami memasuki kamar, dan AC membutuhkan waktu berjam-jam untuk mendinginkan ruangan. Kunjungan pertama dan terakhir di sini...."
"830.","Usa Stuff","1","2019-01-20","1","Proses check-in lancar dan mereka melayani saya setelah menunggu sebentar. Karena saya memesan Ocean View Suite, saya diberi Butler pribadi dan harus menunggu beberapa menit sampai dia tiba. Proses check-in dan pembayaran dilakukan di kamar saya, yang saya sukai. Sayangnya, semuanya memburuk setelah itu. Karena saat itu sedang minggu IMF dan perusahaan kami juga sedang mengadakan pertemuan puncak di sana, saya dikenakan biaya sekitar 50% premi untuk kamar - jadi, alih-alih sekitar £400 untuk 2 malam, saya dikenakan biaya sekitar £670 (13 juta Rupiah). Untuk harga segitu, saya mengharapkan layanan bintang 5 kelas dunia. Saya sangat kecewa. Kamarnya sangat luas, dekorasinya lumayan - beberapa perlengkapan agak usang dan ada beberapa retakan di furnitur. Kebersihannya kurang baik dan ada debu putih di bawah wastafel tempat handuk saya disimpan, serta beberapa debu/sarang laba-laba di sudut ruang duduk. Hal yang paling mengganggu adalah kotak berisi cokelat gratis. Setelah diperiksa, ternyata penuh serangga kecil dan saya harus memesannya ulang dan secara khusus meminta agar sepatu saya ditutup. Layanan cuci sepatu gratis juga tersedia di kamar, jadi saya meminta sepatu olahraga saya dibersihkan. Mereka menolak dan mengatakan sepatu harus terbuat dari bahan kulit, tetapi mereka bisa mencucinya dengan biaya tambahan! Saya merasa hal ini tidak dapat diterima dengan harga yang saya bayar. Mereka juga menawarkan teh sore gratis. Saya meminta teh sore tersebut diantar ke kamar saya, tetapi mereka menolak lagi dengan alasan saya hanya bisa menikmatinya di restoran. Sekali lagi, layanan yang tidak dapat diterima untuk akomodasi semahal itu. Apa gunanya membayar pelayan pribadi? Ketika saya datang ke restoran untuk menerima teh sore, awalnya saya diberitahu bahwa mereka sudah tutup dan tidak tersedia meskipun masih ada beberapa menit tersisa untuk layanan resmi. Ketika saya menanyakan hal ini, mereka mengatakan mereka akan tetap menyediakan layanan seperti yang diiklankan. Sayangnya, ketika menu makanan tiba, mereka membelinya di atas stan kue yang sangat kotor. Jelas sudah lama tidak dicuci dan ada serangga kecil merayap di celah-celah kayu yang juga penuh dengan kotoran dan remah-remah. Scone-nya basi dan saya tidak mungkin memakannya karena saya tidak percaya standar kebersihan mereka. Mereka menawarkan untuk membawa yang baru, tetapi saat itu saya tidak percaya bahwa scone kedua lebih baik, jadi saya pergi. Saya menjelaskan segudang kekecewaan saya kepada manajer jaga dan manajer restoran. Mereka kembali menawarkan teh sore dan pijat gratis. Saya menolak dengan mengatakan itu tidak cukup baik dan nilai kompensasi mereka tidak akan cukup untuk menutupi kekurangan mereka. Saya bilang saya ingin diskon tagihan saya (atau lebih tepatnya pengembalian dana karena saya sudah membayar di muka) atau menginap gratis di lain waktu karena saya harus segera pergi. Mereka juga menolak permintaan ini. Secara keseluruhan, saya merasa benar-benar ditipu. Mereka tidak malu memberikan layanan di bawah standar sambil meminta bayaran yang sangat tinggi. Uang sebanyak ini di Indonesia seharusnya menjamin Anda mendapatkan yang terbaik dari yang terbaik. Sayangnya, Inaya Putri bukanlah tempat yang tepat untuk menghabiskan uang hasil jerih payah Anda. Pergilah ke tempat lain untuk mendapatkan layanan yang lebih baik. Saya pasti akan memberi tahu tim untuk mengadakan pertemuan puncak di tempat lain tahun depan. Hotel itu sepertinya tidak tertarik untuk kehilangan pelanggan! Saya punya bukti video dari semua hal buruk yang saya alami, jadi saya akan mengunggahnya jika memungkinkan. Saya akan memberi kabar terbaru jika mereka kembali dan melakukan hal yang benar, mengembalikan uang saya, atau menawarkan kompensasi yang setara. Pilihlah dengan bijak, teman-teman - ada banyak tempat yang jauh lebih baik dengan harga yang jauh lebih murah di luar sana!"
"831.","Jenny","7","2023-01-20","1","Dengan harga segitu, ini salah satu hotel terburuk yang pernah saya tinggali. Seharusnya ini hotel bintang 5. Manajemennya sangat buruk. Stafnya kurang terlatih. Makanannya sangat mahal dan tidak konsisten. Ada hari yang bagus, ada hari yang buruk. Kami tidak akan menginap di sini lagi."
"832.","랜드스페이스 LANDSPACE","48","2021-01-20","1","Saya memesan kamar dengan terburu-buru, tetapi saya terkejut betapa mewah dan mewahnya kamar itu untuk harganya. Kolam renangnya bagus, dengan kolam selam dan berbagai pilihan lainnya, dan bahkan memiliki pantai pribadi. Tentu saja, air lautnya agak sulit untuk masuk dan bermain karena puing-puing yang mengambang. Saya kebanyakan bermain di kolam renang. Sarapannya tidak buruk, dengan beragam pilihan yang baik, tetapi agak mengecewakan karena ada makanan India, Cina, dan Jepang, tetapi tidak ada makanan Korea. Berdasarkan ini, seharusnya setidaknya 4 bintang, tetapi pancuran di kamar kami tidak mengalir, jadi kami menghubungi resepsionis. Dua teknisi masuk ke kamar dengan mengenakan sepatu kerja, memeriksa pancuran, meninggalkan jejak sepatu basah, dan memberi tahu kami bahwa kami perlu pindah kamar. Kami telah bepergian selama beberapa hari, jadi semua cucian dan barang bawaan kami dibongkar, jadi kami agak kesal diminta pindah kamar di tengah malam. Staf resepsionis bahkan tidak meminta maaf dan bilang akan pindah kamar seolah-olah itu sudah rutinitas, yang benar-benar membuat kami kesal. Ngomong-ngomong, kamar mandinya kurang nyaman karena airnya tidak mengalir, jadi saya mengemasi tas lagi sekitar jam 10 malam dan pindah kamar~~~ Tapi, sepertinya mereka langsung membersihkan kamar yang mereka pindahkan, karena air di bak mandi tidak mengalir dan bau pembersihnya sangat menyengat~ Saya menelepon lagi untuk komplain, tapi susah pindah kamar lagi, jadi saya tinggal mengikat mereka~ Saya beri 1 bintang untuk tindakan mereka."
"833.","Ángela Martín","6","2018-01-20","1","Salah satu pengalaman terburuk dalam hidup saya. Hotel ini pantas bintangnya dicabut. Check-in lambat tanpa informasi pemesanan (hampir satu jam karena mereka tidak memiliki informasi kami, kami bahkan harus memberi tahu mereka tentang ketentuan pemesanan kami). Kondisi hotel buruk, kamar kotor, JEJAK KAKI HITAM di seluruh kamar mandi, NODA misterius di sofa (di mana-mana, mereka mencoba meyakinkan kami bahwa itu adalah pola pada pelapis... noda dan lebih banyak lagi noda putih, noda makanan, singkatnya, sesuatu yang menjijikkan di mana kebersihannya sangat mencolok), bak mandi tertutup debu, dinding dan furnitur seolah-olah ada hewan liar di dalam kamar. Semua ini mewakili hotel bintang 5. Pengalaman itu semakin buruk ketika kami mengeluh. Mereka menawari kami perubahan kamar (dengan dua tempat tidur terpisah... kami sudah membayar untuk kamar king). Kami setuju untuk perubahan itu karena tidak terbayangkan hotel bintang 5 bisa memiliki kebersihan seperti ini, dan yang terburuk pun terjadi... Kamar kedua LEBIH BURUK!!!!!!!!! Nodanya makin banyak, bak mandi belum dicuci (noda lumpur hitam), sofa bernoda, dan makin banyak noda. Sejak jam 8 pagi, kami mulai mendengar teriakan orang Tionghoa, pintu dibanting, anak-anak menjerit... tidur jadi susah... Kamar mandi di tepi kolam renang terasa seperti tempat pembuangan sampah. Kamar mandi di warung jelek mana pun di Bali lebih bersih. Kebersihannya kurang. Kualitas makanan di restoran benar-benar buruk... mereka bahkan tidak bisa membuat sayuran panggang. Benar-benar buruk. Keesokan paginya semuanya sama saja. Mereka mencoba meminta maaf dengan sabun (benar) dan tidak memberi kami kompensasi finansial. Kami pun pergi. JANGAN pergi ke hotel ini. Mereka seharusnya menghapus kategori hotelnya. Kebersihan seharusnya standar, dan tidak ada di sini. Saya punya foto yang membuktikan pengalaman itu. TANPA BINTANG"

Mengetahui saya akan menginap dengan putri saya, staf FO langsung berkata tolong jaga anak Anda karena pihak hotel tidak bertanggung jawab jika terjadi apa-apa (dengan ekspresi tidak simpatik). Tidak semua staf mengucapkan salam seperti hotel lain di area ITDC. Saya meminta tas sanitasi, staf menjawab kami tidak berjanji dan coba cari dulu. Hotel bintang 5 macam apa ini? Itu hanya kantong plastik biasa dan Anda dapat dengan mudah menemukannya di mana-mana. Kamarnya cukup standar (standar bintang 5), airnya kuning saat pertama kali menyalakan keran, kolam renangnya tidak terlalu istimewa. Tapi ini harus ditanggung jika merusaka memiliki layanan yang baik. Yang pasti, ini terakhir kalinya saya menginap di merusaka. Sebagai milik BUMN, sayang sekali mengetahui negara saya memiliki hotel bintang 5 dengan layanan seperti ini kepada warga negara Indonesia. Sekadar informasi, masih banyak hotel bintang 5 lain di kawasan ITDC yang lebih menghargai tamu (dan mereka adalah hotel jaringan internasional)"

Kami belum pernah diperlakukan seburuk ini di hotel sebelumnya. Itu bulan madu kami dan tidak ada yang peduli sama sekali karena Anda hanyalah nomor kamar dan tidak berarti apa-apa lagi bagi kru hotel. Contohnya: Kami memiliki keluarga Ghekko yang duduk di luar di bawah atap Villa kami dan membuat suara keras sepanjang malam. Jadi kami menelepon resepsionis untuk mengurus mereka. 30 menit berikutnya tidak terjadi apa-apa. Jadi kami menelepon lagi dan menunggu 30 menit lagi... tidak ada yang terjadi. Keesokan harinya kami pergi ke resepsionis dan memberi tahu mereka tentang masalah tersebut. Mereka menyuruh kami menelepon ketika kami mendengar suara ghekko. Jadi kami menelepon lagi malam itu dan akhirnya mereka mengirim seorang pria yang tidak bisa berbahasa Inggris. Dia hanya menangkap satu ghekko kecil dan pergi. Terlambat 15 menit kami menelepon lagi karena suara ghekko yang keras dan mereka mengatakan kepada kami itu sudah biasa, itu normal. Jadi kami tidak bisa tidur selama 7 hari lagi sampai sekarang dan kami senang meninggalkan hotel itu! Saat check-out, mereka bahkan tidak bertanya tentang pengalaman menginap kami di Merusaka - karena mereka memang tidak peduli. Kami tidak akan mengunjungi Merusaka Nusa Dua lagi dan kami juga tidak akan merekomendasikan hotel ini kepada siapa pun."

Keesokan harinya, 26/01/18, kami dipindahkan ke kamar lain karena kamar sebelumnya berbau jamur. Jadi, barang bawaan kami dipindahkan oleh petugas keamanan dan staf. Sekitar pukul 15.30 hari itu, kami pergi ke kolam renang untuk berenang dan kembali sekitar pukul 18.00. Saya tidak menyadari ada perhiasan yang hilang karena berada di tas jinjing saya, tempat saya meninggalkannya terakhir kali, dan saya tidak membutuhkannya saat itu. Keesokan harinya, 27/01/18, kami akan makan malam dan saya pergi untuk mengambil perhiasan saya. Ketika saya membuka tas jinjing saya, tidak ada perhiasan di sana; semua perhiasan saya dicuri dari tas saya, semuanya berada di dalam tas kecil berwarna hitam. Saya melaporkan hal ini kepada manajer yang bertugas, yang kemudian memulai penyelidikan tentang siapa yang masuk ke kamar saya. Saya diperlihatkan rekaman CCTV pada pukul 17.07 tanggal 26/01, dua staf pria masuk ke kamar untuk memberikan air dan segera keluar dari kamar. Saya sangat yakin perhiasan saya diambil dari tas jinjing saya oleh staf tersebut. Keesokan harinya saya pergi ke kantor polisi setempat untuk membuat laporan. Para petugas sama sekali tidak membantu, sangat kasar, dan tidak menunjukkan belas kasihan atas apa yang terjadi. Saya tidak akan pernah menginap di resor ini lagi, ini sangat tidak profesional dan fakta bahwa seseorang telah menggeledah koper saya dan mencuri barang-barang saya sangat mengerikan.

"890.","imelda pramita","87","2024-01-20","2","Cukup kecewa memilih hotel ini untuk pengalaman nyepi pertama saya. Pesan garden suites room include dinner untuk 3 hari 2 malam, saya kira akan mendapatkan pengalaman yang menyenangkan dan ketenangan, ternyata tidak. Waktu check in tidak begitu lama di resepsionis, namun ketika menunggu diantar oleh petugas hotel ke kamar, harus menunggu hingga 1 jam! Saya sampai harus datang 2 kali ke meja resepsionis, ternyata luggage tag saya hanya ditaruh begitu saja di meja. Kamar suitesnya cukup luas, aminities nya cukup lengkap, hanya saja karena dekat dengan storage room, jadi sangat berisik dengan petugas hotel yang menggeser/memindahkan barang. Hari pertama sudah menyampaikan ke pihak hotel bahwa hal itu cukup menggangu dan mereka berjanji bahwa tidak akan ada lagi suara, nyatanya hari kedua masih sama saja berisik, sampai pukul 01.30 pagi! Selama 2 hari saya tidak bisa tidur dengan nyenyak. Untuk sarapannya biasa saja, makanan indonesianya cenderung asin. Pesan tom yum goong di resto, hanya berisi udang kecil 5 buah, beberapa jamur, serai dan tomat. Makan malam paket nyepi, harus menunggu antrian sampai 1 jam! Sistemnya buffet, makanannya so so. The funny thing, tidak include minum! Jadi harus beli terpisah, bahkan untuk sekedar air putih. Ada private beach samping hotel, cuma tidak begitu bersih, ada sampah plastik, botol dan kayu di pinggir pantainya. Kemudian petugas hotel menawarkan untuk membawakan luggage dari kamar ketika check out, sebagai permintaan maaf karena butuh waktu lama, ketika check in. Ternyata sewaktu saya ke concierge setelah ke pantai, luggage saya masih di kamar dan harus menunggu lagi selama satu jam lebih! Kali kedua saya ke concierge, baru barang saya diambil dari kamar. Ini jadi pengalaman pertama dan terakhir saya stay di sini. Akan merekomendasikan? No, I wouldn't."
"891.","Dududu Lalala","20","2024-01-20","2","Room sangat baik. Hotel bersih dan nyaman. Staff sangat baik. View juara. Tetapi sangat di sayangkan, pada saat menginap dengan paket nyepi. Dinner tidak dapat minum, hanya aditional berbayar. Saya rasa dengn rate 480k/person untuk dinner, dengan makanan yang tidak begitu banyak pilihan. Saya rasa Kurang worth it Sangat mengecewakan. Logika deh, mana ada orang dinner berfikir untuk membawa minuman dari kamar. Saya rasa hotel harus mengubah kebijakan ini, demi kenyamanan tamu. Hanya sekedar menyediakan minum, bukan hal yang berat. Bahkan air putih pun tidak di sediakan, dan berbayar. Sangat konyol. Diluar itu semuanya sangat pantas dengan bintang 5. Tetapi dinner mengecewakan."

Saya ambil kamar suite dengan harga 2kali harga kamar biasa dengan harapan mendapatkan fasilitas dan suasana yg nyaman. Awalnya saya merasa kagum dengan pemandangannya terutama pemandangan dari lantai 4. Laut lepas sangat indah. Namun air panas tidak jalan (berhasil diperbaiki namun menyita waktu kami dan air panas menjadi sangat panas tidak dapat diatur suhunya, menu sarapan biasa saja cenderung kurang enak, pantai kotor banyak sampah, taman mereka kotor banyak sampah bekas makanan, fasilitas harus membayar bahkan hanya untuk pinjam sepedah. Sangat kecewa. Pedahal sebelumnya saya sempat menginap di hotel lain, di kawasan yang sama dengan harga yang 50% lebih murah. Tapi pelayanan dan fasilitas jauh sekali. Bahkan kebersihannya pun jauh sekali. Untuk kamar suite merusaka luas dan nyaman saya akui. Bersih. Pemandangan indah. Kurang cocok jika membawa anak anak karena kegiatan di hotel kurang menarik untuk anak anak. Besar harapan saya, Merusaka sebagai hotel milik BUMN Indonesia segalanya bisa segera di tingkatkan.

Akhirnya saya tunggu di kamar sepupu karena katanya hanya perlu double check 15 menit dan kunci akan diantar ke kamar sepupu. Setelah 15 menit tidak diantar, saya telp 2x ke receptionist belum siap juga. FYI tamu check-out jam 12, diperbolehkan chech-in jam 3 sore, 3 jam apa tidak cukup untuk beres2 kamar & double check? Setelah mendatangi receptionist ke2 kalinya akhirnya dapat kunci jam 6 kurang. Tidak berhenti sampai disitu, kamar sepupu ada lebah sampai belasan ekor.

"903.","Yijun Gu","9","2025-12-23","2","Pengalaman menginap yang sangat mengecewakan, tidak direkomendasikan! Ini adalah salah satu pengalaman hotel paling membuat frustrasi yang pernah saya alami. Kami memesan kamar dengan tempat tidur king untuk beberapa malam, tetapi saat tiba, hotel mencoba menyediakan dua tempat tidur single yang digabungkan dan menampilkannya sebagai tempat tidur king. Bahkan setelah menyampaikan masalah ini dan mengganti kamar, masalah yang sama persis terjadi lagi. Ini tidak dapat diterima dan tidak sesuai dengan tipe kamar yang kami pesan. Kamar pertama terletak di ujung koridor panjang, di sebelah kolam renang kecil yang kurang terawat. Begitu kami masuk, ada bau kimia dan renovasi yang menyengat, membuat kamar tidak layak huni. Kami meminta pergantian kamar dan harus menunggu lama di lobi sebelum ada pengaturan. Lobi dan area umum panas, lembap, dan tidak ber-AC, yang membuat waktu menunggu yang lama sangat tidak nyaman. Staf menyebutkan bahwa seseorang akan menghubungi kami melalui WhatsApp, tetapi tidak ada komunikasi yang pernah datang, bahkan selama seluruh masa menginap. Kamar kedua memiliki aroma buatan yang sangat menyengat, tampaknya digunakan untuk menutupi masalah yang mendasarinya. Bau yang menyengat menyebabkan iritasi hidung yang signifikan dan reaksi alergi keesokan paginya. Sekali lagi, tata letak tempat tidur tidak tepat, dengan dua tempat tidur single yang digabungkan alih-alih tempat tidur king size yang seharusnya. Meskipun hotel mengakui bahwa masalah ini adalah tanggung jawab mereka, mereka tetap menolak untuk memberikan pengembalian dana penuh. Yang terjadi selanjutnya adalah komunikasi yang panjang dan melelahkan yang melibatkan staf hotel dan agen pemesanan, dengan penjelasan yang tidak konsisten dan kurangnya profesionalisme. Selain itu, tata letak resor terasa lebih seperti kompleks apartemen tua daripada resor mewah. Kamar-kamar tersebar jauh dari lobi dan membutuhkan transportasi antar-jemput, yang menambah ketidaknyamanan yang tidak perlu. Secara keseluruhan, layanan, kualitas kamar, fasilitas, dan manajemen jauh di bawah ekspektasi untuk hotel kategori ini. Properti ini dikelola dengan buruk dan tidak memberikan pengalaman yang dijanjikan. Jika Anda peduli dengan kenyamanan, kesehatan, dan pengalaman perjalanan yang lancar, saya sangat menyarankan untuk mencari tempat lain."
"904.","Michael S.","35","2025-11-20","2","Saya terkejut dengan semua ulasan positif. Hotel ini sama sekali tidak menunjukkan atau memenuhi standar resor mewah. Karena saya harus menyebutkan begitu banyak hal negatif, saya hanya akan mencatat yang paling penting. Area kolam renang dan area sarapan benar-benar seperti medan perang—menjijikkan dan jelek, dan tidak menjamin liburan tenang yang Anda inginkan. Di area sarapan, Anda mungkin hanya bisa menghabiskan 15% dari makanan yang disajikan tanpa merasa mual. ​​AC kamar berfungsi, tetapi hampir tidak berfungsi—dan baunya sangat menyengat—itulah sebabnya mereka menyemprot kamar dengan parfum untuk menyembunyikannya. Saya ingin menekankan bahwa saya bisa mengerti bahwa bagi banyak orang—tingkat kualitas dan layanan ini dapat diterima atau bahkan baik. Tetapi jika Anda benar-benar pernah mengunjungi resor mewah atau resor kelas menengah—Anda akan sangat kecewa. Jangan berharap bisa bertahan lebih dari 3 hari di sini. Saya sarankan untuk memesan hanya 2 malam dan putuskan sendiri. Bagi kami—jika dilihat dari nilai uang—kami akan mengatakan harga hotel ini cukup terjangkau, sekitar $70 dolar AS untuk apa yang ditawarkannya. Anda bisa mendapatkan tempat yang jauh lebih baik dengan harga 100-140$ di Westin, Pantai Nusa Dua, dsb. Ajak pacar Anda ke sini hanya jika dia belum pernah ke resor yang bagus - jika tidak, hindari."
"905.","Prahitha Pendem","38","2025-12-20","2","Mereka memiliki pantai yang indah tetapi pelayanannya kurang baik. Respons sangat lambat ketika membutuhkan bantuan. Keramahtamahan dapat ditingkatkan. Untuk kamar dengan akses kolam renang, kolam renang dapat dirawat dengan lebih baik."
"906.","Zarathustra Huang","12","2025-12-30","2","Pengalaman hotel terburuk dalam hidup saya. Saya telah menginap di banyak negara dan kota di seluruh dunia, dan dengan harga sekitar AUD 300 per malam, ini tanpa diragukan lagi adalah hotel terburuk yang pernah saya tempati. Tidak ada pengecualian. Kami memesan kamar dengan tempat tidur king untuk empat malam. Saat tiba, hotel mencoba memberi kami dua tempat tidur single yang digabungkan dan mencoba menipu kami dengan mengatakan itu adalah tempat tidur king. Ini benar-benar tidak dapat diterima dan bukan yang kami pesan atau bayar. Kamar pertama yang mereka tunjukkan kepada kami terletak di ujung koridor yang panjang, tepat di sebelah kolam renang kecil dan kotor yang jelas tidak digunakan siapa pun. Kamar itu dipenuhi dengan bau renovasi dan bahan kimia yang menyengat sehingga tidak mungkin untuk menginap. Setelah kami mengeluh, mereka menawarkan kamar lain, tetapi hanya setelah memaksa kami menunggu lebih dari dua jam di lobi. Lobi sangat panas, tanpa AC, dalam cuaca hampir 30 derajat Celcius. Ketika kami akhirnya memasuki kamar kedua, kamar itu dipenuhi dengan bau parfum buatan yang sangat menyengat, jelas digunakan untuk menutupi sesuatu. Keesokan paginya, hidung saya sangat iritasi dan memicu reaksi alergi. Lebih buruk lagi, yang disebut tempat tidur king di kamar ini sekali lagi hanya dua tempat tidur kecil yang disatukan. Pihak hotel secara terbuka mengakui bahwa situasi ini adalah kesalahan mereka, namun tetap menolak untuk memberikan pengembalian dana. Yang terjadi selanjutnya adalah berjam-jam waktu terbuang, kontradiksi yang tak berujung, dan argumen bolak-balik antara staf hotel dan agen pemesanan. Penanganan situasi ini benar-benar tidak profesional dan melelahkan. Pelayanan yang buruk, kamar yang buruk, dan fasilitas yang buruk. Hotel ini sangat mahal dan dikelola dengan sangat buruk. Jika Anda menghargai waktu, kesehatan, atau uang Anda, lebih baik jangan menginap di sini. Tanggapan terhadap balasan hotel: Tanggapan ini dengan sempurna menunjukkan masalahnya — pengalihan tanggung jawab alih-alih akuntabilitas. Pertama, bersembunyi di balik jenis tempat tidur tergantung ketersediaan tidak membenarkan penjualan kamar dengan tempat tidur king dengan harga premium dan berulang kali menawarkan dua tempat tidur single yang disatukan. Menyebutnya sebagai “Hollywood Double” atau “Super King” tidak mengubah fakta bahwa itu bukanlah tempat tidur king sungguhan, dan banyak tamu — termasuk kami — secara tegas tidak menerima pengaturan ini. Mengganti nama masalah tidak akan menyelesaikannya. Kedua, apakah beberapa orang lebih menyukai pengaturan ini sama sekali tidak relevan. Kami tidak menyukainya, dan kami telah menjelaskannya sejak awal. Untuk hotel dengan kisaran harga ini, hal ini seharusnya tidak pernah menjadi perdebatan. Ketiga, masalahnya bukan hanya tempat tidur. Anda dengan mudah mengabaikan fakta bahwa kamar pertama memiliki bau renovasi/kimia yang kuat, dan kamar kedua memiliki aroma buatan yang terlalu menyengat yang menyebabkan reaksi alergi fisik. Menggunakan pengharum ruangan yang kuat sebagai “praktik standar” bukanlah alasan ketika hal itu secara langsung memengaruhi kesehatan tamu. Menyegarkan ruangan seharusnya tidak berarti membuatnya tidak dapat dihirup. Keempat, menyalahkan cuaca Bali atas lobi yang sangat panas tanpa pendingin udara terus terang tidak dapat diterima. Banyak hotel di Bali berhasil menyediakan area publik yang berpendingin. Tamu yang menunggu lebih dari dua jam dalam kondisi tidak nyaman adalah kegagalan layanan, bukan masalah iklim. Akhirnya, pihak hotel mengakui di tempat bahwa ini adalah masalah dari pihak hotel, namun tetap menolak untuk memberikan pengembalian dana yang adil. Ini bukan soal kewajiban — ini soal tanggung jawab dan profesionalisme dasar. Tanggapan ini hanya memperkuat ulasan awal saya. Masalahnya bukan hanya kamar atau fasilitasnya, tetapi juga sikapnya: acuh tak acuh, defensif, dan tidak mau bertanggung jawab. Saya tetap pada setiap kata dalam ulasan saya."
"907.","Matthew Nadell","11","2025-11-20","2","Kami menginap di sini selama 4 malam untuk bulan madu kami. Sejak check-in, kami merasa seperti hantu di hotel. Tidak ada seorang pun yang mengucapkan selamat bulan madu, mencoba memberi kami peningkatan apa pun, dan menempatkan kami di bagian PALING belakang hotel dengan jarak tempuh terjauh yang memungkinkan. Bangunan hotel semakin memburuk dan secara keseluruhan hotel ini maksimal hanya bintang 3. Makanan di restoran hotel tidak enak, mahal, dan sangat mengecewakan. Sopir kami menyebutkan bahwa kawasan Nusa Dua dikenal dengan hotel-hotel kelas atas yang membuat masa inap kami semakin frustrasi. Pakaian kami berbau seperti jamur dari kamar. Waspadalah terhadap ruang terbuka apa pun, termasuk area pantai dan kolam renang bagi perokok berat yang membuat tempat itu bau dan menghilangkan udara segar. TIDAK direkomendasikan."
"908.","Lodovica Colantoni","1","2025-12-20","2","Lokasinya menakjubkan tetapi ada beberapa masalah besar: 1. Jam operasional restoran yang terlalu ketat dan tanpa pemberitahuan sebelumnya. Kami pergi makan malam pukul 8 malam dan mereka bahkan tidak mengizinkan kami mengambil sebotol air. 2. Pelayanan yang sangat buruk yang merusak liburan kami! DAN TIDAK SATU PUN KARYAWAN YANG BERBICARA BAHASA INGGRIS. Di akhir masa menginap kami, kami lupa sebuah foto sepanjang sekitar 1 meter di tempat tidur kami dan kami meminta karyawan untuk memeriksanya, sambil menunjukkan juga foto objek dan letaknya. Kami memiliki foto yang mendokumentasikannya, foto itu ada di sana dan tidak diambil sebelum kami pergi dan saya tidak tahu apakah mereka tidak ingin menghabiskan waktu untuk memeriksa (yang sebenarnya merupakan bagian dari pekerjaan mereka) atau mereka merusak/mengambilnya saat merapikan tempat tidur. Kami harus menunggu berjam-jam untuk mendapatkan jawaban, bertanya setiap menit. Mereka kehilangan foto itu. Namun yang sangat memalukan adalah kami harus menghabiskan lebih dari satu jam untuk menjelaskan masalah kami, karena tidak satu pun karyawan mereka (bahkan yang bekerja di layanan pelanggan) yang bisa berbahasa Inggris. Maaf, tapi itu sama sekali bukan yang saya harapkan dari resor bintang 5."

Masalahnya, ketika kami tiba lebih awal di hari pertama, kami meminta agar pihak transfer menjemput kami di hari terakhir pukul 14.30, apakah mereka bisa memberi kami satu dari dua kamar tersebut dengan tambahan satu jam untuk mandi. Mereka meminta kami untuk membicarakannya di malam terakhir. Saya rasa mereka belum pernah mengisi semua kamar di area saya sebelum waktu itu atau di hari lainnya. Nah, dengan senyum lebar, mereka memberi tahu kami bahwa mereka harus mengurusnya dan itu tidak boleh. KELASNYA BURUK, kalau bisa."

Mereka tidak dapat memberikan konfirmasi karena mereka membutuhkan waktu 14 hari untuk merespons. Akun saya dipotong lebih dari $400 meskipun saya telah menghabiskan $200. Lebih baik makan di luar. Belum pernah melihat pelayanan seburuk itu. Hal yang sama terjadi di prasmanan pagi, setiap hari dan Anda menunggu yang terasa seperti satu jam untuk mendapatkan kopi atau teh tetapi piring-piring dibersihkan dalam 2 detik. Roti itu dari kemarin! Dan tidak segar. Pantai terlihat bagus dari kejauhan tetapi begitu Anda sampai di sana, Anda melihat betapa kotor dan penuh sampahnya. Kolam renang kotor dan, yang terpenting, orang-orang membiarkan orang lain makan dan merokok di kolam renang."

Pantai yang dapat diakses dari hotel adalah tempat pembuangan sampah, penuh dengan plastik. Lebih jauh lagi, agen perjalanan yang memesan perjalanan kami memesan satu malam tambahan untuk kami sehingga kami dapat menikmati hotel di hari terakhir kami. Kami meminta hotel untuk memberi kami kompensasi berupa makanan ringan atau koktail karena kami mengosongkan tiga kamar pada pukul 17.30 hari sebelumnya dan tidak menggunakan sarapan. Kami tidak hanya tidak menerima kompensasi sama sekali, tetapi cara mereka menanganinya juga sangat tidak pantas. Benar-benar mengecewakan."

Selama saya menginap di hotel-hotel ternama, belum pernah mereka meminta kartu identitas pasangan dan anak-anak saya? Saya sudah mendapatkan kamar, dan ternyata bidetnya rusak dan harus diganti. Speaker TV-nya juga rusak, suaranya buruk sekali (kasar dan sebagainya). Untuk hotel dengan harga dan lokasi seperti ini di Nusa Dua, saya berharap lebih.

Lokasi resort sangat nyaman, namun jujur ​​saja, stafnya kurang ramah… mereka tidak memberikan banyak informasi secara transparan, terutama dari perspektif pemesanan. Ternyata anak tersebut bukan bagian dari keluarga dan hanya dua orang dewasa yang dianggap sebagai tamu… sisanya dikenakan biaya. Staf lebih tertarik untuk menyelesaikan tagihan bahkan sebelum anak Anda sarapan (mengejutkan, bukan?). Bahkan pilihan dan kualitas makanannya pun tidak terlalu bagus. Mereka memang menyediakan layanan tambahan seperti pemesanan skuter, namun mereka tidak memberikan informasi yang benar di tempat dan Anda yang harus disalahkan. Ternyata, yang kami alami adalah jika Anda memesan skuter melalui mereka, harganya hampir 100.000 rupiah lebih tinggi dibandingkan dengan langsung berurusan dengan perusahaan penyewaan skuter. Menurut pengalaman kami, tempat ini terlalu dibesar-besarkan."
"916.","Deb Tan","161","2025-04-20","2","Hotel ini cukup mengecewakan dibandingkan dengan tempat lain yang kami menginap di Bali. Tidak ada yang benar-benar istimewa. Kami tiba 30 menit sebelum check-in dan diminta menunggu di restoran sampai kamar kami siap. Satu jam berlalu tanpa kabar terbaru, jadi kami harus menindaklanjutinya sendiri—hanya untuk mengetahui bahwa kamar sudah siap sejak lama. Mengingat cuaca panas dan lembap, kami hanya ingin segera pindah ke tempat yang lebih sejuk. Kami ragu memesan hotel ini karena jaraknya yang jauh dari area utama, dan meskipun lokasi Bali Collection yang dekat merupakan nilai tambah, tanpanya, Anda akan merasa terjebak di resor ini. Suasana keseluruhannya kurang nyaman, dan stafnya tidak sehangat atau seramah di tempat lain yang kami menginap. Menu restorannya agak mahal, jadi Anda mungkin ingin mencoba pilihan tempat makan lainnya. Kekurangan lainnya adalah kurangnya informasi yang diberikan—staf tidak pernah memberi tahu kami tentang aktivitas resor atau fasilitas yang tersedia. Kami harus mencari sendiri atau bertanya, yang membuat pengalaman menginap terasa kurang menarik. Karena itu, kami akhirnya hanya berdiam di kamar untuk tidur dan mandi. Sebagian besar waktu kami berada di luar hotel dan tidak pernah benar-benar merasakan apa yang ditawarkan resor, jika ada. Selain itu, Anda harus membayar ekstra untuk menyewa sepeda usang mereka, sekitar $6 per jam, saya rasa. Lol. Satu-satunya bagian yang lumayan adalah tepi pantai. Namun, tempat tidur di lounge kolam renang terbatas dibandingkan dengan jumlah tamu, jadi mencari tempat cukup sulit. Terakhir, sistem pembuangan dan pembuangan kotoran kamar sangat perlu dirawat—baunya tidak sedap selama kami menginap. Mungkin sebaiknya lewati hotel ini & pilih yang lain! :)"
"917.","Božul Bobková","42","2025-05-20","2","Hotel ini sangat berbeda, dan bukan dalam arti yang baik, dibandingkan dengan hotel-hotel lain yang pernah kami kunjungi di Bali. Hotel ini sedikit mengingatkan saya pada sebuah pabrik. Sarapannya sangat mengecewakan untuk hotel bintang 5 dan dibandingkan dengan hotel-hotel lain di Bali. Terlebih lagi, berbagai macam salami, ham, dan keju dibiarkan dalam keadaan hangat tanpa didinginkan sehingga warnanya hampir berubah menjadi hijau. Kami harus berhati-hati dalam memilih makanan agar tidak mengalami masalah perut. Restoran-restorannya terlalu mahal untuk kualitasnya, dan stafnya kurang ramah. Selain itu, saya tiba-tiba membutuhkan produk sanitasi wanita, saya meminta bantuan resepsionis pria. Dia memanggil seseorang dan bertanya, tetapi orang itu menjawab di telepon dengan cara yang arogan dan tertawa. Akhirnya dia merekomendasikan toko hotel mereka, tetapi saya merasa sangat tidak nyaman dalam situasi ini. Secara keseluruhan, mungkin ini satu-satunya kesalahan saya saat memesan hotel. Tidak direkomendasikan. Balasan untuk balasan manajer: Tidak, untuk banyak salami dan keju, sama sekali tidak ada es, semuanya dibiarkan di piring saji. Misalnya di stasiun daging babi. Atau di tengah ruangan, di satu sisi ada jus dan di sisi lain keju dan salami. Pendinginan disediakan misalnya untuk susu."

"919.","Ju Lia","18","2025-07-20","2","Kamar: Kamar kami memiliki akses langsung ke kolam renang. Perabotannya agak kuno dan sedikit berbau apak. Lemari pakaian kami tidak praktis, karena sebagian terbuka dan menawarkan ruang penyimpanan yang terlalu sedikit. !! Kami menemukan kutu kasur di kamar, yang menyebabkan saya gatal-gatal hebat, meninggalkan bekas merah dan kuning di kaki saya karena gatal-gatal tersebut. Meskipun demikian, tempat tidurnya sangat nyaman dan kamarnya sangat luas. Pelayanan: Staf restoran ramah dan memperhatikan semua permintaan, tetapi sayangnya, mereka tidak selalu membawakan barang yang Anda pesan. Namun demikian, secara umum kami merasa sangat disambut di restoran. Kami memesan paket all-inclusive, dan setiap kali memesan, kami harus menandatangani tagihan (yang gratis dengan paket all-inclusive). Ini terkadang membutuhkan waktu cukup lama, dari memesan hingga menerima tagihan, dan mungkin juga merupakan upaya untuk mendapatkan tip tambahan. Kami menghabiskan sejumlah uang yang relatif besar untuk tip selama menginap. Pada hari keberangkatan kami, kami dijadwalkan untuk dijemput pada larut malam. Kami diberitahu bahwa kami harus check-out sebelum pukul 12 siang, meskipun kami telah menanyakan di resepsionis beberapa hari sebelumnya tentang kemungkinan memperpanjang masa inap kami. Kami dip压 untuk segera memutuskan apakah akan membayar €150 untuk memperpanjang kamar kami sekitar 6 jam pada hari keberangkatan atau check-out pada pukul 12 siang. Sayangnya, kami tidak diberi informasi yang memadai bahwa ini hanya berlaku untuk kamar itu sendiri dan bahwa kami tidak berhak atas makanan tambahan apa pun. Ketika kami tiba di restoran sebelum penerbangan kami yang memakan waktu 23 jam, informasi yang salah ini menyebabkan situasi yang sangat tidak menyenangkan, dan kami diminta untuk pergi oleh staf. Kami meninggalkan Merusaka dengan perasaan tidak enak. :( Kami belum pernah mengalami hal seperti ini di negara lain... saat memesan paket all-inclusive, Anda selalu bisa makan dan minum sampai waktu keberangkatan. Membayar €150 hanya untuk mandi adalah harga yang sangat mahal, dan dengan informasi yang tepat dan waktu untuk mempertimbangkannya, kami mungkin akan membuat keputusan yang berbeda.
