"2.","Farros Zain","157","2025-12-09","4","Secara lokasi sangat strategis, tempatnya nyaman. Namun jangan checkin terlalu malam karena petugas sedikit dan harus cari kamar sendiri. Sarapan cukup oke, pemandangan sangat bagus di sini. Semoga bisa lebih berbenah saat ada acara besar"
"3.","Wachid Muslimin","61","2025-11-30","2","Stayed here for business, honestly this is not an appropriate place for meeting, seminar, or other similar activities. First, the place is quite outdoor, you will be exposed with rain and sun whenever you need to go to the toilets and restaurants (for lunch or dinner). Second, they serve you cold tea and coffee during the sessions. The issue I've experienced during my stay was the room's AC wasn't working, and they insisted to repair it until three times. Every time they claimed they have repaired it, I have to get back to my room to check it. What a waste of time during a business stay! After three times, they finally let me move to another room, and not even an upgrade. Truly a disappointment! I will never stay here, nor will I recommend this place to you."

"6.","Rizka S.P","76","2025-11-30","5","Check in malam dan hujan. Gelap dan sepi sekali, jarak antar kamarnya agak jauh. Pas pagi baru keliatan ternyata ga sesepi itu. Ruangan kamarnya klasik tapi di maintenance dengan baik. Bersih. Kalo keliling keliling lumayan juga, jauh. Cuma agak susah aja kalo bawa koper dj lantai 2 karena pakai tangga."
"7.","Andi","55","2025-08-30","5","Hotel yang cukup nyaman untuk berlibur, punya akses langsung ke pantai & tempat untuk sky. Kamar nyaman, sepi & halaman luas. Cocok untuk liburan bersama keluarga. Staff ramah-ramah & gerak cepat kalau diperlukan sesuatu. Ada fasilitas lapangan tenis & kolam renang. Bagi yang muslim juga disediakan mushola. Kekurangan: kamar mandi agak berbau & kamar model cotage sehingga agak sepi dan mungkin kurang cocok untuk yang penakut. Hotel punya lokasi yang cukup luas untuk acara-acara gathering atau pernikahan, sehingga di saat weekend mungkin akan sedikit ramai. Afak jauh masuk dari jalan raya. Tapi malah bagus karena suasana hotel jadi tenang"
"8.","Tia","1","2025-11-30","5","Saya sangat puas dengan pengalaman menginap di hotel ini. Suasananya mewah, pelayanan sangat profesional, dan setiap detail terasa berkelas. Kebersihan dan kenyamanan benar-benar terjaga dengan baik. Staf ramah, cepat membantu, dan memberikan pelayanan yang membuat tamu merasa dihargai. Pengalaman menginap yang sempurna dan sangat direkomendasikan."

"11.","U B71","59","2025-09-30","4","This property is just a few steps away from the harbour. So it's easy to just walk down to the resort if one is taking the Ekajaya boat service from Padang Bai or Gili islands. But the few negatives - *the breakfast is below average.Spread is not good & food does not get refilled. The fruit & salad trays are rarely full. *The bathrooms need cleaning & flush does not work properly. *There is no travel desk to help tourists. *Major area of the resort was occupied by firstly preparation for a wedding party & then loud party. This went on for all the 3 days we stayed...very annoying indeed. * There is no Spa in the resort. It is only possible to have a massage inside the room."

"14.","Diana AA","49","2025-09-30","5","Pantainya lumayan cantik dengan pasir beige putih. Banyak terumbu karang yang sudah mati di bibir pantai, jadi harus hati hati saat berjalan. Omboknya ga terlalu besar jadi kids friendly buat renang atau sekedar main air. Bisa main Jets sky dan kano disini. Tiket masuknya murah"

"19.","p p","35","2025-09-30","2","This is not a 5 star hotel. Far from it. They do not have the amenities of a top tier hotel. The beach is not private to the hotel. Super crowded. No offense but the photos of the beach in their ads was deceptive. Restaurants are mediocre"
"20.","Mu Ahmed","26","2025-08-30","3","Great beautiful location and massive potential. Was 5* Probably in the 90s Suggestions: - room too dated especially the toilet - food can be more variety got boring after couple of days - we woke up to knocking to our door middle of night and staff didn’t really show bother with it. - beach area most parts are filled with litter - had to pay to use bikes and tennis court."
"21.","Pejoewang THTKL","8","2025-08-30","1","- Untuk harga setara, sgt tidak rekomen - Hari pertama, saat bangun tidur baru sadar ternyata di kasur ada tai tikus yg mengering, complain ke receptionish, menanyakan sop, hanya info akan segera dibersihkan. -di hari 1-2, setiap masuk kamar key card selalu eror, penyimpanan sesuai instruksi, tdk bersentuhan dengan card lain maupun hp. Tp tetap rusak, saya dtg hanya dibukakan, kalau mau kunci baru harus ke receptionish. Yg mana malam hari hotel tsb gelap, sangat kurang pencahayaan. Menacari dan memanggil pegawai hotel sangat sulit. - banyak nyamuk - breakfast 2 malam sudah bikin bosan, variasi itu2 saja - insyaallah ini pertama dan terakhir saya ke hotel tsb. Thank you"
"22.","Priyo Wurianto","182","2025-08-30","1","Pelayanan resepsionis sangat buruk untuk ukuran hotel yg katanya bintang 5. Baru kali ini saya dilayani resepsionist sambil duduk dan kakinya diangkat sejajar dh meja. Nama petugas nya Via. Saya menginap hari ini Rabu tgl 13 Agustus 25 di Kamar Bungalow no.129. Sehabis perjalanan jauh dan saya mungkin kelihatan kusut saya mungkin terilihat seperti orang yang tidak mampu menginap di hotel ini. Pertanyaan yg lebih mirip interogasi diajukan untuk membuktikan bahwa saya orang yang sah yg memesan kamar hotel ini. Katanya sih SOP, tapi saya melihat tamu lain di sebelah saya WNA lebih beruntung tidak ditanya serumit itu untuk mendapatkan kunci kamarnya. Standard ganda khusus buat turis lokal yg penampilannya seperti saya. Si turis WNA diantar ke kamarnya pake buggue car sementara kami musti jalan kaki sambil bawa tas sendiri. Saran buat pengunjung lain yg tidak ingin mengalami kejadian serupa, jangan pernah tertarik untuk untuk menginap di hotel ini."
"23.","G E","599","2025-11-30","3","There will be plenty of boat people trying to show thier boats and book for Gili islands. I booked for 1M to do snorkelling and island tour. Next day different old boat came and I had no choice but continue my tour. Many People will be soliciting for business. You need to be cautious and select right boat. The island tour cost is about 700,000 only. You need to bargain. Everything is costly in Lombok. Taxi to move around is expensive. More than 4 days in lombok is enough. Beaches are average in my observation. Snorkelling be careful with jelly fish bites."

"25.","Wiwin Ria Kusuma","49","2025-12-23","4","Old hotel but still good enough, staying there for a good price back to 2024, breakfast is not so great, location is good, only few minutes walking to the centrum of Senggigi"
"26.","Yasmin Afina","107","2025-07-30","2","Sort of a mixed bag. Stayed there for a night with the family and the place is beautiful. The hotel is nestled in a garden that is huge and very well maintained, so on that front it really is a lovely place for walks. The hotel itself has plenty of potential despite being relatively old, the rooms remain comfortable. I think the main issue is the management and service. At breakfast it was so crowded - while the staff checked us in for breakfast they just let us in without ensuring there actually was a table for us. There really are more rooms than capacity for breakfast; perhaps management should consider letting the second restaurant be used for breakfast too. The staff were unhelpful and in the end our family had to be spread out, which spoiled the mood quite a lot. Food is so so, with much that did not seem fresh/was cold. The swimming pool is actually tiny and right in front of the breakfast area which makes it a bit awkward, particularly given how vast the property is. Speaking of which, there seemed to be some sort of corporate event taking place in the garden, but right next to the breakfast area too where they were blasting *very* loud music that made it unpleasant. The personnel by the pool tending to the towels was also very grumpy despite not having anyone else approaching him for towels. Beach was ok despite being a bit dirty, with lots of people selling stuff crowding us very quickly and making it difficult to fully enjoy our time at the beach. These are all issues that can be addressed in one way or another and it'd truly make a difference if taken care of by management for a hotel that has a lot of charm and potential."
"27.","Idol H","10","2025-08-30","1","DO NOT STAY HERE ❌ - RUN DOWN, LIZARDS 🦎 IN ROOMS AND RUDE/ POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE STILL NO REFUND AS PROMISED BY STAFF SINCE OUR STAY IN JUNE and BOOKING.Com DOES NOT SUPPORT WITH THIS CASE EITHER !! I am writing to formally express my deep disappointment with our recent stay at the resort Merumatta Senggigi Lombok booked via your platform. What was meant to be a relaxing and productive retreat regrettably turned into a series of distressing and uncomfortable experiences due to multiple and recurring issues with our accommodation. Our stay began in Room 203, where we were immediately met with a clogged sink and a gecko inside the room. A staff member entered during the night to address this issue, which was quite unsettling. However, by morning, we discovered five more geckos in the room. At that point, we were relocated and offered a complimentary massage, which we appreciated as a goodwill gesture. We were then moved to Room 208, where we encountered further problems: • The toilet did not flush properly, • There was no hot water upon our return from Gili, and • Once again, geckos were present inside the room. While we understand that being in a tropical destination comes with a certain amount of interaction with nature, the presence of multiple geckos and salamanders inside both rooms—without any prior warning or clear indication this was to be expected—was disturbing and not at all conducive to the restful, professional environment we had envisioned. Had we been informed beforehand of such wildlife intrusions, we would have made a more suitable booking elsewhere. This lack of transparency was disappointing and, frankly, unacceptable. We were offered a refund for one night by the property, with the condition that the refund be processed through Booking.com. (WE STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS AND THAT IS THE BARE MINIMUM) We are therefore reaching out to formally raise this complaint and request your assistance in finding a more appropriate and fair resolution. In addition to the distress and inconvenience, we were forced to book alternative accommodation for a night via Booking.com due to the ongoing issues at the property. I am more than willing to provide the details and proof of this additional booking as part of the complaint resolution process."
"28.","JINY","5","2025-08-30","1","This was my first time coming here. But I was extremely disappointed. I recognized that there is an event just the day before. And the people attending the event took up all the beach chairs and pools at the resort. There is loud music, many trash during an event. The event started in the morning and lasted until night. So I couldn't enjoy anything. I have no choice only in a room all day and I ruined one day of my holiday. If you're looking to relax and chill in a resort, never book here."
"29.","Fauzan Kautsar","66","2025-07-30","3","ruanganya bagus dan nyaman, sisanya kurang ok, staf ketus, makanan kurang kalo dibilang ini level resort atau bintang lima, kelas makananannya mungkin hanya setaraf hotel bintang 3"

"31.","Shamile Fiaz","9","2025-09-30","5","I had an amazing time here. The hotel has beautiful views and is very peaceful. The staff are exceptional! I've travelled to many hotels but the care and treatment I received from Mitha was the best, she helped me settle in to my room and provided me with clear communication on the hotel facilities. Januardi was also so helpful in making my stay comfortable. Thank you for hosting me, especially Mitha!"
"32.","Johan","16","2025-08-30","5","Very nice resort! Friendly people, good food and our room very cute. Resort is located on both sides of the sea, perfect for swimming and snorkeling."
"33.","indah nuria Savitri","980","2025-08-30","4","Classic hotel with its timeless charm, beautifully located in Senggigi beach area, Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara. I stayed in one of the garden bungalows and enjoyed my stay. I moved to a new room because of the issue with the fridge but the team did it swiftly. The room dones a classic hut with Indonesian touch, using rattan bed, wooden furnitures, rumbia or grass roof and geribik or interwoven bamboo plats wall. I have shower inside and outside the room. Good for a shower after a walk on the beach or swim.it also offers laundry services. The room is equipped with free coffee and tea, water boiler, big umbrella, safe, and fridge. The breakfast is also good. You can get Indonesian, western, and local food and beverages, including kids menu. I love the fresh fruit and the local cuisines, which is very typical of Lombok. There are pools nearby the restaurant, and the beach is also lovely. But you have to be cautious and careful because it’s an open beach and no lifeguard standby in the area. The waves and the currents are quite strong, probably best for surfing. Sunset here is amazing, make sure you don’t miss it. There are many activities that you can do in hotel area, including yoga, cycling, spa, and more. They have meeting rooms and halls for wedding and big events. Public space is big and strolling around the garden and the beach is always a great idea. Parking lots are spacious as well. Some parts of the hotel are ♿️✅, like the entrance, the garden and the restaurant. Yet my room is a bungalow type with stairs and I see no ramps here. I believe they have dedicated rooms for those with reduced mobility and using wheelchairs.hope they have more ramps in different areas. Service is great, with helpful and handy bell boys and waitresses in the restaurant."

"35.","Dewi Sekarasih","81","2025-11-30","5","I didn't stay here. Someone told me to stop by and enjoy Senggigi Beach from the restaurant. So I walked around the hotel. It was big, with beautiful garden and beautiful beach."
"36.","Gerhard Emmel","11","2025-08-30","4","This hotel is located in a very spacious park. We stayed in a bungalow under palm trees. The bungalows are spread out across the grounds with generous spacing. The open-plan breakfast restaurant, overlooking the pool and sea, caters to every taste, from Indonesian hot meals to egg dishes and a small selection of cold cuts and cheeses. All the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. From the Basiliko restaurant, right by the sea, you can enjoy a fantastic view of the sunset while enjoying a cocktail during happy hour. Thanks to Juni, who treated us to delicious cocktails. We would especially like to thank Daju, who always had a kind word for us at breakfast, served us very friendly and attentively, and was happy to fulfill our special requests. Neyla from the pancake station impressed us with her excellent English skills and her cheerful, friendly manner. She should definitely move to the service area, as many trainees in the service area have very limited English skills. Finally, one last request: The bungalows are in desperate need of renovation, as they are quite worn out."
"37.","Erwin Rachman","34","2025-10-30","5","One of best options when you visit Lombok especially Senggigi area. Even if you are staying somewhere else, you can join their breakfast. The buffet spread at the breakfast is more than enough to keep you stay and you will feel like you want to eat more and more.. LOL."
"38.","Syafiq Segaf","128","2025-11-30","5","The rooms took a long time to be prepared. One of the rooms only has a single king-size bed while we asked for twins. One the rooms had problem with the AC."

"40.","Ilie NAKSZYNSKI","62","2025-07-30","3","A bit run down when it comes to facilities and decorations. But you can always rely on excellent services and personal touches. Arguably the best location for any hotel in Lombok. Great shame that almost all nearby tourist shops no longer in business."
"41.","Lisa Dejoie","8","2025-08-30","5","20th years ago first time stay for our honeymoon, and here we are back to this hotel with another name. Sure the cottage need to renovate, but this hotel is the best place in Senggigi for white sand and for anything you can just walk around for find the market or little warung. Special thanks to Razak and Tari for their kindness service 😊 we're really appreciate."
"42.","Sara Kh","51","2025-08-30","5","Where to begin? An incredible stay! ✨ This was my second time staying at Merumatta Hotel, and it was even better than the first. I spent a wonderful week at the hotel and have truly never met a staff as friendly and kind as the one here. 😍 I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Senggigi who is looking for relaxation and excellent service. ✨ Highlights: • The amazing staff ❤️ • Varied and delicious breakfast 😋 • Sunset views from the restaurant 🌅 • The overall hotel grounds 🌺 • The peaceful pool area 💦 • Close to many restaurants 🍽️ • Near Senggigi Port 🛥️ I would especially like to thank Mr. Kahfi, Mr. Didin, Ms Thary, Ms Maya, Ms Ayudek, Misses Nadine and Neyla from the breakfast team, and Mr. Firman, with whom I had many great conversations. You all made my stay even more enjoyable. 🫶🏼 Thank you again, and see you soon ❤️❤️ With much love, Sara.k"

"52.","Personal For You","42","2025-08-30","4","Very comfortable rooms and good breakfast & service. Sengiggi needs a bit of an uplift. The hotel was a bit on the pricey side however it was peak season."
"53.","Mike S.","196","2025-05-30","3","Hotel is a very nice spot, close to many restaurants. However, it is not 5* - there is no gym, which is required for 5*. Rooms are large, well equipped, beds are comfortable if somewhat hard. However, rooms are tired, bathrooms in need of renovation. Breakfast has limited choices, and food is so-so. Eating there for longer than 3 days would be impossible."
"54.","Lalitya Xaviera (Viera)","148","2025-04-30","5","HIGHLIGHT Hotel buesar bangeeeeeeeettttt tapi areanya terawat. Cocok yang suka jogging. Banyak jogging track. Satu area sama pantai Senggigi jadi pantai kurang private. Pantai berkoral jadi kudu pakai sepatu pantai. Pantai bisa buat berenang. Perfect for family with toddler. Bring the stroller thou. Rooms: Clean n nice. Interior masih jadul tapi OK lah not a big deal. Linen n towel clean n crisp. Kamar wangiiiiii...aku jadi bersin2 masuk kamar 😮‍💨. Tp untung wangi2 ruangan isa dimatikan.. Bathroom clean, amenities lengkap, handuk lengkap. Service. Check in n check out were smooth. Less than 3 minutes each. Bellboy was very nice. The sunset restaurant, forget the name, was too crowded when I arrived. Just to collect my welcome drink took forever. Ask for menu, no waiter came to give us menu. 30 minutes waiting decided to leave the cafe without welcome drink or food. Better serve welcome drink in Lobby area. I know you could upsale menu when people came to cafe to collect their welcome drink. But on high season those arrangements does not work. Breakfast Breakfast variety n taste was so so for 4stars hotel."
"55.","Üsame","73","2025-06-30","5","Highly recommended. You can’t find better hotel in Lombok. The staff is so kind and helpful. The roomservice has amazing foods with affordable prices. I stayed 4 nights here. The only thing which can improve is breakfast."

"58.","fayçal Hamidi","7","2025-04-30","4","Rooms were very nice , though they lacked electric sockets. Bathroom faucets/ taps were too old and dysfunctional. The Villa view was amazing, especially if you book the ones near the beach. Swimming pool is a continuous serpentine around all the villas and the jacuzzi by the swimming pool is really a blast, don't expect hot water and it's perfect like that. The downside is that the restaurants are 5 minutes walk along the beach facade which can be nice or annoying depending on your mood... We had a romantic dinner package and the chef at Basilico deserves Michelin 3 stars, no hesitation. Artefacts, bracelets and T-shirt vendors can be found on the beach and they can be very convenient for souvenirs."
"59.","Lucia Dian","122","2025-05-30","5","Hotel sangat Luas dan Asri, langsung dapat pesisir pantai senggiginya. Proses check in dan check out cepat. Ada helper yg membantu membawakan koper ke cottage. Untuk kamar sendiri, kami mengambil tipe cottage sea view. Benar langsung nembus ke akses pantai. Sayangnya colokan listrik hanya ada 1 di kamar dan 1 dikamar mandi namun kemarin tidak berfungsi. Dinding tidak kedap suara, sehingga suara dari tamu kamar sebelah terdengar jelas di kamar kami jg. Untuk cottage sea view ini dekat dgn Resto, sehingga saat malam minggu terdengar suara music live DJ sampai jam 10an malam. Untuk breakfast Rasanya menurut kami Biasa Saja."

"61.","Hamza Khan","6","2025-06-30","5","⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Unforgettable stay – and special thanks to Neyla! Merumatta Senggigi was everything I hoped for and more. The beachfront location is stunning, the rooms are comfortable and spotless, and the entire resort has a peaceful, welcoming vibe. Breakfast each morning was a highlight — fresh fruit, local dishes, and plenty of Western options too. But what truly made my stay memorable was the kindness of the staff, especially Neyla, one of the waitresses at breakfast. On my final morning, I came down a bit late — breakfast was nearly over. I figured I’d just grab a coffee and go, but Neyla noticed and asked if I wanted something warm. I mentioned pancakes, not expecting much… and five minutes later, she brought out a fresh plate just for me. It was such a small act, but it made a huge impression. Thoughtful, proactive, and genuinely caring — exactly the kind of person who elevates a guest’s experience. Honestly, if anyone on the team deserves recognition (or a step up!), it’s Neyla. People like her are why I’ll absolutely be returning. 🌅🥞👏"

Want to call reception but we already packed up and tired. Let's see tomorrow's room since we will stay 4 days here. Some mosquitoes in bath room and my daughter can't sleep because she saw some gecko 😅 near her bed. Hot water is perfect, resort area is big. Internet speed is superb 100 Mbps up and down link."

"71.","Muhamad Ibrahim","65","2025-03-02","5","Pengalaman yang nyenengin sih bisa nginep disini. Pertama untuk fasilitas kamarnya bisa dibilang oke sih, sesuai sama bintang hotelnya, ada balkonnya cuma kurang di tv aja yang masih agak jadul dan kurang jernih layarnya. Terus untuk sarapannya juga enak, udah ada coffee machine yang bisa dipake buat bikin cappucino, latte, dll. Selain itu yang menarik juga disini ada Indomie, lumayan banget kalo bosen menu makanan hotel, bisa minta dibuatin Indomie. Terakhir yang menarik disini tuh lokasinya yang bener - bener pinggir pantai, jadi kalau mau main pasir pantai sekaligus foto-foto udah tinggal jalan aja karena ada akses buat ke pantai. Ohiya kalau mau olahraga disini juga enak banget, karena hotelnya tuh luas dan jalannya udah berasa jogging track, tapi kalau mau lari-larian nyurusin pantai juga bisa."
"72.","Laura Slavinska","22","2025-05-30","1","Hotel with nice location. City, massages, restaurants just 5 minutes away. Rooms also nice, althought coacroaches comming to room. The hotel is not client oriented and the service from hotel side is horrible. We booked the travel with them and expected to get high level of excursion as we booked trought hotel, but it was the worst expiereance I have received. We got cheated throught this hotel 2 times with excursions. They not wanted to provide details that was written in excursion description, they got us boat that had no stairs to climb back to it, whole day no water provision. And they not wanted to let us out to walk from boat. We needed to visit 3 islands, but we wisited only 2. The waterfall excursion also was a cheating sheme. So do not book any excursions with them! Also massages is better and cheaper outside from hotel. After the horrible excursion expiereance they not provided any better service for us or anything complimentary."

"75.","Zsolt P.","228","2025-04-30","1","Despite many 5-star reviews my experience was very negative and left the hotel with very bad feelings mostly thanks for a hotel restaurant stuffs (uninterested for work and guests), the Basilico beach bar girl (calling a western foreigner a bule is very rude) and some Lobby staff (lying the guests and provide false information so that the guest can feel better). Beside the bad service during breakfast, the breakfast was also a disaster, limited option and no variations is disappointing for a 5-star hotel ... it was more like 3-star hotel. This hotel I choosed also because of his isolated location awaiting peace and relaxation, but on my 3rd day there it was everything just not peaceful and relaxation because that gathering of 200 people making a party 30m from the pool, with screaming crowd-animators. Asking the Lobby staff how long it takes, answer was shortly after 12pm will be over even that they knew that they will have a lunch break around 1.30 - 2pm !!! That's a lie for me. I can praise only the gardeners and the room cleaning guys of that complex and the young guy who worked serving us the dinner, all others were uninterested or rude with their behavior. Sorry, but definitely I won't recommend this hotel."

The location is good and you can walk to supermarkets, massage parlours and restaurants. The grounds are really well maintained and unless the hotel is having an event (there were two while we stayed, one being a concert that finished just before 1am) it is a quiet place. On the downside, everything is old and a bit broken. The blinds didn't close, the bathroom door didn't close, there were tiles missing or loose around the pool area. The staff are friendly but not very efficient. An email about transport from the airport was ignored and it took ages to get our bags collected on the final morning. We enjoyed our stay but wouldn't rush back."

Mengangkat tema sederhana dengan anyaman sebagai aksen dinding, kekedapan suara masih kurang. Banyak hewan seperti cicak dan nyamuk. Lampu kamar kurang cerah. Minim cahaya mungkin karena temanya yang vintage. Untuk makanan belum maksimal juga. So so saja . Untuk kelebihan hotel ini adalah deket pinggir laut. Jadi yg mau hiburan bener2 slow living oke sih. Cuman ya itu utk kamar masih blm sebagus bintang 5 around indonsesia di daerah lain. . Kita kasih score 4. Kesan untuk kembali sepertinya masih blm, lebih prefer nanti kalau kesini lagi mau nyobain hotel yang lain"

We absolutely loved the breakfast, especially the croissants and sashimi, which were fresh and delicious. The resort's tranquil ambience and well-maintained facilities made our time there even more special. The staff's warm hospitality added to the overall experience, and we left with wonderful memories.

Otherwise this is a well-maintained resort. Nice staying here for 4 days."

"111.","Tom Simes","10","2024-12-30","2","We arrived yesterday at 2pm. Hot and tired. The sweet young kid had no idea re taking our bags from the taxi. Our room wasn’t ready. And they’d stuffed up both the room booking and length of stay. We waited an hour. I had to ask several times for a cold drink. The tv doesn’t work. The fridge made loud noises all night. Pillows too high and very uncomfortable. The hotel is VERY run down!! Beach is ok- not very clean. Nothing to see or do nearby. Very run down markets 10 minute walk away. Breakfast was good. Lots of choice. Though took 15 minutes for a cappuccino to arrive, as the buffet coffee was awful. Tea was lukewarm. Chips from restaurant pate and half cold. 25% TAX on top of prices!! I’ve never seen that before: prices on par with Sydney! Staff are young, sweet, helpful, but pretty useless: don’t know what they’re doing, v poor customer service etc. I would not recommend Lombok or this hotel at all."
"112.","Jennifer Folgnand","39","2024-12-30","4","The resort is huge but quiet (not in high season). Rooms are clean and spacious and are actual little bungalows/cottages with an outdoor shower.

The beach is very busy, forget to snorkel here as there are too many locals fishing in the reef."
"113.","Therse Bradley","55","2024-12-30","5","My husband and I stayed here for 11 days , we had a great time, our little bungalow hut was clean and modern, bathroom was clean and outside shower bonus. The staff are friendly and helpful, our room was tidied and cleaned everyday, and fresh towels, the gardens are beautiful, beach right in front great for snorkelling beautiful fish and coral to be found. Happy hour everyday watching the sun set was so beautiful and relaxing, music and food was great although a bit expensive, cheaper restaurants on the main street 5mins walk. Some won't except card will only pay by cash. Breakfast had alot of choices I would of preferred a few more western foods then Indonesian. The tea lady always had a pot of tea for us. Staff were a little slow at resetting the tables that's my only fault. Pool area very clean and pool towels for your benefit, gets very busy on a weekend as the locals have functions so expect it to be busy. Ferry ⛴ Port right in front to Pandang Bai Bali. Overall we had a fabulous stay and will definitely be back again."

"119.","Ross Wortham","46","2024-12-30","3","We stayed at Merumatta for 6 nights in September. We have chosen to leave a detailed review so other travellers have better information than we had before booking. Overall we were very disappointed with our stay. This is far from a 5-star hotel. At best it’s a 3-star hotel, so set your expectations appropriately. At one point in time this was probably a very nice hotel, but it’s under new ownership now and it’s clear they don’t prioritise hotel guests. Amongst all of our issues the noise was by far the worst part. Noise - sadly the hotel’s tropical environment and beach-front access was constantly disrupted by irritating noise and music. Firstly the resort has chosen to prioritise events and functions over guest staying at the resort. In our 6 days they had regular large events playing very loud music, with live DJs and very low-quality bands until 9-11pm every night. The stage was set up directly outside the resort’s beachside bungalows, where we were staying. There was zero consideration for our 3 year old who would normally go to sleep at 7:30-8pm. Not in this hotel… you could clearly hear the music (not to mention the base!) in the rooms. On Sunday morning they started playing deep-base dance music loudly at 6:30am right outside our room for some sort of external group event - it woke all of us up. This event got louder and went on until 10am. Secondly the management had decided to cut down a large 100-year old tree, as it was dropping leaves in the pool. For the 6 days we were at this resort they spent the entirety of each day chainsawing and chopping this tree down. It was so loud that we had to leave each day in search of respite from the chainsaws noise. Poorly trained staff - most of the staff are very young, inexperienced, and untrained. Many were friendly, but equally many were quite rude and seemed very unhappy. Poor food and services - the breakfast buffet was of below-average quality at best. It had a decent range of foods, but all were of poor quality. The young staff at the egg station were constantly overwhelmed and often unable to fulfil orders. Food was not refilled, plates were all wet, and there was very little proactive attention to diners. The best part of breakfast was the one senior staff member on hand, but she is sadly being let go. The food and cocktails at Basilico Restaurant were disappointing and prices are also extraordinarily high for the low-quality that you receive. Thankfully there were several quality local warungs nearby that we chose to eat at most nights. Unreliable wifi - across the entire resort we had unreliable wifi, often it did not work at all, which made day to day life difficult. Dilapidated and old facilities - the rooms are very old and certainly showing their age. Needless to say they are not worthy of a 5-star rating. The bathrooms are functional, albeit small and very old. That said the aircon worked well and the bed was comfortable. The housekeeping staff did an excellent job every day. The poolside bathroom was inaccessible as it was ‘broken’ according the sign, alongside many of the other facilities near the pool area, which were in disrepair. The underwater lights in the pool were also broken with wires floating loose in the water. There were a couple of cute swings near the edge of the resort that our 3-year old wanted to use. Sadly the surrounding area was covered in plastic bottles, bags and litter. This was never cleaned. The one common toilet in the main dining hall was the only one available to guests outside the rooms and it was filthy, covered in toilet water and to top it off it had no soap! The beach - while not the fault of the hotel, the beach was a hotspot for local trinket salesmen, so it was impossible to spend time on the beach without being harassed by multiple sellers. The music was also very loud and disruptive every afternoon. On a positive note, the sunset each day was beautiful and there was decent snorkeling right off the beach."

The service, however, urgently needs training. The waiting times are unreasonably long. The time until we got our drinks took forever. The food we ordered was completely forgotten. Even when we asked, no food was served, it was forgotten again. After waiting for more than an hour, we paid for our food and left the location.

"136.","Dhisar Pranindya Dewa Brata","117","2024-12-30","5","I recently had the pleasure of staying at Merumatta in Senggigi, and it was an overall fantastic experience. Nestled in a peaceful area with breathtaking views of the ocean and surrounding landscape, the hotel offers a serene atmosphere that’s perfect for both relaxation and exploration. The location is ideal, just a short walk from the beach and the restaurants. While it's away from the hustle and bustle, it's still close enough to all the attractions in Senggigi. The beach is a few minutes away, and you can easily take a short ride to visit nearby areas or enjoy a variety of water activities. My room had a beautiful ocean view, and the balcony was a perfect spot to enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning. The bed was comfortable, and the amenities, such as air conditioning, Wi-Fi, and a mini-fridge, worked flawlessly. The staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, always willing to go the extra mile to make my stay more enjoyable. From arranging transportation to suggesting local spots to explore, they made me feel right at home. Merumatta offers a lovely outdoor pool, which is ideal for relaxing after a day of sightseeing. The on-site restaurant serves delicious local, international cuisine and located in the sea side, with fresh ingredients and great flavors. The breakfast buffet was a highlight—plenty of choices, including local dishes, and it was a great way to start the day. Merumatta is a hidden gem in Senggigi. It combines the tranquility of the area with all the comforts of a well."

"140.","Ella Taylor","12","2024-12-30","1","Do not stay here. Hotel was so noisy we had to leave and pay for a new hotel additionally to what we paid for this one just to get out of the hell hole. We booked and paid extra for this hotel only to get twin rooms we messaged in June to confirm twin rooms and again the day before. We arrived and they said no twin rooms. No compensation was offered. They tried to fit a child’s metal camp bed with thin mattress in the room. We turned this away as there wasn’t even the space for it to go. We only continued to stay as we were promised a twin room the next night. We had to remind them to move our stuff the next day we went out for the day only to come home to find they had moved our stuff to a family room which was the same king bed as the last but a larger room with a child’s camp bed in the corner. Neither of us adults staying in the room wanted to sleep on the metal thin mattress noisy child’s camp bed obviously so we had to share beds again. The only reason we paid the high price for this hotel was for the twin beds which have not been provided and no compensation. We have had to un pack and re pack our stuff twice we were not able to do laundry as didn’t know new room number. We went to the restaurant and my mum got hard undercooked ravioli she had to leave. There were numerous bugs in both rooms. The room we were moved to is right next to the bar which blasted terrible loud singing and music until 10:00 o’clock when we wanted to go to sleep at 8 after a long day traveling. This hotel ruined our stay at Lombok as every time we came home it ruined the mood as we were reminded of how much we have paid for such a disappointing hotel in every way. The second room had a hand held shower. The first room had only one plug socket. The second room the tv didn’t work. The pool is ugly the breakfast is disappointing and all the continental food was covered in flys the staff let guests smoke in the non smoking area of breakfast. The aircon was the worst we had the whole time in Bali giving us both colds. We stayed at 3 star hotels in canguu and gilli t and had a much better experience in both hotels this so called 5 star hotel was double the price and the worse experience we had. Had a headache all night listening to the awful singing at full volume so loud it was hurting my head. Felt like I was in hell not a holiday. Had to sit with air plugs in awake in my own room even when just walking around and on phone as it’s so loud. We both just had to sit in bed with ear plugs in waiting or it to end. It didn’t even go off at ten we had to call and complain at 10 past. After writing this last night we were then awaken by music blasting so loud we could hear it through our ear plugs at 6:30 in the morning waking us up. Even after I rang and made them turn it off we could not get back to sleep after this. There is also an ant infestation in the room I killed 8 getting out of the shower. 3 of our days holiday has been ruined our arrival day when wer had the bad news about the room and had to un pack and un pack and have the mood ruined. The next day as we found out our room was still not a twin but moved to a worse room with music giving us a headache all night. And today where we are now too tired to enjoy our day trip as we have been woken up at 6:30. We have two days to go and this is hell on earth"

"144.","ECHO E-Sport","2","2024-12-30","5","I recently had the pleasure of staying at Merumatta Senggigi, and my experience was nothing short of fantastic. The moment I stepped into the lobby, I was greeted by a warm and inviting atmosphere. The staff's friendliness added a personal touch to the check-in process, setting a positive tone for my entire stay. The cleanliness of the hotel was impressive – from the lobby to the room, every corner sparkled. The attention to detail in maintaining a spotless environment did not go unnoticed. It's evident that the housekeeping team takes great pride in their work. The room itself was a cozy retreat. The bed was not only comfortable but adorned with fresh, crisp linens that contributed to a restful night's sleep. The decor was tasteful and created a serene ambiance. The attention to creating a cozy atmosphere extended to thoughtful details like soft lighting and plush furnishings. The hotel's commitment to cleanliness and creating a comfortable environment made my stay truly enjoyable. I would highly recommended Merumatta Senggigi to anyone seeking a delightful blend of cleanliness and coziness during their travels."

"146.","Andrea Rossi","117","2023-12-30","1","We booked this hotel to spend a few days of our honeymoon. The external location is perfect, clean, surrounded by greenery. A beautiful location is not enough. I work in hotels, I know how they work, this unfortunately has bad management. The staff is not trained, not even on basic information. Completely disorganized. The room assigned to us was completely ruined, the service in the restaurant was terrible, the staff did not speak English. I was told that the spa is open 24 hours non-stop, I booked a massage at 10.45am and they almost sent me away telling me they were closing. Fake Italian restaurant, poor quality products and a pizza with frozen products and certainly not Italian. We asked for a cappuccino at breakfast and it was served to us after 20 minutes, the drink was not good and well made, honestly for the price they ask they should have staff who at least know how to prepare a cappuccino. Breakfast is closing at 11, at 10:40 everything is empty and if is finish you can’t eat anymore. We went to Indonesian restaurant they have just 1 waiter for all the restaurant his name is KETUT he was the best things in this hotel he give us the best service. But other things honestly no. We sat at the outside table on the beach, after 30 minutes no waiter who was present came to ask us if we wanted to order, perhaps they were too busy being on the phone. Honestly it was the poorest hotel of my entire honeymoon and I was also very disappointed by it."
"147.","Yulifar Widodo","129","2022-12-30","5","Might be one of the best hotels at Senggigi Beach, the room is quite old but still well maintained. Foods are good generally, staffs are friendly and helpful. Stayed for 2 nights here, unfortunately it was in rainy season on November. While the place itself was excellent, the cottage/garden style which covers vast area makes it difficult to roam about when raining though an umbrella is provided for each room. Boogey cars also available for guests but limited. A restaurant and bar by the beach are also available for guests to enjoy the sunset or just to chill out. Overall it was a great experience to stay here. Recommended."

Kemarin nginep disini milih kamar yg langsung depan pintu menuju ke pantai, jadi dianter sama buggy karena mungkin kasian ya udah bawa anak kecil jga😄😄 makasihh!! Kamarnya rapi,wangi jga. Amanitiesnya lengkap. Makan malam aku pesen makanan di bar pantainya, makanannya enak! Tapi kayaknya varian menunya gak sebanyak Kila Senggigi, karena nyari steak tapi ndak ada. Tapi pizza nya enak, tipis, pizza ala italy gitu😄 harganya jga terjangkau. Pesen 4 makanan cuma habis 200k an, sekelas hotel berbintang itu harganya murah pol sih. Dan... kemarin kesana tepat sama lebaran ketupat, jadi rame bgt, masuk hotel agak kesusahan karena macet pol. Dan dipantainya full pengunjung pantai, jadi kerasa gak private beach😭 tapi gpp, ttp cantiiik"

Oleh receptionist diberi voucher welcome drink di sunset bar, dan akan dijemput setelah kamar tersedia. Namun yang membuat kecewa, dari 3 hotel yang kami tempati selama di lombok, 2 hotel lainnya menyajikan welcome drink saat kami hendak check-in di receptionist. Sedangkan disini, kami diberi kupon welcome drink di sunset bar, harus berjalan ke sunset bar dan menunggu >20 menit untuk welcome drink, itupun baru disajikan setelah kami tanyakan lagi mana welcome drinknya (padahal kupon sudah diberikan). Jam 14.00, masih juga tidak ada staff yang menjemput. Akhirnya berinisiatif menelepon receptionist, ternyata kamar sudah siap dan kami diminta untuk ke lobby. Hahaha. Karena awalnya dibilang akan dijemput, kami minta dijemput, tapi tidak ada yg datang setelah menunggu cukup lama, akhirnya kami pun berjalan ke lobby sambil lihat2 review di google. Oooh, ternyata banyak juga yang mengeluhkan service yang lamban dari hotel ini bahkan ada yang bilang menunggu 90 menit ketika memesan makanan di restoran. Untung saya baca review, jadi saya menghindari kecewa kedua kalinya dan lebih mengandalkan gofood untuk makan malam."

The seaside restaurant serves good Italian food (pizza, pasta, etc.) while you enjoy the sunset view. The whole place is tranquil, especially in the morning.

Private beach with soft sand and blue waters. Well kept gardens by the gardeners, they always greeted us too. Great location in Senggigi, there are restaurants, spa/salons, mini markets and beach clubs nearby.

I’m not sure you will love the room if you ask modern style hotel. I got a beach view room, but it’s in old style hotel room, with three doors(front main door, balcony door, and connecting door).

I have been travelling Indonesia for a month, this was by far the most expensive hotel we stayed at and also the worst. Service is ridiculously slow, anything in the hotel costs a fortune by Indonesian standards and the idea that you can relax here is a joke when they have music blaring out from 10am to 10pm so loud it makes your room shake. We were told this was for an on site special event but was not told in advance and the staff didn't seem to care that this meant that we had to leave the hotel during the day because my girlfriend was sick (this was possibly a result of breakfast) and couldn't cope with the noise."

Room is not really big, with a bit oldy style but still comfy. The food for a 5 star hotel just so-so, not many various menu with average taste.

Menunggu sampai jam 15.30 Wita kamar masih belom ready. Akhirnya bisa dapat deluxe sea view sesuai kamar yg kami order. Menginap 18 Mei-19 Mei. Kenapa harus ribet soal kamar kalao emang bisa dapet yg sesuai pesanan kami"
"206.","Evi AR","27","2021-12-30","5","Tahun kedua pandemi,hotel ini direkomendasikan bagi yang memilih menginap di pusat obyek wisata Senggigi dengan layanan sangat bagus namun harga jauh lebih murah dibandingkan masa normal.Dari sisi view,hotel ini berhadapan dengan garis pantai untuk menikmati sunset apalagi jika memilih kamar bungalow.Untuk keluarga yang membawa anak,kolam renangnya tidak menyediakan lifeguard sehingga harus mengawasi sendiri anak-anak. Makanan yang disuguhkan oleh resto juga enak dan berada persis di pinggir pantai. Secara keseluruhan, hotel ini bagus dan sangat direkomendasikan."
"207.","Putu Tonsen","869","2021-12-30","5","Resort ini lumayan bagus. Dan memang oas sebagai tempat berlibur. Lokasinya di Pantai Senggigi. Style bangunan bergaya cottage berlantai dua. Masing-masing cottage terdiri dari 8 kamar. Empat kamar di lantai satu dan 4 kamar di lantai 2.. bagusbya lagi tiap kamar punya beranda belakang. Punya pemandangan yang bagus ke arah laut. Areanya sendiro juga cukup luas. Dalan setapak yang ada di resort ini menjadikannya sangat bagus buat jogging di pagi hari. Saat makan malam adalah waktu yang menyenangkan. Sering disetup untuk makan di area outdoor di samping pantai. Hiburan live music juga juga ada. Nice place and recommended."
"208.","Youngwoong Kim","15","2019-12-30","5","Really loved this place. The resort was quite large with its own personal beach. They had plenty of activity options such as tennis or basketball courts. They have a buffet with not much but enough options. The room, while compact, it had a really nice look to it while being very clean and nicely arranged. If I were to come around this area, I would definitely choose this place -or at the minimum be top of my list. Comparing its price and its quality of accommodation, it was phenomenal and I would come back again."
"209.","Ruhul Amin","19","2022-12-30","3","We spent 8 nights during the Christmas and New Year eve to stay closer to nature. The location of the resort is lovely. External atmosphere is awesome. However, we had a horrible experience with check in and check out. At check in, they gave us a drink coupon for two, while we were three; they told breakfasts were allowed for two. Later, they have apologized and offered breakfast for three. Staff are friendly. Breakfast is average. The room is very small and toilet is even smaller compared to other 4 stars hotel. They have provided limited toiletries. And the check-out!!! I was asked to pay 800K IDR for the 31st gala night, which did not eat. When I asked to show me the bill with my signature, they could not. We had an early flight, I had to leave, but they did not apologize for that."

Receptionist tidak ramah, cenderung ketus dalam menginfokan hal tersebut -tanpa ada kata maaf-, mengingat ini adalah resort hotel besar, seharusnya hospitality bisa lebih baik daripada itu, apalagi dari seorang-dua orang front liner yang akan langsung memberikan first impression kepada customer. Kebersihan kamar cukup baik, Sarapan standar hotel bintang 4, overall could be a great stay"

"213.","Dwi Aditya Darmawan","107","2023-12-30","4","Mengunjungi penginapan ini untuk mengisi acara. 1. Lokasi Dekat dengan pantai Senggigi dan dekat juga dengan jalan raya yang dipenuhi toko dan restoran. Sangat mudah diakses. 2. Pelayanan Pegawai sangat ramah. Dari segi fasilitas juga tidak ada catatan khusus karena bagi saya sudah sesuai dengan yang saya harapkan. 3. Kamar Bersih dan saya suka kamar dengan interior entik. Tidak ada catatan khusus. Sebenarnya tidak ada keluhan selama saya berada di sini, namun karena wilayah penginapan yang sangat luas sehingga untuk menuju titik-titik tertentu memerlukan waktu. Bahkan pegawai di sini menggunakan kendaraan seperti sepeda dan mobil golf. Mungkin saya diajarkan untuk menikmati setiap perjalanan yang ada di sini dan tidak perlu tergesa-gesa. Menarik. Terima kasih."
"214.","Adrian Wardhana","114","2023-12-30","5","Can't say much of the rooms because I didn't stay at Merumata, but from what I've gathered from locals it's an older hotel which was refurbished. The hall/Ballroom was spacious and clean. But the ac couldn't keep up with the heat, particularly at noon. Location was good, it had a private beach but the waves were strong, particularly near the giant MERUMATA signage in the mini peninsula. Food was good, however as note the soap in the Ballroom toilet was perpetually empty. It had not been filled in the three days we were there for the convention"

We ordered pizza and also it wasn't good although prices are very expensive. We aimed the private beach however after we asked reception they said we can enter and order something from the restaurant however when we reached the restaurant we were forbidden to use the sunbeds unless we pay extra. The waves were very strong so no one could swim and we learned later that most of the time, you can't swim here because of that. It was a waste of time and money."

Terdapat kolam renang cukup luas di samping restoran yang menghadap ke laut. Semua fasilitas dan sarana dan prasarana hotel terawat dengan baik. Suasana hotel sangat tenang. Suara ombak terdengar membelai bibir pantai. Bagi yang senang dengan suasana yang tenang, hotel ini bisa jadi alternatif pilihannya. Yang sangat berkesan bagi saya selama menginap di hotel adalah pelayanan staf hotel, yang sangat ramah dan selalu membantu saya yang sdg ada masalah dengan vision. Seluruh staf hotel sangat memperhatikan dan membantu untuk memudahkan aktivitas dan kebutuhan saya. Saya mengucapkan terima kasih banyak atas perhatian dan bantuan yang diberikan. Namun saya ingin juga menyampaikan terima kasih saya secara khusus utk mas Abdul Razak yg selalu mengantarkan saya dengan golf car dan Bu Ayu yang melayani saya di restoran.

"227.","Arkan Athaullah Helmi","253","2022-12-30","4","1st of all, from general aspects (the park, pool, beach, bungaloos) this hotel is arguably the best hotel that I've stayed so far (there is one hotel in Mecca that I've stayed that is pretty cool too although of course i believe a lot of it's features are indoors). But i think i just can't rate it 5 stars for probably 'not so important' things. ye know this hotel is supposed to be 5 stars hotel but.. well yeah, for the views absolutely gorgeous, staffs are incredibly incredibly polite, quick respond services, such a chill place, and it's humongous areas. But, it was my first stayed in a bungaloo and there are some pretty annoying mosquitoes, lizards, and big giant ants. The pool, even though it supposed to be open at 09.00 they said, some parts are still quite dirty from leaves and things like that. Fridge inside my room was quite loud at night, and i think i can hear the people that stayed next door are talking. The quality of the objects (inside the room) and products that being offered are generally pretty decent with some exception like the fridge and the toilet in my opinion. But yeah, i think I would revisit it again someday."

The thing is, hotel staffs didn't seem to notice my condition (even though my knees were visibly bandaged) and they made me walk back and forth to the resto and lobby and room without even offering help to carry my luggage. Because of the lack of sensitivity, I gave 4 stars for service (otherwise than that the service were very good & friendly). Room was comfortable, clean, and cozy; only the door was quite hard to open and giving me hard times everytime I got out of room, so another 4 stars."

"241.","Anthony James","53","2022-12-30","4","I enjoyed my stay here. My family and I booked the one of the pool club villas, and by all accounts it was a great room. Large and spacious with air conditioning. The welcome fruits were eaten very quickly as they tasted extremely fresh. The room was kept clean for the entire trip by the excellent cleaning staff. Please note however that there is no 3 pin plug sockets in the rooms, and no plug sockets at all near the bed. I had to ask reception to send one to me, which they did as quickly as they could. The layout of the hotel, although large and spread out is actually easy to get around by yourself. No need for the golf carts, unless you are moving your luggage. Some of the paths are cracked and broken but you should expect that for the area. The staff are amazing and are always trying to help you make the most of your stay. However, the villa I was in had no hot water. Not such and issue as we tend to only shower quickly. Even after reporting it we still didn't get any. Outside of the room by the pool there us a jacuzzi area. But it looked like it hadn't been used in ages, I do think the it just had some water damage which made it look unclean but still. The breakfast had a nice location, looking out at the sea. It was ok, nothing to special, I would call it functional. The sunset bar/ Italian restaurant served ok food not amazing (which to be fair was repeated in many restaurants outside the hotel, the expecting that we found was the square which is past the happy cafe) and a little overpriced. Overall my trip to Lombok was great and I really enjoyed it. You do see alot of trash around on the beaches, which are not part of any hotel, and the roads. The hotel is great, would definitely go again, but please fix the hot water. I hate showering with cold water."

It feels you are staying in 90s style hotel. The varieties of breakfast is also acceptable. Compared to similar rated hotel in Bali, of course the Balinese one is more prominent. However the service is excellent. And the view is so nice. So it might be one of the options you would choose while in Lombok"

"252.","Fabian","47","2023-12-30","5","My girlfriend and I stayed for 6 nights in August 2023. The Hotel was clean and there was constantly lots of staff (cleaning rooms and taking care of the lawn/plants). Yes it is right the whole property seems like it could need some investments here and there (new fridges in the rooms for example). But you need to take into consideration that in 2018 there was an earthquake in the north of Lombok and afterwards Covid. So hardly any tourists for almost 5 years and that means hardly any money for the tourism industry. The breakfast was really nice with lots of choices of western breakfast and also local options. Just to point out how helpful the staff was. I arrived sick from Bali and had a fever. I was sweating so badly that all the sheets were wet. One o‘ clock in the morning my girlfriend went to the reception and asked for new sheets. 20 minutes later they came to our room and brought them. Outstanding service!! I would recommend Merumatta Hotel for around 50€ to 55€ per night in the bungalow. That would be the price/value ratio I would look for."

Hotel ini hotel bintang 5 litereally bener2 bintang 5, sebagus itu mulai dr hotel,view,fasilitas,keramahan,kebersihan dll.

"276.","Almira Tiyakusuma","33","2018-12-30","5","Tempat luas, nyaman dan sejuk.

Begitu datang kita diberikan minuman, pelayanannya bagus, saya menginap di kamar Deluxe Sea View Room , pesan dua kamar ada conecting doornya cocok jika kita bawa keluarga, satu kamar bed besar dan satunya lagi double bed, kamarnya langsung menghadap ke pantai dan ada berandanya, sambil ngobrol kita sambil memandangi laut, seneng banget nginap di kamar ini.

"282.","Edo Lombok","90","2021-12-30","5","Satu dari beberapa hotel berbintang yang masih bertahan dan makin berkembang di kawasan wisata Senggigi. Lokasinya tepat berada di kawasan Pantai Senggigi yang selalu ramai dikunjungi wisatawan lokal. Demikian juga dengan Surfing Spot yang berada dekat hotel. Meskipun hotel ini dekat dengan kawasan pantai yang selalu ramai dikunjungi wisatawan lokal, tamu hotel masih bisa tinggal dengan nyaman. Pilihan kamar sea view yang berhadapan langsung ke arah matahari tenggelam dimana siluet Gunung Agung bisa terlihat jelas. Akses menuju hotel juga cukup mudah. Terdapat pelabuhan untuk kapal cepat yang melayani rute penyeberangan ke 3 Gili (tramena) dan juga penyeberangan langsung ke Bali."
"283.","Muh Faezal","10","2020-12-30","5","Hotelnya sangat nyaman, tenang, stafnya ramah ramah. Jika ingin ke Pantai, tidak perlu jauh-jauh karena hotel ini ada di pinggir pantai.

This is a subjective review from my point of view."

Lantai 2 tempat tidurnya King Size, ada kamar mandi lengkap dengan bathtub. Lantai 1 Twin bed. Ada TV, meja makan, Sofa dan kamar mandi. Peralatan makan lengkap. Ada Jacuzzi juga. Suasanya nyaman, sepi. Jadi cocok banget bagi yang mencari ketenangan dari hiruk pikuk kota. Staffnya juga ramah-ramah. Dari Villa ke Restaurant cukup jauh jadi nanti di antar oleh staf hotel menggunakan buggy car."
"294.","Diana Kusumawati","120","2023-12-30","5","Lokasi tepi pantai, pilih kamar garden view tetap bisa menikmati suasana pantai, lokasi kamar tersebar agak jauh, disediakan golf car untuk transport tapi terbatas. Bisa menikmati sunrise dan sunset di pantai"

We had a pizza which had a good amount of toppings (the base was a pre packaged frozen one but eh). The room is a good size and the bathroom is well presented. The bed is comfortable and with ocean views and just a short trip outside you can see mountains!! Expedia did not confirm our reservation with the facility and they gave us a free upgrade as an apology (although no wrong doing on their behalf) Recommend to anyone traveling to Lombok!"
"299.","Eva Riskila","28","2023-12-30","5","Fabolous, bener2 indah banget ini hotel, luas banget. Kalau udah disini actually sayang mau jalan2 keluar, Karna di hotelnya sendiri sudah terlalu indah untuk di lewatkan. Fasilitas nya lengkap, pegawainya super ramah."
"300.","Lyana Sulistyanti","11","2022-12-30","3","Fasilitas bagus.. luar biasa.. Tapi.. pelayanan.. agak mengecewakan.. sejak mulai booking, dari ig, email tidak fast respon, telp beberapa kali tidak diangkat. Karena saya bawa orang tua yang tidak bisa berjalan jauh, sangat tergantung dengan boogienya..tetapi beberapa kali di php. Minta di jemput di resto sejak sebelum adzan maghrib, menunggu lama sampai 30 menit lebih boogie tidak datang2 , akhirnya kebetulan ada boogie lewat saya cegat minta tolong diantar.. ketika diatas boogie ternyata front officenya baru menghubungi petugas boogienya ketika kami di atas boogie dan petugas boogie mengakui bahwa sampai saat itu tidak ada yang menghubungi kalau ada tamu yang perlu penjemputan. Ketika check out pun menunggu boogie hampir 45 menit. Dan kami harus konfirmasi terlebih dahulu. Padahal alangkah lebih baiknya bila memang sedang full kami diberitahukan sebelumnya jadi ngga menunggu lama. Ketika check in dan check out tempatnya berbeda. Sayang sekali fasilitas yang begitu sempurna tapi pelayanan ke customernya mengecewakan. Semoga bisa lebih diperbaiki lagi"
"301.","Faqih Addien (Faqih)","165","2022-12-30","5","Top servis! Untuk tahun recovery covid, Merumatta layak menyandang labelnya sebagai hotel 5 stars. 2 malam saya menginap, dinner di antar ke kamar, sarapan lengkap menu western dan indonesia, olahraga pagi keliling komplek, dan kolam renang yang bagus. Patut dicoba kamar yang menghadap langsung ke kamar, masih belum dicoba."
"302.","Christina Ken Maria","233","2018-12-30","4","Hotel lama, tetapi enak. Kesini karena acara outing kantor. Suasananya rindang banget, kalau suka pohon - akan bilang kalau tempatnya teduh dan asik. Kalau tidak suka - akan bilang tempatnya spooky. Ada 2 tipe: tipe vila dan tipe hotel.. Kebetulan aku dapat yang tipe hotel. Waktu masuk, agak pengep rasanya. Lalu saya setting ac mode dry, sekitar satu jam. Udah beres, ngga pengep lagi - pindah ke mode cool. Fasilitas di dalam dan di luar kamar oke, sarapan oke. Kekurangannya adalah agak susah mencari lokasi kamarnya. Nomer kamar tidak mencerminkan lantai berapa, tetapi unit. Di map nya agak sulit dibaca unit berapa ada dimana. Petunjuk arahnya kurang mengakomodasi.. Tapi staff nya sangat helpful bgt, jadi bisa tanya kamar sekian ada di mana ya dan diantarkan berapa kali pun kita butuh.."

Hanya tersedia sabut batangan bulat yang biasa ada di washtafle. Petugas room service mengatakan memang tidak disediakan. Air panas tidak menyala, sudah komplain kepada petugas hotel yang lewat didepan kamar, tapi tidak ada perbaikan. Kami memesan extrabed juga, namun extrabed baru dimasukkan pukul 12 malam dengan alasan miss comunication, padahal kami sudah menghubungi reseptionis berkali-kali."

Standards are very high here, and now as Kila Sengiggi, the hotel is extremely well run and maintained. Situated on it's own small peninsula with beaches on all sides and vast mature immaculate gardens, there are many and varied outdoor spaces to enjoy. The gardens here really are superb and very cared for. The beachfront area has a great restaurant with beach dining, reasonable prices with live music and cool sea breezes. Rooms are attractive, roomy, very clean, king bed is extra large and comfortable, own wooden verandah and all built with natural materials. Staff are the friendliest of anywhere we have stayed, whether front reception, cleaners, gardeners, restaurant staff..everyone has a friendly smile and a kind hello. Staff here go above and beyond for guests, with very high standards of service. An absolutely beautiful resort, we are always sad to leave.

Despite being the oldest hotel in Lombok (or so I heard) it’s taken care pretty well, GREAT FOOD (for locals like me, dont know for foreigners) , clean and comfy rooms, dont feel like its already 58 years old. The staff is really polite and nice and very helpful. The hotel is 12 acres wide, so it has a really long beach line. It also has a nice beach side restaurant, many chairs and tables so its highly unlikely u cant get one . Its a perfect hotel for trainings & families looking to spend their holiday in a wide resort area."

"353.","Fab C","1484","2018-12-30","2","CHEAP resort trying to be classy but doesn't really know how. Complaints (taking into consideration that the cost of a room equals about 1 month local salary) 1. Welcome drink while room was prepared was restricted to 1 flavour of local fizzy drink. Was recovering from food poisoning when I arrived and asked for watermelon juice or bottle of water instead and was refused. 2. Our room was 20 metres from the check-in fest, but the porter took us the long route bout 150 metres in the sun to make it look longer to get a tip. 3. Bathroom door was damaged and couldn't lock. 4. Towel rail was lose and dangerous. 5. Twin beds were the smallest I have ever seen outside of a hostel. 6. Large glass fronted fridge in room was very noisy so had to turn it off to sleep and drinks were overpriced given the cost of the room. 7. The only restaurant in Lombok I visited with a 21% tax and service charge. 8. Loud music started just before sunset playing bad cover versions killing any chance if watching a romantic or peaceful sunset. So loud could hear it 200 metres away at the far end of the beach. Having staff trained to be polite and see how you are every time they see you doesn't make the resort high class. Only good point was the breakfast, or would be a 1 star rating."

Breakfast was plenty and delicious. Beautiful place to catch sunset and start the morning. Room is nice. Bathroom is okay for a very old hotel (the first big hotel in Lombok, i suppose) Ah surprise...a bolster! Barbeque by the beach was fabulous! We should have enjoyed it longer but we have to come back to the class. We were having our bootcamp in Kila"

"446.","Dian Puspita Sari","152","2020-12-30","1","The resort area is vast and beautiful, sitting at the promontory of Senggigi beach. It is located at the prime location at Senggigi with a long beach line where you can stroll around in the morning or while waiting for the sunset in the afternoon. The breakfast was OK. However, the service was poor and the way they handle check-in problems were awful. So we booked a 'back to travel' package online, from an Online Travel Agent (OTA). This package comes with several benefits including a COVID-19 hampers, free bike-rent for 2, discount for Barbeque, welcome drink in the room, etc. When we checked-in, the reception said there's no such package, so we only get the room. My husband asked to talk to the manager about this issue, and the reception connected us to Mr. DXXI who was said to be responsible for bookings. He responded to our complaint apathetically, saying that we should contact the OTA instead of complaining to the hotel. He also mentioned that the garden view room, the room that we booked is THE CHEAPEST room available. We found it very rude and humiliating. The garden view room is the only room type offered in the package. At this point, it was not only about the package, but more about how they treat guests who booked their package online. We still dissatisfied but we left the reception and headed to our room. My husband contacted the OTA customer services and complained about the package. Two hours later, after my husband checked the hotel's website and found the very same package, back to travel package and its benefits mentioned in the website, we're back to the reception and ask to meet the manager. Long story short, after talking to an assistant manager (a lady), and the manager himself, they reluctantly apologized about the package and about how Mr. DXXI treated us, but still, they could not provide some of the benefits due to COVID-19 (specifically: welcome drink - in the room). I cannot comprehend, why would they offer 'Back to Travel Package', which I assume, to encourage people to stay at their hotel during this pandemic, if they cannot delivered the promised benefits due to COVID-19 pandemic. The lady assistant manager also said that we did not get all the benefit because the OTA price that we paid for the package was below the Hotel's price on the website. I applaud their ridiculous reasoning. The discount for the barbeque was said to be converted to a discount for the restaurants because the barbeque was not available that day, and they totally missed to discuss about the hampers. The lady assistant manager also repeatedly remind us that the bike is only for two hours, not more (very nice of her). GOSH! It's just put me off (again). I wasn't into riding bike, but before, I think it's just nice to see that I have the option. My husband asked the manager about how the restaurant would know if we get a discount, on which the manager said that we'll get a voucher coupon to be shown to the restaurant, but until we left the hotel, no voucher was given. So the bottomline, what benefit did we get from the package? Nothing, except the troubles at check-in, rude responses and comments from the staff (esp. Mr. DXXI and the assistant manager lady) and insincere apology. We definitely won't be back to this hotel."

"453.","William C Nee","14","2018-12-30","5","Ten Days in Lombok, and thank god we stayed at Kila Senggigi. You can do Lombok in about three or four days MAX. Unfortunately, I read some reviews before coming so I booked 10 days thinking there was much that Lombok offered. I think those reviews were biased, perhaps written by sensory deprived, overworked, underpaid, newly retired wonks. For a background, Lombok has a population of about 4.3 million people--without basic sanitation like trash disposal and sewers, in an area smaller than Los Angeles--imagine a larger population in a smaller area without basic services. This has a huge impact on the environment. There is trash everywhere. The population is undernourished and fish relentlessly depleting most populations of fish except for the more inaccessible areas. The tour guides will take you to those areas less depleted, about three of them, but you cannot escape the trash bags of plastic entwined on your legs in the pristine beach waves. Nor the kids, who should be in school, offering you trinkets as they hustle tourists to make a living for their families. Nor the hundreds of locals at the beautiful waterfalls who do not observe a pack in, pack out ethos. Imagine natural beauty besieged by humanity and you have a good idea of Lombok. Kila Senggigi was a refuge from Lombok, but is also impacted by the same demographics--poverty. There are very few fish in the waters around this beautiful hotel, and sometimes the water developed a brown foam which we avoided. The torture of staying in paradise--their menu never changed; the beauty of Lombok--we were multi-billionaires in the relative sense of wealth. Oh, there is a cool zoo on Lombok, an elephant park, with an orangutan that likes to play with visitors--one of the three highlights of Lombok. Everything else written about this island is tourism marketing. They don't tell you about the other stuff that impacts your experience."

Also not a lot of choice of restaurants or bars. Only can choose from the hotel. I think its better to go to the main senggigi beach."

Sehabis perjalanan jauh dan saya mungkin kelihatan kusut saya mungkin terilihat seperti orang yang tidak mampu menginap di hotel ini. Pertanyaan yg lebih mirip interogasi diajukan untuk membuktikan bahwa saya orang yang sah yg memesan kamar hotel ini.

Meja-meja tidak diatur ulang untuk sarapan, terus-menerus harus meminta peralatan makan, lalu gelas dan serbet, kopi cepat habis dan jus tidak diisi ulang, seperti sistem siapa cepat dia dapat dan tidak diisi ulang untuk mengakomodasi tamu meskipun ada banyak staf. Meja-meja di beranda tempat anak-anak makan tidak pernah dibersihkan dan terbuat dari plastik sehingga mudah dibersihkan tetapi malah Anda duduk di atas makanan dan jus, toilet di sekitar area kolam renang menjijikkan, Netflix di layar besar menayangkan film horor yang sangat eksplisit dengan anak-anak berusia 3 dan 4 tahun menonton, tidak direkomendasikan."

"624.","Idol H","10","2025-08-20","1","JANGAN TINGGAL DI SINI ❌ - RUSAK, KADAL 🦎 DI KAMAR DAN LAYANAN PELANGGAN YANG KASAR/BURUK MASIH TIDAK ADA PENGEMBALIAN UANG SEPERTI YANG DIJANJIKAN OLEH STAF SEJAK KAMI MENGINAP DI BULAN JUNI dan BOOKING.Com JUGA TIDAK MENDUKUNG KASUS INI!! Saya menulis surat ini untuk secara resmi menyampaikan kekecewaan mendalam saya atas kunjungan terakhir kami di resor Merumatta Senggigi Lombok yang dipesan melalui platform Anda. Apa yang seharusnya menjadi tempat peristirahatan yang santai dan produktif sayangnya berubah menjadi serangkaian pengalaman yang menyedihkan dan tidak nyaman karena berbagai masalah yang berulang dengan akomodasi kami. Penginapan kami dimulai di Kamar 203, di mana kami langsung mendapati wastafel yang tersumbat dan seekor tokek di dalam kamar. Seorang anggota staf masuk pada malam hari untuk mengatasi masalah ini, yang cukup meresahkan. Namun, pada pagi harinya, kami menemukan lima tokek lagi di dalam kamar. Saat itu, kami dipindahkan dan ditawari pijat gratis, yang kami hargai sebagai tanda terima kasih. Kami kemudian dipindahkan ke Kamar 208, di mana kami mengalami masalah lebih lanjut: • Toilet tidak bisa disiram dengan benar, • Tidak ada air panas sekembalinya kami dari Gili, dan • Sekali lagi, tokek ada di dalam kamar. Meskipun kami memahami bahwa berada di destinasi tropis berarti berinteraksi dengan alam, keberadaan banyak tokek dan salamander di kedua kamar—tanpa peringatan sebelumnya atau indikasi yang jelas bahwa hal ini sudah diperkirakan—sangat mengganggu dan sama sekali tidak mendukung lingkungan profesional dan tenang yang kami bayangkan. Seandainya kami diberitahu sebelumnya tentang gangguan satwa liar seperti itu, kami mungkin akan memesan kamar di tempat lain yang lebih sesuai. Kurangnya transparansi ini mengecewakan dan, sejujurnya, tidak dapat diterima. Kami ditawari pengembalian dana untuk satu malam oleh pihak properti, dengan syarat pengembalian dana diproses melalui Booking.com. (KAMI MASIH BELUM MENERIMA INI DAN ITU HANYA MINIMUM SAJA) Oleh karena itu, kami menghubungi Anda untuk mengajukan keluhan ini secara resmi dan meminta bantuan Anda dalam menemukan penyelesaian yang lebih tepat dan adil. Selain kesulitan dan ketidaknyamanan ini, kami terpaksa memesan akomodasi alternatif untuk satu malam melalui Booking.com karena masalah yang sedang berlangsung di properti tersebut. Saya bersedia memberikan detail dan bukti pemesanan tambahan ini sebagai bagian dari proses penyelesaian keluhan."

Hotel ini tidak berorientasi pada klien dan layanan dari pihak hotel sangat buruk. Kami memesan perjalanan dengan mereka dan berharap untuk mendapatkan tamasya tingkat tinggi karena kami memesan melalui hotel, tetapi itu adalah pengalaman terburuk yang pernah saya terima. Kami ditipu melalui hotel ini 2 kali dengan tamasya. Mereka tidak ingin memberikan detail yang tertulis dalam deskripsi tamasya, mereka memberi kami perahu yang tidak memiliki tangga untuk naik kembali, sepanjang hari tidak ada penyediaan air. Dan mereka tidak ingin membiarkan kami keluar untuk berjalan kaki dari perahu. Kami perlu mengunjungi 3 pulau, tetapi kami hanya mengunjungi 2. Tamasya air terjun juga merupakan skema curang. Jadi jangan memesan tamasya apa pun dengan mereka! Pijat juga lebih baik dan lebih murah di luar hotel. Setelah pengalaman tamasya yang mengerikan, mereka tidak memberikan layanan yang lebih baik untuk kami atau apa pun yang gratis."
"627.","Zsolt P.","228","2025-05-20","1","Meskipun banyak ulasan bintang 5, pengalaman saya sangat negatif dan meninggalkan hotel dengan perasaan yang sangat buruk, terutama karena staf restoran hotel (tidak tertarik pada pekerjaan dan tamu), gadis bar pantai Basilico (memanggil orang asing Barat dengan sebutan bule sangat tidak sopan) dan beberapa staf lobi (berbohong kepada tamu dan memberikan informasi palsu agar tamu merasa lebih baik). Selain layanan yang buruk selama sarapan, sarapan juga bencana, pilihan terbatas dan tidak ada variasi sangat mengecewakan untuk hotel bintang 5... lebih seperti hotel bintang 3. Hotel ini saya pilih juga karena lokasinya yang terpencil yang menjanjikan kedamaian dan relaksasi, tetapi pada hari ke-3 saya di sana, semuanya tidak tenang dan santai karena ada kerumunan 200 orang yang mengadakan pesta 30 meter dari kolam renang, dengan para animator yang berteriak-teriak. Ketika saya bertanya kepada staf lobi berapa lama waktu yang dibutuhkan, jawabannya adalah akan segera berakhir setelah pukul 12 siang padahal mereka tahu bahwa mereka akan istirahat makan siang sekitar pukul 13.30 - 14.00!!! Itu bohong menurutku. Aku hanya bisa memuji para tukang kebun dan petugas kebersihan kamar di kompleks itu dan pemuda yang melayani kami makan malam, semua yang lain tidak tertarik atau bersikap kasar. Maaf, tapi aku jelas tidak akan merekomendasikan hotel ini."

"629.","Ella Taylor","12","2025-01-20","1","Jangan menginap di sini. Hotelnya sangat berisik sehingga kami harus pergi dan membayar hotel baru, selain yang kami bayar untuk hotel ini, hanya untuk keluar dari lubang neraka ini. Kami memesan dan membayar ekstra untuk hotel ini, tetapi mendapatkan kamar twin yang kami pesan pada bulan Juni untuk mengonfirmasi kamar twin dan juga sehari sebelumnya. Kami tiba dan mereka mengatakan tidak ada kamar twin. Tidak ada kompensasi yang ditawarkan. Mereka mencoba memasang tempat tidur berkemah logam untuk anak-anak dengan kasur tipis di dalam kamar. Kami menolaknya karena tidak ada ruang untuk meletakkannya. Kami tetap menginap karena dijanjikan kamar twin untuk malam berikutnya. Kami harus mengingatkan mereka untuk memindahkan barang-barang kami keesokan harinya, tetapi ketika pulang, mereka telah memindahkan barang-barang kami ke kamar keluarga yang memiliki tempat tidur king yang sama dengan kamar sebelumnya, tetapi kamar yang lebih besar dengan tempat tidur berkemah anak-anak di sudut. Kami, orang dewasa, tidak ingin tidur di tempat tidur berkemah logam tipis yang berisik untuk anak-anak, jadi kami harus berbagi tempat tidur lagi. Satu-satunya alasan kami membayar harga tinggi untuk hotel ini adalah karena tempat tidur twin yang tidak disediakan dan tidak ada kompensasi. Kami harus membongkar dan mengemas ulang barang-barang kami dua kali, kami tidak dapat mencuci pakaian karena tidak tahu nomor kamar baru. Kami pergi ke restoran dan ibu saya mendapat ravioli yang setengah matang dan harus dia tinggalkan. Ada banyak serangga di kedua kamar. Kamar tempat kami dipindahkan berada tepat di sebelah bar yang mengeluarkan nyanyian dan musik yang sangat keras hingga pukul 10:00 ketika kami ingin tidur pukul 8 setelah perjalanan panjang. Hotel ini merusak masa tinggal kami di Lombok karena setiap kali kami pulang, suasana hati kami hancur karena kami diingatkan tentang berapa banyak yang telah kami bayar untuk hotel yang mengecewakan dalam segala hal. Kamar kedua memiliki pancuran genggam. Kamar pertama hanya memiliki satu stopkontak. Kamar kedua TV tidak berfungsi. Kolam renangnya jelek, sarapannya mengecewakan dan semua makanan kontinental dipenuhi lalat, staf membiarkan tamu merokok di area sarapan bebas rokok. AC adalah yang terburuk yang kami alami selama di Bali, membuat kami berdua masuk angin. Kami menginap di hotel bintang 3 di Canguu dan Gilli T dan memiliki pengalaman yang jauh lebih baik di kedua hotel ini, hotel yang disebut bintang 5 ini harganya dua kali lipat dan pengalaman terburuk yang kami alami. Sakit kepala sepanjang malam mendengarkan nyanyian yang mengerikan dengan volume penuh yang sangat keras sampai-sampai kepala saya sakit. Rasanya seperti berada di neraka bukan liburan. Harus duduk dengan penyumbat udara terjaga di kamar saya sendiri bahkan ketika hanya berjalan-jalan dan menelepon karena sangat berisik. Kami berdua hanya harus duduk di tempat tidur dengan penyumbat telinga menunggu atau itu berakhir. Bahkan tidak berbunyi pada pukul sepuluh kami harus menelepon dan mengeluh pada pukul 10 lewat. Setelah menulis ini tadi malam, kami kemudian terbangun oleh musik yang meledak begitu keras sehingga kami dapat mendengarnya melalui penyumbat telinga kami pada pukul 6:30 pagi yang membangunkan kami. Bahkan setelah saya menelepon dan meminta mereka mematikannya, kami tidak dapat kembali tidur setelah ini. Ada juga infestasi semut di kamar saya membunuh 8 orang saat keluar dari kamar mandi. Tiga hari liburan kami hancur total saat kami tiba karena kabar buruk tentang kamar dan harus membongkar barang berkali-kali, dan suasana hati kami pun hancur. Keesokan harinya, kami baru tahu kalau kamar kami masih bukan kamar twin, tetapi malah pindah ke kamar yang lebih buruk dengan musik yang membuat kami pusing sepanjang malam. Dan hari ini, kami terlalu lelah untuk menikmati perjalanan sehari karena terbangun pukul 6.30. Kami masih punya dua hari lagi dan ini seperti neraka dunia."
"630.","Andrea Rossi","117","2024-01-20","1","Kami memesan hotel ini untuk menghabiskan beberapa hari bulan madu kami. Lokasi luarnya sempurna, bersih, dan dikelilingi pepohonan hijau. Lokasi yang indah saja tidak cukup. Saya bekerja di hotel, saya tahu cara kerjanya, sayangnya manajemennya buruk. Stafnya tidak terlatih, bahkan tidak terlatih dalam informasi dasar. Benar-benar tidak terorganisir. Kamar yang kami tempati benar-benar hancur, layanan di restoran sangat buruk, dan stafnya tidak bisa berbahasa Inggris. Saya diberitahu bahwa spa buka 24 jam tanpa henti, saya memesan pijat pukul 10.45 pagi dan mereka hampir menyuruh saya pergi karena mereka akan tutup. Restoran Italia palsu, produk berkualitas buruk, dan pizza dengan produk beku, yang jelas bukan pizza Italia. Kami memesan cappuccino saat sarapan dan disajikan setelah 20 menit. Minumannya tidak enak dan dibuat dengan baik. Sejujurnya, untuk harga yang mereka minta, seharusnya mereka memiliki staf yang setidaknya tahu cara membuat cappuccino. Sarapan tutup pukul 11, pukul 10.40 semuanya kosong dan jika sudah habis, Anda tidak bisa makan lagi. Kami pergi ke restoran Indonesia. Mereka hanya punya 1 pelayan untuk semua hidangan di restoran, namanya KETUT. Dia adalah yang terbaik di hotel ini, dia memberi kami layanan terbaik. Tapi sejujurnya, tidak ada yang lain. Kami duduk di meja luar di pantai. Setelah 30 menit, tidak ada pelayan yang datang untuk menanyakan apakah kami ingin memesan, mungkin mereka terlalu sibuk menelepon. Sejujurnya, ini adalah hotel terburuk selama bulan madu saya dan saya juga sangat kecewa."

"632.","Chihiro","5","2024-01-20","1","Kamarnya tidak terlalu buruk. Namun, layanannya tidak berkualitas bintang 5. Saya menginap 2 malam. Setelah dibersihkan, kami tidak mendapatkan fasilitas baru (mis. sampo, sabun mandi, tisu toilet, dll.). Operasional restoran juga sangat buruk. Ketika saya pergi ke restoran di pagi hari, saya ingin memesan hanya 1 mi. Namun, tidak ada staf di stasiun mi. Saya bertanya kepada staf berkali-kali. Namun, tidak ada yang menanggapi pesanan saya. Staf datang ke tempat memasak, tetapi dia tidak mengatakan apa-apa kepada saya. Dia membutuhkan waktu 30 menit untuk menyajikan hanya 1 mi. Saya bertanya mengapa butuh waktu 30 menit untuk memasak. Dia berkata kepada saya, Saya harus memasak untuk teman saya terlebih dahulu. Saya tidak mengerti apa yang dia katakan. Dia adalah staf hotel, tetapi dia tidak bisa bekerja untuk pelanggan. Hotel yang sangat buruk. Ini BUKAN bintang 5."
"633.","Tim R","36","2024-01-20","1","Salah satu pengalaman hotel terburuk yang pernah saya alami. Satu-satunya hal yang baik tentang hotel ini adalah lokasinya, tetapi sebenarnya lokasinya lebih baik, sekitar 10 menit ke utara. Saya telah berkeliling Indonesia selama sebulan, dan sejauh ini ini adalah hotel termahal yang kami tempati dan juga yang terburuk. Pelayanannya sangat lambat, apa pun di hotel harganya sangat mahal menurut standar Indonesia, dan gagasan untuk bersantai di sini terasa seperti lelucon ketika musik diputar keras dari jam 10 pagi sampai jam 10 malam, begitu kerasnya sampai membuat kamar bergetar. Kami diberitahu bahwa ini untuk acara khusus di tempat, tetapi tidak diberitahu sebelumnya dan staf tampaknya tidak peduli bahwa ini berarti kami harus meninggalkan hotel pada siang hari karena pacar saya sakit (ini mungkin akibat sarapan) dan tidak dapat mengatasi kebisingan."

Sayangnya, koktailnya terlalu kuat dan rasanya tidak sesuai harapan. Ketika kami menelepon pelayan untuk mengeluh tentang rasanya, ia memberi tahu kami bahwa selama happy hour mereka menggunakan alkohol lokal Bali (non-sertifikasi). Sesuatu yang ingin kami ketahui sebelumnya! Kami menerima koktail baru tetapi rasanya tetap sama. Sayang sekali untuk tempat mewah ini!"
"635.","Fashya","3","2025-01-20","1","Mereka punya banyak hal yang perlu diperbaiki. Saya sudah menelepon layanan kamar tiga kali, tapi tidak ada yang mengangkat, dan operator bilang mereka akan mencoba menghubungi petugas restoran lewat ponselnya. Seperti... APA? 😅 Menunggu 15 menit sampai mereka menelepon saya kembali, tapi tidak ada jawaban. Sandwich ayamnya cuma ada 4 suwiran ayam kecil di dalamnya, kita tidak bisa menyebutnya sandwich ayam, bro. Meja balkonnya berdebu dan dindingnya kotor. Jujur, siapa yang memberi mereka 5⭐️?? Hotel 5⭐️ tidak seperti ini."

"637.","Sandra Zitzmann","6","2024-01-20","1","Standar bintang dua. Sangat tidak direkomendasikan. Hotel dan kamarnya tidak hanya usang, tetapi juga sangat membutuhkan renovasi. Jamur jelas tumbuh di langit-langit. Fasilitasnya benar-benar terbengkalai. Banyak sampah berserakan. Dek kayunya perlu direnovasi, dan kursi berjemurnya tidak memiliki bantalan yang layak, hanya plastik usang. Stafnya hampir tidak bisa berbahasa Inggris, kecuali beberapa. Sisanya kasar dan hanya membiarkan Anda berdiri di sana tanpa jawaban. Pantainya tidak memiliki kursi berjemur dan tidak ada tempat berteduh. Perahu berlabuh sangat dekat. Sama sekali bukan standar bintang 5. Pijatannya fantastis, tetapi tidak sepadan."
"638.","Kareem Elharony","142","2024-01-20","1","Tempatnya terlihat mewah dan terasa lebih baik, tetapi dalam hal pelayanannya sangat buruk. Anda tidak dapat menemukan orang yang seharusnya membuat payung dan harus berjalan dan bertanya kepada beberapa orang sehingga menimbulkan ketidaknyamanan. Pantainya tidak privat. Siapa pun dipersilakan ke pantai, yang mana kurang baik untuk turis atau penjual yang agresif yang terus menatap Anda saat beristirahat di bawah sinar matahari. Saya tidak mengerti mengapa mereka membiarkannya, mengapa mereka tidak memiliki kebijakan? Tetaplah di tempat biasa atau pergi ke Gilli yang akan terasa lebih nyaman. Saya tidak tahu, apakah normal menemukan Kecoa di kamar mandi hotel bintang 5!!! Banyak barang yang terlihat seperti pelatihan. Kami tidak menyukai pengalaman di sana dan tidak akan pernah mengulanginya."
"639.","邢江龙","2","2025-01-20","1","Ketika saya memesan layanan transportasi ke bandara, dua staf di depan mengatakan harganya 250 ribu, dan mereka membiarkan saya membayar ketika saya tiba di bandara.

Ngomong-ngomong, saya sarapan jam 6, dan sebagian besar makanannya dingin. Dan linennya sudah tua dan menjadi abu-abu. Saya tidak mengerti mengapa mereka tidak menggantinya. Sepertinya mereka sudah menggunakannya sejak 2015. Shengigi sangat indah. Saya akan kembali lagi. Tetapi saya tidak akan pernah memilih hotel yang buruk ini."
"640.","Segolene Charrier","1","2020-01-20","1","Setibanya di resepsionis hotel, kami diberi tahu bahwa reservasi belum terdaftar. Kami menunjukkan konfirmasi kertas yang kami bawa, yang membuktikan sebaliknya. Kemudian kami diberitahu bahwa kami harus membayar deposit sebesar $100 untuk mendapatkan kamar. Kami menunjukkan reservasi kertas kami, yang dengan jelas menyatakan bahwa reservasi, deposit, dan asuransi telah dibayar. Film mulai diputar, dan kartu kredit agensi kami konon belum terbayar. Kami dengan tegas menolak membayar, meminta mereka untuk menghubungi perwakilan agensi setempat; mereka tidak bisa melakukannya!!! 25 menit kemudian, setelah cukup kesal, mencium adanya penipuan, tetapi tetap pada pendirian kami, mereka akhirnya memberi kami kamar. Kamar ini terletak di antara dua area konstruksi (berisik sepanjang hari), dan di malam hari, Anda dapat mendengar suara klub malam... 800 meter dari kamar ke area sarapan, yang menyenangkan setiap pagi... Kamarnya usang, kamar mandinya biasa saja. Stafnya tidak ramah, dan makanan Italia di tempat ini mahal dan kualitasnya biasa saja, meskipun pemandangan tepi pantainya luar biasa indah. Sangat kecewa dengan hotel yang mengiklankan tingkat kemewahan tertentu, tetapi kenyataannya, ternyata menjadi mesin bisnis besar tanpa minat atau sentuhan manusia. Kami tidak merekomendasikannya."
"641.","Heiko Wirtz","28","2024-01-20","1","Pada dasarnya hotel yang solid, tetapi jika Anda mempertimbangkan bahwa hotel ini memiliki 5 bintang, maka itu benar-benar di bawah standar. Kompleks ini, yang memiliki banyak potensi, sayangnya kotor dan rusak. Ada sampah berserakan di mana-mana. Kamar-kamarnya juga sayangnya sangat kuno dan jelas perlu direnovasi. Sarapannya juga tidak enak sama sekali, hanya lumayan. Ketika kami ingin berbaring di tepi kolam renang, itu tidak hanya kotor, tetapi juga ada acara dengan lebih dari 100 orang dan musik yang sangat keras TEPAT di sebelah kolam renang. Tidak ada pertanyaan tentang relaksasi. Kami kemudian mengeluh dan dibawa ke kolam renang pribadi untuk tamu lain. Tetapi di sini juga kami sangat kecewa: semuanya sangat rusak dan kolam renangnya kotor. Sungguh disayangkan, kompleks ini benar-benar memiliki banyak potensi, karena tepat di tepi laut. Juga, mungkin seluruh staf harus dikerahkan untuk membersihkan kompleks."
"642.","Eleonora Costantini","17","2025-01-20","1","Mengerikan. Mereka tidak berbicara bahasa Inggris sama sekali dan bahkan menatap Anda saat Anda bertanya. Restorannya mengerikan dan staf resepsionis sama sekali tidak membantu. Jauhi tempat ini."
"643.","Dian Puspita Sari","157","2021-01-20","1","Area resor ini luas dan indah, terletak di tanjung Pantai Senggigi. Lokasinya sangat strategis di Senggigi dengan antrean pantai yang panjang, tempat Anda dapat berjalan-jalan di pagi hari atau sambil menunggu matahari terbenam di sore hari. Sarapannya lumayan. Namun, pelayanannya buruk dan cara mereka menangani masalah check-in sangat buruk. Jadi, kami memesan paket 'back to travel' secara online dari Agen Perjalanan Online (OTA). Paket ini menawarkan beberapa keuntungan termasuk paket COVID-19, sewa sepeda gratis untuk 2 orang, diskon untuk barbekyu, minuman selamat datang di kamar, dll. Saat kami check-in, resepsionis mengatakan tidak ada paket tersebut, jadi kami hanya mendapatkan kamar. Suami saya meminta untuk berbicara dengan manajer tentang masalah ini, dan resepsionis menghubungkan kami dengan Bapak DXXI yang katanya bertanggung jawab atas pemesanan. Beliau menanggapi keluhan kami dengan acuh tak acuh, mengatakan bahwa kami harus menghubungi OTA daripada mengeluh ke hotel. Dia juga menyebutkan bahwa kamar dengan pemandangan taman, kamar yang kami pesan, adalah kamar TERMURAH yang tersedia. Kami merasa sangat tidak sopan dan memalukan. Kamar dengan pemandangan taman adalah satu-satunya tipe kamar yang ditawarkan dalam paket tersebut. Pada titik ini, masalahnya bukan hanya pada paketnya, tetapi lebih pada bagaimana mereka memperlakukan tamu yang memesan paket secara online. Kami masih merasa tidak puas, tetapi kami meninggalkan resepsionis dan menuju kamar kami. Suami saya menghubungi layanan pelanggan OTA dan mengeluh tentang paket tersebut. Dua jam kemudian, setelah suami saya memeriksa situs web hotel dan menemukan paket yang sama, paket kembali ke perjalanan beserta manfaatnya yang disebutkan di situs web, kami kembali ke resepsionis dan meminta untuk bertemu dengan manajer. Singkat cerita, setelah berbicara dengan asisten manajer (seorang wanita), dan manajer itu sendiri, mereka dengan berat hati meminta maaf tentang paket tersebut dan tentang bagaimana Tuan DXXI memperlakukan kami, tetapi tetap saja, mereka tidak dapat memberikan beberapa manfaat karena COVID-19 (khususnya: minuman selamat datang - di dalam kamar). Saya tidak habis pikir, kenapa mereka menawarkan 'Paket Kembali ke Perjalanan', yang saya duga, untuk mendorong orang-orang menginap di hotel selama pandemi ini, jika mereka tidak bisa memberikan manfaat yang dijanjikan karena pandemi COVID-19. Asisten manajer wanita itu juga bilang kalau kami tidak mendapatkan semua manfaatnya karena harga OTA yang kami bayar untuk paket tersebut di bawah harga Hotel di situs web. Saya mengapresiasi alasan mereka yang konyol itu. Diskon untuk barbekyu katanya diubah menjadi diskon untuk restoran karena barbekyu tidak tersedia hari itu, dan mereka sama sekali lupa membahas tentang hampers. Asisten manajer wanita itu juga berulang kali mengingatkan kami kalau bersepeda hanya untuk dua jam, tidak lebih (sangat baik). Aduh! Itu membuat saya jadi malas (lagi). Saya tadinya tidak suka bersepeda, tapi sebelumnya, saya senang juga punya pilihan. Suami saya bertanya kepada manajer tentang bagaimana restoran bisa tahu kalau kami mendapat diskon. Manajer menjawab bahwa kami akan mendapatkan kupon untuk ditunjukkan ke restoran, tetapi sampai kami meninggalkan hotel, kupon itu tidak diberikan. Intinya, apa keuntungan yang kami dapatkan dari paket tersebut? Tidak ada, kecuali masalah saat check-in, tanggapan dan komentar kasar dari staf (terutama Tuan DXXI dan asisten manajer wanita) dan permintaan maaf yang tidak tulus. Kami pasti tidak akan kembali ke hotel ini."

Sedangkan disini, kami diberi kupon welcome drink di sunset bar, harus berjalan ke sunset bar dan menunggu >20 menit untuk welcome drink, itupun baru disajikan setelah kami tanyakan lagi mana welcome drinknya (padahal kupon sudah diberikan). Jam 14.00, masih juga tidak ada staff yang menjemput. Akhirnya berinisiatif menelepon receptionist, ternyata kamar sudah siap dan kami diminta untuk ke lobby. Hahaha. Karena awalnya dibilang akan dijemput, kami minta dijemput, tapi tidak ada yg datang setelah menunggu cukup lama, akhirnya kami pun berjalan ke lobby sambil lihat2 review di google.

Kedua, mereka menyajikan teh dan kopi dingin selama sesi. Masalah yang saya alami selama menginap adalah AC kamar tidak berfungsi, dan mereka bersikeras memperbaikinya hingga tiga kali. Setiap kali mereka mengklaim telah memperbaikinya, saya harus kembali ke kamar untuk memeriksanya. Sungguh buang-buang waktu selama menginap bisnis!

"705.","Yasmin Afina","107","2025-07-20","2","Secara keseluruhan, pengalaman saya campur aduk. Saya menginap di sana semalam bersama keluarga dan tempatnya indah. Hotel ini terletak di taman yang luas dan terawat dengan baik, jadi dari segi itu, tempat ini benar-benar menyenangkan untuk berjalan-jalan. Hotel itu sendiri memiliki banyak potensi meskipun relatif tua, kamar-kamarnya tetap nyaman. Saya rasa masalah utamanya adalah manajemen dan pelayanannya. Saat sarapan, tempatnya sangat ramai - meskipun staf memeriksa kami untuk sarapan, mereka langsung mempersilakan kami masuk tanpa memastikan apakah ada meja untuk kami. Sebenarnya ada lebih banyak kamar daripada kapasitas untuk sarapan; mungkin manajemen harus mempertimbangkan untuk mengizinkan restoran kedua digunakan untuk sarapan juga. Stafnya tidak membantu dan pada akhirnya keluarga kami harus berpencar, yang cukup merusak suasana. Makanan biasa saja, banyak yang tampaknya tidak segar/dingin. Kolam renangnya sebenarnya sangat kecil dan tepat di depan area sarapan yang membuatnya agak canggung, terutama mengingat betapa luasnya properti ini. Ngomong-ngomong, sepertinya ada semacam acara perusahaan yang berlangsung di taman, tepat di sebelah area sarapan, di mana mereka memutar musik yang *sangat* keras sehingga membuat suasana tidak menyenangkan. Petugas di kolam renang yang mengurus handuk juga sangat judes meskipun tidak ada orang lain yang meminta handuk kepadanya. Pantai lumayan meskipun agak kotor, dengan banyak orang yang berjualan dan dengan cepat mengerumuni kami sehingga sulit untuk menikmati waktu kami di pantai sepenuhnya. Semua masalah ini dapat diatasi dengan satu atau lain cara dan akan sangat berpengaruh jika ditangani oleh manajemen hotel yang memiliki banyak pesona dan potensi."
"706.","Carmen Leuther","12","2025-09-20","2","Salah satu pengalaman menginap terburuk yang pernah kami alami. Bungalow dan layanan tata graha mereka bagus. (Itulah mengapa mereka memberi kami dua bintang.) Staf di resepsionis dan di restoran Basilico bahkan lebih buruk lagi. Kami merasa tidak dihargai sebagai tamu. Untuk menyewa bola basket, mereka meminta 65.000 rupiah per jam. Tapi akhirnya kami membayar 85.000 dan 95.000 rupiah. (Dua harga berbeda, untuk bola yang sama dan waktu yang sama.) Saya belum pernah melihat begitu banyak karyawan di resepsionis atau di restoran bermain ponsel. Sulit untuk tidur di akomodasi ini. Suatu pagi, ada pertunjukan motor yang sangat bising di halaman pukul 6 pagi, dan keesokan paginya, dari pukul 6 hingga 8 pagi, ada pesta yang sangat bising. Tingkat kebisingannya sangat mengganggu! Kami tidak menemukan informasi apa pun tentang hal itu di kamar kami atau di tempat lain! Di restoran, pelayannya langsung membuang sampah di meja ke pasir. Tak ada kata-kata. Sayangnya, kami tidak merekomendasikannya, dan kami tidak akan kembali."
"707.","mister s","17","2025-07-20","2","Saat tiba, hotel ini tampak indah. Stafnya sangat ramah. Sarapannya beragam, dengan pilihan untuk semua orang. Namun, kamar sangat membutuhkan renovasi. Ada jamur di kamar mandi, cat mengelupas, retakan di langit-langit, pintu yang menganga, tidak ada stop kontak di samping tempat tidur dan hanya satu di dekat meja dengan adaptor 3 soket. Tidak ada saklar lampu di dalam (Anda harus menyeberangi ruangan dalam gelap untuk menyalakan lampu), toiletnya longgar (saya hendak membersihkannya, dan kemudian seluruh mangkuk toilet ikut terlepas), pegangan tangga di belakang sudah lapuk (saya meraihnya, dan langsung terlepas). Ubin lantai hilang di seluruh area kolam renang (saya berjalan di atasnya dan tiba-tiba merasakan tepi yang tajam, diikuti oleh tepi yang lebih tajam lagi, dan kemudian saya melihat ubinnya hilang). Saya juga merasa sangat memalukan bahwa saya harus membayar €90.750 untuk milkshake stroberi dan €117.000 untuk bir Bintang ukuran besar. Saya belum melihat daftar harganya, tetapi saya menantikannya. Jadi setelah selesai, saya harus membayar. Di tempat lain di Senggigi, Anda membayar 45.000 untuk keduanya. Saya mengerti mungkin sedikit lebih mahal, tetapi ini lebih dari dua kali lipat. Saya pikir jika Anda mengklaim sebagai hotel bintang 5, hal ini seharusnya tidak terjadi. Selain itu, ini adalah hotel yang bagus, dan pelayanan stafnya jelas merupakan nilai tambah. Tetapi hotel ini jelas tidak layak mendapatkan peringkat bintang 5."
"708.","Marcel Franssen","2","2025-06-20","2","Lokasinya indah, tetapi resor ini perlu meningkatkan layanannya. Layanannya sangat buruk. Bar pantai harus menunggu staf selama 25 menit. Bahasa Inggris staf restoran buruk, jadi sulit menjelaskan apa yang ingin Anda makan."
"709.","복","16","2026-01-13","2","1. Saya melaporkan adanya tikus yang merayap di kamar tidur saya, tetapi tidak ada tindakan yang diambil. 2. Saya memesan dua kamar untuk keluarga saya dan berkunjung tiga hari sebelumnya untuk meminta agar kami ditempatkan di bungalow yang sama. Namun, mereka menggunakan alasan bahwa ada banyak tamu pada hari itu untuk menempatkan kami di kamar yang berjauhan. Dan mereka sama sekali tidak tampak meminta maaf."
"710.","Alfons Tanujaya","196","2025-07-20","2","Tiba larut malam hanya untuk mengetahui bahwa hotel tidak memiliki gym. Dan sekarang AC Daikin tidak berfungsi, sudah diputar maksimal tetapi tetap terasa panas. Ingin menghubungi resepsionis tetapi kami sudah berkemas dan lelah. Mari kita lihat kamar besok karena kami akan menginap 4 hari di sini. Ada beberapa nyamuk di kamar mandi dan putri saya tidak bisa tidur karena dia melihat beberapa cicak 😅 di dekat tempat tidurnya. Air panasnya sempurna, area resornya luas. Kecepatan internetnya luar biasa 100 Mbps upload dan download."
"711.","Pierre Jadot","216","2025-07-20","2","Hotelnya tampak indah dari luar, dengan ruang-ruang indah yang menghadap ke laut. Sambutannya sangat profesional dan ramah. Di dalam, kondisinya memburuk: kamarnya tidak terlalu luas atau terang, belum lagi kebersihannya yang patut dipertanyakan (berjamur, jendela kotor, dll.)."
"712.","Tom Simes","11","2025-01-20","2","Kami tiba kemarin pukul 2 siang. Panas dan lelah. Anak muda yang ramah itu tidak tahu harus mengambil tas kami dari taksi. Kamar kami belum siap. Dan mereka salah mencatat pemesanan kamar dan lama menginap. Kami menunggu satu jam. Saya harus meminta minuman dingin beberapa kali. TV tidak berfungsi. Kulkas mengeluarkan suara keras sepanjang malam. Bantal terlalu tinggi dan sangat tidak nyaman. Hotel ini SANGAT kumuh!! Pantainya lumayan - tidak terlalu bersih. Tidak ada yang bisa dilihat atau dilakukan di dekatnya. Pasar yang sangat kumuh berjarak 10 menit berjalan kaki. Sarapannya enak. Banyak pilihan. Meskipun butuh 15 menit untuk cappuccino datang, karena kopi prasmanannya mengerikan. Tehnya suam-suam kuku. Kentang goreng dari restoran dan setengah dingin. PAJAK 25% di atas harga!! Saya belum pernah melihat itu sebelumnya: harga setara dengan Sydney! Stafnya muda, ramah, membantu, tetapi cukup tidak berguna: tidak tahu apa yang mereka lakukan, layanan pelanggan sangat buruk, dll. Saya tidak akan merekomendasikan Lombok atau hotel ini sama sekali."
"713.","Oleander","262","2025-01-20","2","Sebenarnya cukup bagus, bisa dibilang satu-satunya lokasi di pantai ini yang direkomendasikan. Namun, layanannya sangat perlu pelatihan. Waktu tunggunya sangat lama. Waktu sampai kami mendapatkan minuman kami sangat lama. Makanan yang kami pesan benar-benar terlupakan. Bahkan ketika kami bertanya, tidak ada makanan yang disajikan, terlupakan lagi. Setelah menunggu lebih dari satu jam, kami membayar makanan kami dan meninggalkan lokasi. Stafnya benar-benar kewalahan, tidak terlatih, dan tidak terorganisir. Ini masalah manajemen."
"714.","John Van Waterschoot","12","2025-01-20","2","Hotelnya ketinggalan jaman, kurang perawatan, seperti kamar mandi berjamur, dll. Ini lebih seperti pusat konferensi. Pernikahan diadakan dimana kelompok melakukan aktivitasnya pada pukul 6:45 pagi dengan musik keras melalui speaker besar. Ditambah lagi teriakan melalui mikrofon. Kelompok besar mengambil tempat di restoran, misalnya, dan oleh karena itu kualitas makanannya buruk. Anda membayar 60.000 r.p (€3,20) untuk 1 cangkir cappuccino. Pantai di sebelah hotel penuh dengan banyak plastik. Kami mulai membersihkan diri, tetapi kami tidak menerima kantong plastik apa pun dari hotel. Senggigi setengah kosong dan bobrok. Jalanan dan terutama saluran drainase penuh dengan kantong plastik sampah masyarakat. Singkatnya, jangan datang ke sini!!"
"715.","Karsten Kirchner","8","2025-01-20","2","Hotel ini jelas bukan bintang 4. 2* lebih tepat menggambarkannya. Dibangun pada akhir 1980-an, hotel ini kumuh, dengan toilet yang tidak menarik, pantai dengan pembatas beton, dan restoran yang benar-benar buruk. Kami langsung pergi karena kami ingin dan membayar untuk hotel bintang 4."
"716.","Agnes Los","22","2025-01-20","2","Sangat ketinggalan jaman, jelas tidak layak mendapat 5 bintang... tapi 2 bintang. Kami menginap di sini selama 3 malam. Suatu malam kami menunggu hampir 2 jam untuk makanan. Sarapannya enak dan banyak pilihan. Pantainya kurang bagus, banyak sampah dan kotoran. Namun, orang-orangnya sangat ramah. Kami tidak akan menginap lagi."
"717.","Azmi Ahmad Hazimi","145","2025-01-20","2","Renovasi diperlukan. Perlu strategi yang lebih baik untuk tetap mempertahankan layanan bahkan selama jam sibuk dengan reservasi grup. Butuh variasi makanan untuk sarapan. Layanan sarapan yang lebih baik sangat dibutuhkan."
"718.","Maher Banjar","301","2025-09-20","2","Tidak puas Tapi resepsionis sangat membantu dan kooperatif dengan pelanggan"
"719.","Hiba Ahmad","3","2024-01-20","2","Kami hanya masuk ke pantai pribadi dan restoran. Minumannya gula murni, meskipun kami memesan jus dan es kopi, tapi rasanya sangat buruk sehingga kami tidak bisa meminumnya. Kami memesan pizza, dan rasanya juga tidak enak meskipun harganya sangat mahal. Kami ingin ke pantai pribadi. Setelah bertanya ke resepsionis, mereka bilang kami boleh masuk dan memesan sesuatu dari restoran. Namun, sesampainya di restoran, kami dilarang menggunakan kursi berjemur kecuali membayar ekstra. Ombaknya sangat kuat sehingga tidak ada yang bisa berenang, dan kami kemudian tahu bahwa sebagian besar waktu, kita tidak bisa berenang di sini. Itu buang-buang waktu dan uang."
"720.","Jana Gm","15","2024-01-20","2","Kompleksnya sangat indah dan kamar-kamarnya luas. Stafnya sangat ramah. Sayangnya, sarapannya hanya untuk kelas menengah ke bawah, kalaupun ada. Saat barbekyu di restoran hotel, saya disuguhi ayam mentah. Rupanya, pemanggangannya tidak direncanakan, dan akibatnya, sate ayamnya tidak matang sempurna, yang membuat saya mual. Secara keseluruhan, kami tidak merasakan perbedaan apa pun dibandingkan dengan hotel bintang 2 yang pernah kami inapi sebelumnya, yang harganya hanya setengahnya."
"721.","Ørnulf Olsen","2","2024-01-20","2","Kebersihan kamar di bawah standar bintang lima, dan kamar mandi saya tidak dibersihkan selama 3 hari. Baunya seperti ada yang merokok di dalam kamar, meskipun kamar bebas asap rokok. Harga restorannya terlalu mahal dibandingkan dengan layanannya. Anda akan menemukan restoran yang lebih baik di dekat sini."
"722.","Ronald","1427","2020-01-20","2","Hotel bintang 3 (bukan bintang 4) yang indah di tanjung dengan taman yang indah di sekitarnya, kolam renang, dan pantai pribadi. Hotel ini terdiri dari beberapa bangunan: lobi, restoran, bangunan dengan 1 hingga 8 kamar hotel, toko suvenir, ATM, dan layanan pijat. Hotel ini juga memiliki lapangan tenis, sekolah menyelam, layanan handuk, dan kursi pantai di pantai pribadi (penjual dan tukang pijat tidak diperbolehkan di pantai pribadi dan hanya diperbolehkan duduk di tepi pantai). Teluk di depan hotel memiliki pantai berpasir, tetapi snorkeling dan berselancar sangat menyenangkan, tepat di lepas pantai. Ada agen perjalanan yang sangat baik di taman (yang mengatur perjalanan wisata lengkap dengan sopir yang baik). Populer di kalangan Muslim: wanita berpakaian hitam dan burka di tepi kolam renang. Dan pada pukul 5:00 pagi, Anda akan terbangun oleh suara masjid. Kamar hotel yang kuno menyerupai pondok pantai yang megah. Anda tidak perlu khawatir dengan kaki berpasir atau tokek di kamar Anda. Kamar mandi yang kuno dan kecil memiliki wastafel, pancuran yang baik, dan toilet (sulit disiram). Kamar tidur dengan tempat tidur empuk, AC yang bising, dan kamar-kamar yang bising. Di akhir pekan, dentuman disko di dekatnya dapat terdengar mengganggu hingga larut malam. Lingkungan sekitar: bangunan-bangunan bobrok dan banyak sampah. Berbagai restoran lokal dan penyewaan taksi juga tersedia di dekatnya. Jaraknya lebih dari satu jam berkendara dari bandara. Di sebelah hotel terdapat Kila Pool Villages. Rumah-rumah liburan ini memiliki kolam renang berbentuk pita biru. Hotelnya bagus (dan terlihat bagus di foto), tetapi kamar-kamarnya tidak layak mendapat peringkat bintang 4."
"723.","Fab C","1492","2019-01-20","2","Resor MURAH yang berusaha tampil berkelas, tetapi tidak tahu caranya. Keluhan (mengingat biaya kamar setara dengan sekitar 1 bulan gaji lokal) 1. Minuman selamat datang saat kamar disiapkan terbatas pada 1 rasa minuman bersoda lokal. Saya sedang dalam pemulihan dari keracunan makanan ketika tiba dan meminta jus semangka atau sebotol air, tetapi ditolak. 2. Kamar kami berjarak 20 meter dari tempat check-in, tetapi porter membawa kami melalui rute panjang sekitar 150 meter di bawah sinar matahari agar terlihat lebih panjang untuk mendapatkan tip. 3. Pintu kamar mandi rusak dan tidak bisa dikunci. 4. Gantungan handuk longgar dan berbahaya. 5. Tempat tidur twin adalah yang terkecil yang pernah saya lihat di luar hostel. 6. Kulkas besar berdinding kaca di kamar sangat berisik sehingga harus dimatikan untuk tidur dan minumannya terlalu mahal mengingat harga kamar. 7. Satu-satunya restoran di Lombok yang saya kunjungi dengan pajak dan biaya layanan sebesar 21%. 8. Musik kencang dimulai tepat sebelum matahari terbenam, memainkan lagu-lagu cover yang buruk, menghilangkan kesempatan untuk menikmati matahari terbenam yang romantis atau damai. Saking kerasnya, suaranya bisa terdengar hingga 200 meter di ujung pantai. Memiliki staf yang terlatih untuk bersikap sopan dan memperhatikan Anda setiap kali bertemu tidak menjadikan resor ini berkelas. Satu-satunya hal yang bagus adalah sarapannya, atau mungkin akan diberi peringkat 1 bintang."

"725.","Eliane Brunner","91","2018-01-20","2","Sayangnya, masa inap kami di Kila Senggigi Beach Lombok sangat mengecewakan. Kami tidak mendapatkan kamar yang dijanjikan, dan bungalow yang kami tempati sangat tua. Pintunya tidak tertutup rapat, dan kami menghabiskan malam dengan tokek. Kamar mandinya sangat gelap, dan pancurannya sangat kecil, tanpa tempat penyimpanan sampo, dll. Hanya pancuran luar ruangannya yang bagus. Suasananya juga sangat bising di malam hari karena Ramadan, dan mulai pukul 6 pagi, kami dibangunkan oleh suara sepeda motor. Kolam renangnya sangat kecil, dan pantainya sangat sepi karena penjualnya yang agresif. Stafnya sangat ramah, tetapi kami tidak akan memesannya lagi."
"726.","Henk Sio","6","2024-01-20","2","Kami ada di sana bersama beberapa pasangan lain, tetapi sayangnya, ada konferensi besar yang berlangsung pada saat yang bersamaan. Karena itu, semua pilihan makan siang dan makan malam disediakan untuk tamu konferensi; tidak ada tempat untuk kami!"
"727.","Jakob Chmil","4","2018-01-20","2","Kamar mandinya tua dan kurang terawat; misalnya, kepala pancuran berjamur, begitu pula nat pancurannya. Kamar-kamarnya juga berbau aneh. Selebihnya, kamar-kamar dilengkapi dengan TV, AC, dan kulkas. Area luar ruangan terawat baik, begitu pula kolam renangnya. Terdapat juga bar pantai, lapangan tenis, akses langsung ke pantai, ATM, toko swalayan kecil, dan restoran untuk sarapan, makan siang, dan makan malam. Untuk alasan-alasan yang disebutkan di atas (didukung oleh foto-foto), saya menyarankan untuk tidak memesan hotel ini, karena harganya cukup mahal, dengan banderol harga yang lumayan tinggi hingga €120."
"728.","Ignasi Queralt Maymó","19","2020-01-20","2","Pantai yang bagus, tapi tidak untuk orang-orang di dalamnya... mereka merekam atau memotret gadis-gadis Barat, cukup persuasif dalam menjual barang dan banyak yang percaya. Namun, pantai dan pemandangannya luar biasa."

Minta di jemput di resto sejak sebelum adzan maghrib, menunggu lama sampai 30 menit lebih boogie tidak datang2 , akhirnya kebetulan ada boogie lewat saya cegat minta tolong diantar.. ketika diatas boogie ternyata front officenya baru menghubungi petugas boogienya ketika kami di atas boogie dan petugas boogie mengakui bahwa sampai saat itu tidak ada yang menghubungi kalau ada tamu yang perlu penjemputan. Ketika check out pun menunggu boogie hampir 45 menit. Dan kami harus konfirmasi terlebih dahulu. Padahal alangkah lebih baiknya bila memang sedang full kami diberitahukan sebelumnya jadi ngga menunggu lama. Ketika check in dan check out tempatnya berbeda.

"813.","Alberto RM","97","2025-11-20","3","Resor ini luar biasa, sangat indah, meskipun agak kumuh di beberapa tempat. Kamar-kamarnya nyaman tetapi agak ketinggalan zaman, terutama kamar mandinya, yang sangat perlu direnovasi. Rumah kami memiliki pancuran luar ruangan, yang sangat menyenangkan untuk digunakan. Restoran hotel kurang memuaskan: mahal, makanannya biasa-biasa saja, dan pelayanannya buruk. Kami tiba di hari Minggu, dan pantainya kotor dan penuh dengan penduduk setempat yang mengenakan burka, sehingga sangat tidak nyaman bagi para wanita untuk berenang dengan nyaman karena tatapan tidak suka dari penduduk setempat. Orang-orang sudah memberi tahu kami bahwa daerah tersebut sedang mengalami kemunduran dan telah menjadi surga bagi pariwisata lokal, jadi kami merasa tidak nyaman sama sekali dan pergi dua hari lebih awal. Berjalan di jalan menuju hotel terasa sangat tidak aman, terutama bagi para wanita di rombongan kami ketika mereka berjalan sendirian, karena pelecehan dan tatapan sinis dari beberapa orang di sana. Di jalan yang sama, ada juga beberapa restoran yang makanannya lezat dengan harga setengah dari harga restoran hotel."
"814.","Mu Ahmed","27","2025-09-20","3","Lokasi yang indah dan potensi yang luar biasa. Dulunya bintang 5, mungkin di tahun 90-an. Saran: - kamarnya terlalu kuno, terutama toiletnya. - makanannya bisa lebih bervariasi, agak membosankan setelah beberapa hari menginap. - kami terbangun karena ada yang mengetuk pintu tengah malam dan stafnya sama sekali tidak peduli. - area pantai sebagian besar penuh dengan sampah. - harus membayar untuk menggunakan sepeda dan lapangan tenis."
"815.","G E","608","2025-11-20","3","Akan ada banyak orang yang ingin menunjukkan perahu mereka dan memesan tempat untuk Kepulauan Gili. Saya memesan 1 juta untuk snorkeling dan tur pulau. Keesokan harinya, perahu tua yang berbeda datang dan saya tidak punya pilihan selain melanjutkan tur. Banyak orang akan meminta-minta. Anda harus berhati-hati dan memilih perahu yang tepat. Biaya tur pulau hanya sekitar 700.000. Anda perlu menawar. Semuanya mahal di Lombok. Taksi untuk berkeliling juga mahal. Lebih dari 4 hari di Lombok sudah cukup. Pantai-pantainya biasa saja menurut pengamatan saya. Saat snorkeling, hati-hati dengan gigitan ubur-ubur."
"816.","Alex W","27","2025-09-20","3","Kami menginap di hotel sebagai bagian dari tur yang diselenggarakan oleh agen perjalanan. Halaman hotel sangat indah dan luas, dan tanaman hijau dirawat setiap hari. Stafnya ramah, membantu, dan pelayanannya secara umum sangat baik. Namun, kami tidak menginap di kamar kami (dengan pemandangan taman), yang menurut kami agak kuno. Kamar mandinya, khususnya, masih banyak kekurangan (termasuk jamur). Setelah beberapa kali bolak-balik (kami mencoba lima akomodasi berbeda), kami mendapatkan peningkatan kamar (kamar dengan pemandangan laut), tetapi kami harus pindah dua kali karena kurangnya ketersediaan, dan sayangnya masalah kamar mandi masih berlanjut. Peringatan spoiler: Brankas dapat dengan mudah dikeluarkan dari lemari! Secara keseluruhan, Anda akan segera menyadari bahwa kompleks ini berusia hampir 40 tahun dan beberapa pekerjaan renovasi/modernisasi sudah terlambat. Sarapan prasmanan yang bervariasi disajikan dalam wadah yang sebagian rusak, sarung kursi dan kursi malas sangat kotor meskipun ada fasilitas cuci, kolam renang tanpa ubin, kabel listrik dari lampu sorot yang hilang menggantung di air (!), beberapa payung rusak, dll. Sayangnya, pantai pribadi yang diiklankan di situs web tidak ada di mana pun, apalagi kursi malas dan payung di pantai. Sebaliknya, hamparan pantai/laut yang sangat indah di sepanjang area hotel sayangnya penuh sampah, yang tentu saja bukan salah hotel. Di sisi lain, snorkelingnya luar biasa :) Kesimpulan: Merumatta dirancang dengan indah, tetapi menurut saya, standarnya lebih seperti bintang 3. Dengan sedikit usaha dan perhatian terhadap detail, kami bisa dengan mudah mendapatkan pengalaman menginap yang lebih baik. Jika Anda bisa menerima poin-poin ini, saya bisa merekomendasikan hotel ini. P.S. Tidak banyak yang bisa dilakukan di kota ini, dan banyak hal terlihat agak kumuh."
"817.","Ilie NAKSZYNSKI","62","2025-08-20","3","Agak lusuh jika dilihat dari fasilitas dan dekorasinya. Namun Anda selalu dapat mengandalkan layanan yang sangat baik dan sentuhan pribadi. Bisa dibilang lokasi terbaik untuk hotel mana pun di Lombok. Sangat disayangkan hampir semua toko wisata di dekatnya sudah tidak beroperasi lagi."
"818.","Patrick Sylvain","167","2025-07-20","3","Saya menerima layanan yang sangat baik. Namun, hotel ini memang sangat bagus sebelumnya. Saat ini, pemeliharaannya kurang dan foto-fotonya tidak mencerminkan penampilan hotel saat ini. Dengan harga ini, saya yakin ada yang lebih baik. Pemeliharaannya kurang. Lokasinya strategis di Senggigi. Saya menikmati happy hour-nya."
"819.","Mike S.","196","2025-06-20","3","Hotel ini sangat bagus, dekat dengan banyak restoran. Namun, hotel ini bukan hotel bintang 5 - tidak ada pusat kebugaran, yang wajib untuk hotel bintang 5. Kamar-kamarnya luas, lengkap, dan tempat tidurnya nyaman meskipun agak keras. Namun, kamar-kamarnya usang, kamar mandinya perlu direnovasi. Pilihan sarapannya terbatas, dan makanannya biasa saja. Makan di sana lebih dari 3 hari rasanya mustahil."
"820.","Penelope Hierons","22","2025-01-20","3","Jelas bukan hotel bintang 5 bagi saya. Sisi positifnya, vila dengan kolam renang luas dan sungguh menyenangkan bisa berenang langsung dari teras. Lokasinya bagus dan Anda bisa berjalan kaki ke supermarket, panti pijat, dan restoran. Areanya terawat dengan sangat baik dan kecuali jika hotel sedang mengadakan acara (ada dua acara saat kami menginap, salah satunya adalah konser yang selesai tepat sebelum pukul 1 dini hari), tempat ini cukup tenang. Sisi negatifnya, semuanya tua dan agak rusak. Tirai jendela tidak menutup, pintu kamar mandi tidak menutup, ada ubin yang hilang atau longgar di sekitar area kolam renang. Stafnya ramah tetapi tidak terlalu efisien. Email tentang transportasi dari bandara diabaikan dan butuh waktu lama untuk mengambil tas kami di pagi terakhir. Kami menikmati masa inap kami tetapi tidak akan terburu-buru kembali."
"821.","elyse le pair","18","2025-01-20","3","Kamarnya bagus, tapi agak kuno. Kami menginap di sini saat akhir pekan, dan ada acara yang dimulai pukul 7 pagi. Suasananya sangat bising, dan berlangsung sepanjang pagi :( Stafnya sangat sopan, dan fasilitasnya juga lengkap (restoran, sarapan). Sayangnya, kolam renang panjang yang mereka promosikan bersifat privat sehingga tidak bisa diakses oleh tamu biasa. Selain itu, jalan menuju jalan yang ramai dan menyenangkan agak terpencil."
"822.","emmanuelle perreux","4","2025-01-20","3","Hotel ini terletak di Pantai Senggigi, dengan pemandangan yang sangat indah, taman yang megah, dan bungalow yang menawan. Staf yang ramah. Kekurangan utama: kebisingan. Hotel ini menyelenggarakan hiburan lokal di tepi pantai dengan musik (3 acara dalam 4 hari). Mustahil untuk tetap berada di tepi pantai selama waktu-waktu tersebut. Tamu tidak diinformasikan sebelumnya. Anda terpaksa mundur ke kolam renang yang agak kecil dan ikut serta dalam kemeriahan yang terorganisir, lengkap dengan pidato, nyanyian, dan musik yang tidak selalu harmonis. Makanannya lumayan tapi mahal, sementara di Pantai Senggigi terdapat restoran lokal yang sangat menyenangkan, sangat bagus, dan sangat terjangkau. Kekurangan lainnya: area tepi pantainya kuno, tidak selalu bersih, dan kurang terawat oleh pengelola. Anda harus meminta kursi berjemur, dan hanya ada dua payung, yang tidak diragukan lagi karena pantai ini diprioritaskan untuk hiburan lokal! Sungguh disayangkan. Namun, Teluk Senggigi sangat indah dan sangat populer di kalangan penduduk setempat, yang sangat ramah dan mudah diajak mengobrol. Sungguh tempat yang luar biasa."
"823.","Justus Kaspareit","3","2025-01-20","3","Pertama-tama: Dengan harga yang sangat terjangkau, Anda tidak bisa terlalu banyak mengeluh. Oleh karena itu, kami tidak mengharapkan standar bintang 5 Eropa. Meskipun demikian, hotel ini mengiklankan dirinya sebagai hotel bintang 5, tetapi kenyataannya kurang memuaskan di beberapa area. Kamar-kamarnya memadai tetapi terlihat sudah agak usang (yang juga terlihat pada foto). Area hotel yang luas dan indah, tetapi bahkan di sana pun, beberapa tanda penuaan terlihat jelas. Staf selalu membantu, tetapi kami mengalami banyak kesalahpahaman karena kendala bahasa. Sarapan cukup baik, dan meskipun hotel ini tidak banyak dikunjungi oleh tamu internasional, hotel ini menawarkan pilihan sarapan yang lebih bergaya Eropa daripada banyak hotel lain. Secara keseluruhan, kami cukup puas dengan harganya, tetapi lebih seperti kamar bintang 3 di lingkungan bintang 4."
"824.","Ross Wortham","46","2025-01-20","3","Kami menginap di Merumatta selama 6 malam di bulan September. Kami memilih untuk memberikan ulasan mendetail agar wisatawan lain memiliki informasi yang lebih baik daripada yang kami miliki sebelum memesan. Secara keseluruhan, kami sangat kecewa dengan masa inap kami. Hotel ini jauh dari hotel bintang 5. Paling banter, ini adalah hotel bintang 3, jadi sesuaikan ekspektasi Anda. Dulu, hotel ini mungkin sangat bagus, tetapi sekarang kepemilikannya baru dan jelas mereka tidak memprioritaskan tamu hotel. Di antara semua masalah yang kami hadapi, kebisingan adalah yang terburuk. Kebisingan - sayangnya, lingkungan tropis hotel dan akses ke pantai terus-menerus terganggu oleh kebisingan dan musik yang mengganggu. Pertama, resor ini memilih untuk memprioritaskan acara dan kegiatan daripada tamu yang menginap di resor. Selama 6 hari menginap, mereka secara teratur mengadakan acara besar dengan musik yang sangat keras, dengan DJ live dan band-band berkualitas rendah hingga pukul 21.00-23.00 setiap malam. Panggung didirikan tepat di luar bungalow tepi pantai resor, tempat kami menginap. Tidak ada perhatian sama sekali untuk anak kami yang berusia 3 tahun yang biasanya tidur pukul 19.30-20.00. Tidak di hotel ini… Anda bisa dengan jelas mendengar musik (apalagi bass-nya!) di kamar. Pada Minggu pagi, mereka mulai memainkan musik dansa bass-nya dengan keras pukul 06.30 tepat di luar kamar kami untuk semacam acara kelompok eksternal - itu membangunkan kami semua. Acara ini semakin keras dan berlangsung hingga pukul 10.00. Kedua, manajemen telah memutuskan untuk menebang pohon besar berusia 100 tahun, karena daunnya berguguran di kolam renang. Selama 6 hari kami di resor ini, mereka menghabiskan sepanjang hari dengan menggergaji dan menebang pohon ini. Suaranya sangat keras sehingga kami harus meninggalkan hotel setiap hari untuk mencari jeda dari kebisingan gergaji mesin. Staf yang kurang terlatih - sebagian besar staf sangat muda, tidak berpengalaman, dan tidak terlatih. Banyak yang ramah, tetapi banyak juga yang cukup kasar dan tampak sangat tidak senang. Makanan dan layanan yang buruk - kualitas sarapan prasmanan di bawah rata-rata. Pilihan makanannya lumayan, tetapi semuanya berkualitas buruk. Staf muda di stasiun telur selalu kewalahan dan seringkali tidak dapat memenuhi pesanan. Makanan tidak diisi ulang, piring-piring basah, dan sangat sedikit perhatian proaktif kepada pengunjung. Bagian terbaik dari sarapan adalah satu anggota staf senior yang bertugas, tetapi sayangnya dia dipecat. Makanan dan koktail di Restoran Basilico mengecewakan dan harganya juga sangat tinggi untuk kualitas rendah yang Anda dapatkan. Untungnya ada beberapa warung lokal berkualitas di dekatnya yang kami pilih untuk makan hampir setiap malam. Wifi tidak dapat diandalkan - di seluruh resor kami memiliki wifi yang tidak dapat diandalkan, seringkali tidak berfungsi sama sekali, yang membuat kehidupan sehari-hari menjadi sulit. Fasilitas bobrok dan tua - kamar-kamarnya sangat tua dan jelas menunjukkan usianya. Tak perlu dikatakan lagi, mereka tidak layak mendapatkan peringkat bintang 5. Kamar mandinya berfungsi, meskipun kecil dan sangat tua. Namun demikian, AC berfungsi dengan baik dan tempat tidurnya nyaman. Staf tata graha melakukan pekerjaan yang sangat baik setiap hari. Kamar mandi di tepi kolam renang tidak dapat diakses karena rusak menurut tanda, begitu pula banyak fasilitas lain di dekat area kolam renang yang rusak. Lampu bawah air di kolam renang juga rusak dengan kabel-kabel yang mengambang di air. Ada beberapa ayunan lucu di dekat tepi resor yang ingin digunakan anak kami yang berusia 3 tahun. Sayangnya, area di sekitarnya dipenuhi botol plastik, kantong plastik, dan sampah. Tempat ini tidak pernah dibersihkan. Satu-satunya toilet umum di ruang makan utama adalah satu-satunya yang tersedia untuk tamu di luar kamar dan sangat kotor, penuh dengan air toilet, dan terlebih lagi tidak ada sabun! Pantai - meskipun bukan kesalahan hotel, pantai ini merupakan tempat populer bagi penjual pernak-pernik lokal, jadi mustahil untuk menghabiskan waktu di pantai tanpa diganggu oleh banyak penjual. Musiknya juga sangat keras dan mengganggu setiap sore. Sisi positifnya, matahari terbenam setiap hari sangat indah dan ada tempat snorkeling yang lumayan tepat di lepas pantai."
"825.","AFM 123","42","2025-01-20","3","Jadi kami menginap di sini selama tiga malam di sebuah bungalow taman. Tempat tidurnya sangat nyaman, kamar mandinya perlu direnovasi; kamar kami hanya menyediakan air hangat kuku selama lima menit. Pelayanannya lumayan, tapi saya harus menunggu hingga 30 menit untuk mendapatkan cappuccino. Restoran ini jelas ditujukan untuk orang Asia, dan beberapa paket telah tersedia di sini. Daerah sekitarnya tidak terlalu istimewa. Restoran-restoran di tepi pantai, sekitar 1 km jauhnya, sangat bagus. Restoran-restoran itu mudah dijangkau saat air sedang surut. Makanan di hotel juga enak, tapi minumannya mahal."
"826.","Jean Philippe le Pair","6","2025-01-20","3","Kamar-kamar sudah ketinggalan zaman! Jelas bukan hotel bintang 5. Sarapannya biasa saja! Ada acara perusahaan di properti tersebut, yang membuat kami terbangun sangat pagi dari kegiatan dan berlangsung sepanjang hari—sama sekali tidak menenangkan! Kami baru diberitahu tentang hal ini pada sore hari sebelumnya! Kami pernah menginap di resor yang lebih baik dalam perjalanan ini."
"827.","Mike lyon schade","9","2025-01-20","3","Kamarnya bagus, tetapi kami mengalami beberapa masalah dengan kartu kunci kami dan harus membuat yang baru beberapa kali. Lokasinya bagus dan banyak hal yang bisa dilihat dan dikunjungi di kota setempat dengan beberapa restoran yang bagus! Pelayanannya buruk, kami menunggu makan siang dan minuman selama lebih dari 45 menit di hari pertama, dan pelayan baru datang sesekali. Mereka sama sekali tidak berbicara satu sama lain dan setengah dari mereka tidak tahu apa yang terjadi di hotel. Pelayanannya lambat dibandingkan dengan hotel-hotel lain di Lombok, Bali, dan Gili. Tidak ada pelayan yang fasih berbahasa Inggris."
"828.","Nike R","48","2025-01-20","3","Kamar dan kompleksnya sangat kuno, sungguh disayangkan. Semut merayap keluar dari sambungan di sekitar wastafel, dan semua yang ada di kamar mandi goyang dan lebih banyak rusak daripada berfungsi. Mekanisme pengunci pintu balkon di kamar saya rusak. Secara teori, ini berarti kamar dapat dengan mudah dibobol kapan saja. Handuk di kamar dan handuk pantai penuh dengan noda yang jelas tidak akan hilang jika dicuci. Area pantai terlalu kecil untuk sebuah resor pantai. Sarapan prasmanannya cukup lumayan."
"829.","Ruhul Amin","19","2022-01-20","3","Kami menghabiskan 8 malam selama Natal dan malam Tahun Baru untuk lebih dekat dengan alam. Lokasi resornya indah. Suasana luarnya luar biasa. Namun, kami memiliki pengalaman yang mengerikan dengan proses check-in dan check-out. Saat check-in, mereka memberi kami kupon minuman untuk dua orang, sementara kami bertiga; mereka mengatakan sarapan diperbolehkan untuk dua orang. Kemudian, mereka meminta maaf dan menawarkan sarapan untuk tiga orang. Stafnya ramah. Sarapannya rata-rata. Kamarnya sangat kecil dan toiletnya bahkan lebih kecil dibandingkan dengan hotel bintang 4 lainnya. Mereka menyediakan perlengkapan mandi yang terbatas. Dan proses check-out!!! Saya diminta membayar 800K IDR untuk malam gala ke-31, yang tidak makan. Ketika saya meminta untuk menunjukkan tagihan dengan tanda tangan saya, mereka tidak bisa. Kami memiliki penerbangan awal, saya harus pergi, tetapi mereka tidak meminta maaf untuk itu."
"830.","M. S.","31","2021-01-20","3","Sebagai bagian dari tur Bali kami, kami menginap di hotel ini selama tiga hari. Kompleksnya sungguh indah, hijau, dan sangat luas. Saat cuaca cerah, Anda bisa menikmati pemandangan matahari terbenam yang luar biasa! Pantainya sangat dekat dan relatif bersih. Sayangnya, kamar-kamarnya agak tua, tetapi Anda bisa menerimanya. Satu-satunya hal yang kurang menyenangkan adalah bau air pancuran. Penjual lokal juga menyebalkan. Mereka duduk tepat di dekat tangga menuju pantai dan mencoba menjual berbagai macam barang rongsokan yang tidak perlu. Mereka bahkan mengganggu Anda saat Anda sedang mengunyah makan malam di restoran hotel, yang sebagian terletak di pantai. Saya merasa itu sangat tidak sopan dan tidak akan pernah kembali ke sini hanya karena alasan ini!"
"831.","Jun Aidi","268","2025-01-20","3","Pantainya agak ramai karena letaknya di sebelah pantai umum, tempat banyak pedagang kaki lima atau penjual makanan lokal berjualan. Saya datang ke sini untuk makan di restoran, mereka seharusnya mengganti sampul menu restoran karena rusak dan beberapa halaman dalamnya basah karena air. Namun, stafnya ramah."
"832.","Heike Schallenberger","6","2024-01-20","3","Ini adalah kunjungan ketiga kami ke hotel ini, dan mungkin yang terakhir. Dengan pergantian kepemilikan, sayangnya keadaan menjadi jauh lebih buruk. Layanan yang baik tampaknya hanya tersedia untuk penduduk lokal akhir-akhir ini. Saya telah memberi tahu pihak hotel bahwa kami ingin dijemput di pelabuhan, dan mereka mengonfirmasinya, tetapi tidak ada seorang pun di sana. Kami berempat, dua di antaranya berusia di atas 70 tahun, dan dengan empat koper besar dan tas tangan, perjalanan dari pelabuhan ke hotel terasa seperti bencana. Pada beberapa hari, hotel ini begitu penuh dengan mobil yang diparkir sehingga tidak ada taksi yang bisa masuk, dan kami terpaksa menggunakan layanan antar-jemput hotel, yang biayanya dua kali lipat. Kami juga memesan taksi dari resepsionis dua kali, dan ketika taksi tiba, seseorang dari hotel datang dari belakang dan memasukkan orang lain ke dalam taksi kami. Perlu diingat, kami adalah satu-satunya orang di resepsionis ketika kami memesan taksi, jadi itu pasti taksi kami! Kami mendapatkan bungalow dengan pemandangan laut, sungguh impian! Namun sayangnya, pada beberapa malam, musik di pantai terdengar terlalu keras. Kami selalu memesan hotel ini karena kedamaian dan ketenangannya yang luar biasa! Seperti yang sudah saya katakan, sayangnya, banyak hal telah menurun. Namun, layanan dari petugas kebersihan dan di kedua restoran tetap sangat baik seperti biasa, dan kami sangat senang June masih bekerja di hotel."
"833.","Rita Brito Ferreira","16","2025-08-20","3","Kamar-kamar sangat tua, perlu direnovasi. Lokasi spektakuler."
"834.","Eva H","47","2018-01-20","3","Resornya sendiri memiliki lanskap yang indah. Namun, bungalow pantai kami sebenarnya tidak berada di pantai, melainkan dipisahkan dari tanggul oleh pagar. Selain itu, bungalownya agak kuno. Kamar mandinya fungsional, tetapi tidak terlalu menarik, meskipun tempat tidurnya bagus dan nyaman. Pilihan sarapannya cukup baik untuk standar Indonesia, dan makanannya juga cukup lezat. Area berenang khusus di pantai sangat cocok untuk berenang, dengan kursi berjemur yang diletakkan agak ke belakang di taman. Lokasi hotel sangat strategis; semua tempat penting di Senggigi dapat dicapai dengan berjalan kaki."
"835.","Dewi Kuenzli","279","2025-01-20","3","Kami sudah lama tahu hotel ini dengan taman tepi lautnya yang menakjubkan, tetapi stafnya tidak profesional seperti hotel bintang 5 dan makanannya tidak seenak taman bintang 5. Meski sudah direnovasi, hotel ini tetap saja tua."
"836.","Khrisna Muzad Gangsar","11","2018-01-20","3","Sarapan prasmanannya lumayan, tetapi stafnya tidak responsif untuk mengisi ulang makanan (hanya ketika kami tidak diberi tahu) dan mereka tidak cepat mengambil piring bekas dari meja. Air panas tidak mengalir secara konsisten. Stafnya sangat membantu. Secara keseluruhan, layanannya bagus, tetapi perlu ditingkatkan agar lebih sempurna."
"837.","Matthew McCarthy","6","2019-01-20","3","Menginap selama 4 malam. Ringkasan. Lumayan bagus, akomodasinya lumayan, tetapi kamarnya kecil dan kamar mandinya sangat kecil dan sangat mendasar, sehingga mengecewakan. AC rusak 2 kali dalam 4 hari, tetapi sudah diperbaiki dengan cepat. Secara keseluruhan, pengalaman bintang 3, lumayan, tetapi lumayan."
"838.","Michel Overman","50","2019-01-20","3","Sayangnya tempat ini tidak sepadan dengan 5 bintang yang diklaimnya. Kamar-kamarnya jelas usang, begitu pula kamar mandinya. Satu-satunya yang dilakukan petugas kebersihan adalah merapikan tempat tidur Anda, alih-alih membersihkan kamar secara normal. Bahkan jika ada noda tak dikenal dari tamu sebelumnya di seprai Anda, petugas kebersihan akan mengabaikannya begitu saja. Sayang sekali mengingat resor ini terletak di pantai yang indah!"
"839.","Marc Taquet","55","2017-01-20","3","Ulasan yang sangat beragam, yang membenarkan penilaian tersebut. Untuk lokasi, taman, kolam renang, pantai, sarapan yang luar biasa dan sangat lengkap, tidak ada yang perlu dikeluhkan. Hotel ini layak diberi 4 hingga 5 bintang. Masalahnya berasal dari kebisingan dari luar. Saya menghabiskan dua malam yang mengerikan bahkan dengan penyumbat telinga, karena kamar kami, 349, yang terletak di ujung taman hotel, sangat dekat dengan jalan dengan disko dan bar karaoke-nya. Kamar-kamarnya sangat buruk kedap suara; Anda bahkan dapat mendengar tetangga Anda. Di kedua malam itu, musik tekno memenuhi kepala saya hingga pukul 4 pagi, dan pada pukul 5 pagi muazin berkumandang. Singkatnya, hotel ini layak diberi nilai 2. Luar biasa untuk hotel sekelas ini."
"840.","Ivana","58","2022-01-20","3","Tempatnya bagus, sarapannya biasa saja, saya pesan bungalow dengan pemandangan laut. Di kamar pertama, banyak semut di dalamnya, bahkan di kamar saya sendiri. Jadi saya minta pindah ke kamar baru. Kamar barunya bagus, meskipun tempatnya tua, tetap oke. Lalu, pas bangun pagi, saya digigit serangga aneh. Entah apa itu, tapi banyak sekali dan sepertinya itu tungau kasur. Tapi secara keseluruhan, oke. Keramahannya 2,5/5."
"841.","Jelte Homminga","95","2017-01-20","3","Sopir taksi menyarankan pantai ini dan membawa kami ke sini. Pantai ini berada di area Kila Resort. Pantainya lumayan, tapi kecil. Pilihan restoran atau barnya juga tidak banyak. Kami hanya bisa memilih dari hotel. Saya rasa lebih baik pergi ke Pantai Senggigi yang utama."
"842.","Junia Anindya","363","2023-01-20","3","Saya kurang puas selama menginap di sini dan menurut saya harganya tidak sepadan. Waktu check-in sangat lama. Restorannya penuh sesak, bahkan jam 8 pagi pun mereka sudah kehabisan makanan. Saya mencoba restoran mereka di sore hari dan makanannya sangat buruk dan mahal. Lokasinya memang dekat dengan pantai."
"843.","Raphael Kolbeck","19","2019-01-20","3","Lokasinya sempurna, pantainya indah, makanan dan minumannya agak mahal untuk kualitasnya, dan kami tidak tahu kenapa stafnya selalu agak kasar. Anda harus menguji sendiri nilai resor ini untuk uang; menurut kami harganya agak terlalu mahal."
"844.","Lorenzo Lodolo D'Oria","3","2023-01-20","3","Tempat yang besar dan indah, sayang sekali tentang pelayanan di restoran: mereka tidak mengerti hidangan yang mereka tulis di menu dan untuk salad mereka membuat Anda menunggu selama satu jam"
