"4.","Nellie H","129","2023-12-31","4","The food was really good. Was a bit concerned when reading the comments but the food was fantastic. A little more expensive, but it is hotel prices. Took the tuna and calamaris for starter and seafood plate for main course. The taste was really really good. Very impressive"
"5.","Sony Ganadhi","781","2022-12-31","4","Terletak didalam kompleks hotel Wyndham..sangat nyaman, pelayanan ramah, penataan bagus dan bersih.. Saat sore, bisa menikmati suara ombak sambil menikmati minuman beer. Sayangnya, selama kami menginap disana, pelayanan sangat lama. Mungkin krn kurang pelayannya. Maklum, selama libur lebaran, banyak room terbook."

"31.","Ragni Sirilan","9","2025-03-03","4","We stayed here for the first time. The staff who were on when we arrived were more than welcoming. Big beautiful smiles and very helpful with us checking in. Our room wasn't ready witch was very fine with us as it gave us more opportunity to see more of this lovely Bali with our private driver. When we did get back our rooms were ready and Wayan who took us to our room was very helpful, talked the resort. Because we came from Adelaide, Wayan mentioned he had been to Adelaide, while working on a cruise, witch connected us stright away.Aw we checked our rooms we found some problems with the mini fridge as our children did too. We brought this up the the front desk, and also our plunge pool, witch was quite dirty. Risa and the general man working with her were very sympathetic about the situation and said they will get onto the following morning. We enjoyed the day out and got back to a very clean plunge pool and working mini fridges. The cleaners also did a great job on our rooms. The only negative thing about this place is the food at the restaurant, we ate in for dinner, the food was very dry and way too over cooked, the squid was very tastless and rock hard, witch the waiter said its ment to be like that. He was kind enough to take it off our bill. My husband got the duck witch was OK, but not as bad as our daughters chicken, now that was beyond dry,our son got a rice dish witch came with some meat, I have to admit one of the chicken on the plate was so over cooked, We first didn't know what kind of meat it was. I got the beef pizza that was very average. This experience did put us off from coming back to try out any other dishes. Over all the staff were very helpful and always greeted us with a smile. Definitely will come back but not for the food. Thank you all for making us welcome and making our stay lovely."

"40.","Alison De Maria","85","2024-12-31","1","Most things on the drinks menu are not available. Wine was opened 2 weeks ago and was foul and oxidized. The staff didnt give a shit. The food was questionable in terms of quality, and preparation. Cold on arrival to the table, or undercooked and cold in the middle of the duck (which took a long time to arrive dispite obviously having bee precooked and reheated). Across 9 people one dish was ok, 3 dishes passable the rest discusting. We also noticed afterwards the menu price did not match the bill. DO NOT RECOMMEND."

We had burgers and the bacon on the burgers smelled weird and didn’t even look like bacon. Structure and taste of the burger was also weird."

"51.","Najeeb Olomi","2","2023-12-31","1","My stay at the Wyndham Jivva Resort was highly disappointing on multiple fronts. The service provided by the staff was abysmal. They appeared disinterested and indifferent towards guests, making interactions impersonal and unsatisfying. It was almost impossible to get any assistance or attention, leaving me feeling neglected and frustrated throughout my stay. The pool at the resort was a major letdown. It was poorly maintained and unclean, undermining any desire to take a refreshing swim. The water seemed murky and uninviting, suggesting a lack of regular maintenance and care. The pool definitely did not match the standard one would expect from a reputed resort, leaving me feeling cheated and displeased. The food served at the resort was another major disappointment. The quality was mediocre at best, and the options were limited and repetitive. The lack of flavor and creativity in the meals was evident, leaving me unsatisfied and unimpressed with the resort's dining options. It felt like a missed opportunity to provide a delightful culinary experience for the guests. The management at Wyndham Jivva Resort failed to meet expectations. They displayed a lack of organization and responsiveness to guests' concerns. It seemed that they were more interested in cutting corners than ensuring a pleasant stay for their patrons. Any attempts to address my concerns with the management were futile, leaving me feeling dissatisfied and ignored. Lastly, the staff's attitude was consistently unpleasant. They lacked professionalism and courtesy, which made interactions uncomfortable and unwelcoming. Their lack of dedication and enthusiasm created a negative ambiance, significantly impacting the overall experience. The staff's indifference towards guests was disappointing and far from what one would expect from a resort of this caliber. In conclusion, the Wyndham Jivva Resort fell far short of expectations. The inadequate service, poorly maintained pool, uninspiring food, ineffective management, and unwelcoming staff all contributed to a highly unsatisfactory stay. I strongly discourage anyone from choosing this resort if they desire a pleasant and enjoyable vacation. It was a regrettable waste of time and money."

"53.","rene springall","151","2022-12-31","2","Although it's a nice little beach club at Klungkung area, the staff were friendly and tried their best to gave best service, however the food were awful. We ordered steak and pizza, it turned out were not as we requested and one of them was not cook properly (frozen). Despite they were apologized about it, however the foods has been served."

"55.","Ela Ratschiller","31","2018-12-31","4","Great weatern food, it tastes like at home and i am from italy! The pool is the best! Its huge and surrounded by white sand. The place is always clean and directly beside the beach. Staff are nice! We keep on going back there. Its very relaxing. We got small children and its suitable for them as well. The huge outdoor cinema screen is fun too, but they only use it in the evenings, which makes sense. Prices are okay for what you get because they cook with real salmon, seafood, cheese.... Only the local food is a bit overpriced."

"60.","Pawl Pawl","10","2022-12-31","1","Nice place, relaxing .. However they need a bartender who knows how to make drinks and a chef who can cook.. Mai tai cocktail was just a glass of guava juice and the food had no love or flavour.. Didn’t finish it and just went to get some street food which was $2 and delicious. Coffee was good, that’s all."
"61.","sukses oke","13","2021-12-31","1","Kecewa dengan pengalaman terakhir kesini tgl 12 oktober 2021. Saya tidak ambil paket renang namun hanya makan dan pesan 1 kentang goreng, 1 cocacola & 1 teh jahe. Namun yg datang adalah 1 kentang goreng, 2 coca cola, & 2 teh jahe. Saya sudah complain bahwa saya hanya pesan 1 cola dan petugas menarik kembali 1 botol cola. Dan saat pembayaran yg tertulis di nota adalah 1 kentang goreng, 2 cocacola, & 3 teh jahe ++. Sangat mengecewakan pelayanannya padahal sudah sangat sering pergi kesana & saya niatkan untuk support para pekerja yg terdampak pandemi & selalu saya posting dengan kesan yg bagus di IG agar orang2 tertarik datang ke JBC."

The color its more like green and you can’t see the ceramic of the pool because its to dirty second, the tasted of the pizza i can give you 4 star, but their Nasi Goreng taste its disappointed, for me 80k its to expensive for kind of taste nasi goreng in the beach club"

"80.","Taco de Vries","1097","2018-12-31","3","Jivva beach club is the lonely resort at the beach of Klungkung. This is a black sand beach and can be rather dangerous to swim in because of a strong undercurrent. In the weekend a lot of locals visit the beach who probably can never afford a drink or meal at Jivva Beach Club. The beach club is fenced. The food is reasonable but pricey. Service is good."

"181.","Елена Майер","7","2025-07-01","1","Tempat yang mengerikan. Kalau kamu lihat ulasanku, jangan ke sana. Kamu bakal kelaparan. Mustahil makan, dan stafnya sama sekali tidak mau membantu masalah makanan. Mereka malah menyuruhmu bayar dan pulang. Mengerikan."
"182.","D G","151","2022-12-31","3","Stafnya sangat ramah, dan makanannya memang sangat enak. Namun, banyak menu yang ingin saya pesan sayangnya tidak tersedia, baik makanan maupun minuman biasa. Jadi saya memesan burger daging sapi, yang rasanya sangat enak tetapi agak mahal. Secara umum, harganya memang agak lebih mahal."
"183.","Andrey Telebin","209","2023-12-31","2","Awalnya, tempat ini tampak sangat berwarna dan keren, tetapi setelah satu jam, nuansanya mulai terasa: Anda tidak bisa masuk ke laut, kolam renangnya sedalam pinggang dan kotor, dan restorannya mahal dan hambar. Ada yang perlu diperbaiki!"
"184.","Alma de Testa","104","2025-05-31","4","Restorannya bagus, stafnya sangat ramah. Tempatnya indah dan dekorasinya bagus. Harganya memang agak mahal, tapi sepadan kalau kamu ingin dekat dengan pantai 😇 …"
"185.","Оля Константинова","2","2024-12-31","1","Kami menemukan tempat ini secara kebetulan. Kami melihat peringkat Google 4,4 dan langsung pergi makan siang tanpa ragu. Harganya jauh lebih mahal daripada rata-rata. Di tempat yang asing, kami memesan hidangan paling sederhana - salad Caesar dan semangkuk nasi dengan daging sapi. Saya belum pernah melihat penyajian yang lebih buruk dari kedua hidangan ini seumur hidup saya. Salad Caesar (Rp100 ribu) terdiri dari daun selada iceberg + dua potong ayam + saus mayones encer + sosis yang tidak bisa dipahami (yang saya takut makan) + dua potong kecil roti. Mangkuk nasi dengan daging sapi (Rp98 ribu) - nasi kering + daging sapi dingin + brokoli. Saya tidak merekomendasikan tempat ini kepada siapa pun."

"187.","gee hoon ann","45","2023-12-31","5","Burgernya lezat. Untuk kopi, pesan espresso dan es."
"188.","Егор Труфанов","4","2021-12-31","1","Rasio harga/kualitasnya benar-benar di bawah rata-rata. Stafnya hampir tidak bisa berbahasa Inggris. Makanannya sangat sederhana. Kolam renangnya rusak. Setengah dari menunya hilang. Kami berkendara dari Ubud - sangat kecewa. Namun, jika Anda tinggal di dekat sini, misalnya di hotel terdekat - Anda bisa pergi dan makan siang dengan makanan yang sangat biasa saja. Bagaimanapun, saya akan memilih sesuatu yang lebih menarik."
"189.","Hoa Tươi Tường An","53","2022-12-31","5","Saya ikut tur, jadi saya tidak tahu apakah harganya lebih murah daripada tempat lain!? Tapi prasmanannya cuma ada air putih, kalau mau minum air kelapa atau kokain, saya harus bayar terpisah."
"190.","Mariska Buijs","9","2023-12-31","1","Pizza-nya kering dan lebih mirip pizza beku, ayamnya enak tapi kentang gorengnya dingin, musiknya tidak sesuai suasana, dan harganya dua kali lipat dari harga normal di Bali."
"191.","Alex Koeberlein","13","2023-12-31","1","Makanannya terlalu mahal dan tidak terlalu enak. Pelayanannya kurang memuaskan. Anda bisa mendapatkan makanan yang lebih enak di restoran lokal dengan harga sepersepuluhnya. Sangat tidak direkomendasikan."
"192.","Gabor Mergel","9","2019-12-31","5","Hari terakhir perjalanan kami di Bali. Tempat yang indah dan tenang dengan staf yang sangat ramah. Harganya terjangkau. Surga. :-) 3 anak, Ibu dan Ayah. Terima kasih 🙏 …"
"193.","сергей шубин","24","2018-12-31","5","Tempat yang luar biasa dan nyaman. Ada kolam renang dengan pantai berpasir, hotel bintang lima, dan pelayanannya memuaskan. Saya merekomendasikannya."
"194.","Jakub Ch","61","2019-12-31","2","Stafnya lebih banyak berjalan daripada melayani (shift bodoh?) dan koktailnya kurang enak. Kalau pencahayaannya pas, cocok untuk foto Instagram ✔️"
