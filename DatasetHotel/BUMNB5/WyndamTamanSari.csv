"1.","Punto Dewa","193","2025-12-01","5","Wyndham Tamansari Jivva Resort Bali is a beautiful beachfront property that exceeded my expectations. The beach is clean, calm, and perfect for relaxing, and the sunset views are absolutely incredible. The resort itself is big, spacious, and very peaceful, making it an ideal place for a quiet and romantic escape. I loved how well-maintained everything was, from the rooms to the garden areas. The atmosphere feels private and relaxing, far from the crowded tourist spots. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful throughout our stay, always ready with a smile and quick assistance. If you’re looking for a serene beachfront getaway in Bali with great service, beautiful scenery, and a calm environment, this resort is a perfect choice. I would definitely come back."

Staff were generous and breakfast was available with many options. The hotel hosts many events and gladly they still assist food n drinks services over the beach club when the restaurant is way up near the lobby. This hotel has gym, spa and all the 5-star resort provides. Excellent hospitality. Many thanks Ibu Fransiska Ibu Widya and the entire Jivva members ❤️"
"3.","Imam Fahmi","193","2025-12-01","5","Pertama kali nginep di hotel bintang 5 selama 2 malam. Pelayanan sangat bagus, mulai dari resepsionis sampe staffnya ramah semua dan sangat helpful. Bahkan setelah check in nnti bakal dibantu dan diantar staff menuju kamar. Kebetulan dapat kamar dibawah jd gak perlu naik tangga/lift, dan view belakang kamar lgsg ke kolam renang. Disini setiap belakang kamar ada balkonnya, mungkin ada jg kamar yg menghadap ke laut (hotel ini lokasinya di pinggir pantai pas). Ukuran kamarnya sangat besar dan luas, amenities lengkap, ada sandal, hairdryer, alat mandi lengkap, handuk besar 2, kecil 2, trs baju mandi jg ada (yg model seperti handuk, sy gak tau namanya 🗿) ada teh, kopi, gula, krimer, dpt air botol 2, ada kulkas kecil juga, tp kebetulan di kamar sy tidak berfungsi, saluran tv sangat beragam, ac sangat dingin, ada sofa juga di dalam kamar, lalu di bagian balkon jg ada kursi dan meja, cocok kalau buat ngopi santai dengan view kolam renang. Kamar mandi ada bathtub nya, shower, wastafel. Air dingin dan panas berfungsi dengan baik. Sarapan nya beragam dan rasanya enak semua, tidak ada yg mengecewakan. Pelayan jg sangat ramah, saat sy ingin titip barang di kulkas hotel, pelayan lgsg menjemput ke kamar, dan ketika ingin diambil bisa langsung diantar ke kamar juga. Hotel ini lokasinya agak jauh dari kota jd cocok untuk yg mau mencari ketenangan dan kedamaian. Mungkin jika ada kesempatan, sy akan kembali ke hotel ini, terimakasih Wyndham Tamansari Jivva Resort 👌"

The staff are amazing and super friendly and helpful. The villa is serene, the location is far away from anything which is perfect if you are looking for a relaxing stay. The prices for meals are the same as Australian prices and the menu isn’t the best, but I highly recommend this venue."
"5.","Jane","39","2025-12-01","5","⭐ A Truly Exceptional 70 Night Stay at Wyndham Tamansari Jivva. After spending 70 unforgettable nights at the Wyndham Tamansari Jivva Resort in Bali, My husband & I can honestly say this resort has become a second home to us. Every moment here has been shaped by the warmth, kindness, and dedication of the staff, who turned a long stay into an experience filled with joy, comfort, and genuine connection. A heartfelt thank you to Ariani and Awik in the restaurant, whose smiles and gracious service brightened every single day. Their attention to detail and ability to make each meal feel personal, truly made dining a pleasure. Our deep appreciation also goes to Chefs Gusti and Gede, whose passion in the kitchen is nothing short of remarkable. Every plate they crafted was a reflection of skill, heart, and Bali’s rich flavours. They, & their team made each meal something to look forward to. A big thank-you also to Adi, Yogi, and the entire room attendants team, who kept everything immaculate and comfortable throughout our long stay. Their hard work, friendliness, and thoughtful touches did not go unnoticed and meant more than they know. A special mention also to the wonderful Juniari from the TIRTA Spa, her variety of Balinese traditional massages, body treatments & facials, were a truly sensational experience. And of course, to all the wonderful staff across the resort, each of you contributed to an experience that was memorable in the best possible way. From warm greetings in the mornings to helpful conversations in the evenings, your kindness has left a lasting mark. This resort isn’t just a beautiful place to stay; it’s a place filled with people who genuinely care. We leave with gratitude, cherished memories, and a promise to return in 2026. Terima kasih, Wyndham Jivva. You all made our time in Bali truly special. 🌴✨"
"6.","Yuli Rahmayanti","13","2025-10-01","3","I stayed here about a month ago, and honestly the hotel really needs better maintenance as there are many rusty areas. The room itself was clean, but I didn’t like the smell of the linen—it felt a bit damp. The shower room was too small (I even saw a centipede on the shower wall), and the room wasn’t soundproof, so it was quite disturbing at night when I could hear guests next door arguing. On the positive side, the food was okay, the price was fair, and the service from the staff was excellent. It’s a pity, because the location, the view, and the staff are already great. With proper maintenance, this place could be amazing."
"7.","Gaga Santosa","282","2025-12-01","4","Located on the coastal area of Klungkung, Bali, this resort can be a good choice for staying and exploring the surrounding Klungkung area. The sound of the crashing waves is clear and calming; however, the vibration from the waves can be felt in the room and sometimes feels like an earthquake, which startled me at times. According to the hotel booking app, this property is categorized as a 5-star hotel. Personally, I would rate it 4 stars, considering the many maintenance issues that affect comfort. The building and garden areas, including the small lake near Jivva Beach Club, are not well maintained. The rooftops of several buildings are an eyesore, the metal pillars are rusty, and some rooms appear empty or damaged with doors left open. For these reasons, I would give a 3- or 4-star rating for the facilities. However, the service truly deserves a full 5 stars — the staff are well-trained, friendly, and professional. The main issue lies in the hotel’s building maintenance. I booked two rooms located in Unit 5 on the 2nd and 3rd floors. The room on the upper floor feels the vibrations from the waves even more strongly, almost like an earthquake. I’m not sure whether this was studied during the construction phase regarding its long-term impact, though I’m sure the project was planned carefully. One of my rooms had a balcony with a jacuzzi, and the other had a private pool on the terrace. The view featured a lush yard and coconut trees, which was quite relaxing. As for breakfast, I’d say it was just standard for a 4-star hotel. During my 3-night stay, the breakfast menu changed daily, but it still felt monotonous and lacked variety. I’m not sure whether the hotel’s official rating is 4 or 5 stars. Hopefully, in the future, the hotel will repair the damaged roofs, rusty pillars, lights around the lake, and the garden near the lake, so guests can feel more comfortable walking through that area on the way to JBC."
"8.","Krista Jensen","24","2025-10-01","1","NO WAY, NO STAY. this hotel should be condemned and closed. it is not a five star hotel. the number of extensive outstanding repairs that could result in serious injury are mind blowing. as an architect it is obvious that only time, lack of funding, and negligence allows a property to degrade to such an unsafe degree. there is a sign at the desk that says projects are a result of recent storms, but unfortunately that cannot be true…. all metal railings are corroded so badly they are no longer even in tact, even from upper 2 and 3rd floors. an issue of this magnitude takes time, not a one time storm…. all wood decking throughout is rotted out entirely and sagging. you literally fall through holes as you walk. rusted metal and nails everywhere. not to mention the massive overheard ceiling holes throughout the entire property. guests should be given a hard hat. we were so put off by the lack of safety throughout the buildings that we didn’t dare enter the pool. i would never bring small children here. windows in upper floor rooms open at least 1m wide without any safety latches. kids could lean right out and fall. this is all a lawsuit waiting to happen. we unfortunately packed our bags after only a few hours and departed. i feel for the kind and helpful staff that work here and wish them all the best. they are obviously the gift that keeps this place open….😔"

"10.","Salma Al Hasan","230","2025-12-01","1","It's far to go anywhere, there's hair on the bed in the room, breakfast isn't varied, the waiter plays with his phone while serving, the staff isn't friendly at all. The building is spacious. The view is good."

"13.","Era puspita Yanthy","33","2025-08-31","5","The view was really nice and the staff were friendly. The bellman was super helpful with my luggage. I forgot to ask his name but I think he might be a trainee, and he did a great job. Check-in was a bit delayed since the room wasn’t ready yet, but it wasn’t a big deal. Overall, it was still a pleasant stay and I’d consider coming back🙂"

"15.","bona atoes","1","2025-08-31","1","book hotel ini lewat traveloka. check in yang seharusnya udah bisa dari jam 14.00 malah baru bisa check in jam 3.30. itu pun setelah saya hubungi dan akan saya batalkan jika saya masih harus menunggu kamar ready. alasan mereka kamar BELUM SIAP dan kami BOOKING TAMBAHAN. seolah itu salah kami sebagai customer. kalau kamar belum ready ya jangan dibuka di aplikasi dong. trus malah nyalahin customer padahal kami ngga dapat kamar yang kami mau (kami minta kamar di high floor, tapi dikasih kamar di lantai 1). Resepsionis di FO juga sangat lambat melayani tamu dan menyalahkan sistem mereka. setelah menunggu 1,5 jam, kami berhasil check in tapi menemukan masalah baru lagi yaitu KULKAS RUSAK/MATI. saya menelepon operator dan baru dilakukan penggantian 2 jam setelah saya memberitahu mereka. menu sarapan di hotel juga sedikit dan B saja. tidak seperti hotel lain yang lebih banyak dan bervariasi. jacuzzi/bathtub di balkon kamar juga rusak dan tidak bisa digunakan. SUNGGUH SANGAT MERUGIKAN DAN MEMBUANG WAKTU SERTA UANG ANDA untuk menginap di hotel ini. sebaiknya Anda tidak membuang waktu anda memilih hotel ini untuk menginap dan berlibur di hotel ini."
"16.","Maggie Irawan Tan","86","2025-07-01","4","Lokasi agak jauh dari Kuta, Canggu dll. Tidak terlalu jauh dari Bali Safari, beach club terkenal seperti Breman, Komune & Flamingo. Ada juga winery2 seperti Two island, Sababay, Hatten yg bisa kita kunjungi sambil coba wine tasting. + Sudah beberapa kali stay disini, kamarnya bersih, ga lembab, cukup terawat. Saya suka konsep hotelnya, outdoor banget. Breakfastnya juga lumayan, egg Florentine & benedictnya proper, kematangannya pas. - Banyak bagian bagunan yg harus direnov, krn sdh menunjukkan tanda2 menua. Di beberapa tempat detail seperti pintu, lantai koridor dll juga sdh mulai ada yg tear off, boncel, mengelupas dll. 2 kolam renangnya juga perlu diimprove sih. Kolam utama yg dekat pantai sering ditutup kalau ombak sedang tinggi. Apparently perlu dipercantik lagi keramik2nya dll. Di kolam renang kecilnya juga ada beberapa keramik yg pecah, dan airnya tidak terlalu bersih. Restonya juga perlu bgt diperbaiki, kmrn pas hujan bocor dimana2. Kalau tampias & angin sih ya nasib ya.. Tapi ternyata banyak bagian atapnya yang bocor jadi meja & lantainya basah kuyub. Yg paling perlu diperhatikan: hotel ini kan konsepnya outdoor, dari lobby ke parkiran, atau ke kamar atau ke resto, kemana2 mesti lewat luar. Perlu banget disiapkan banyak payung ya.. Kemarin pas hujan, di kamar tdk tersedia payung, di koridor jg tidak ada payung. Saya dan anak terpaksa hujan2an utk ke resto. Di resto tersedia payung, itu pun hrs rebutan dgn guest lain krn payung sedikit dan banyak yg rusak."
"17.","Melly Mo","24","2025-08-31","1","Disappointed and wasted of time! We booked a Suite Ocean View for a weekend staycation, hoping to relax and slow down for a couple of days. The check-in time stated was 2 PM, but we arrived at 4 PM after exploring the area, expecting to head straight to our room and enjoy the sunset. From the start, the experience was already frustrating. The front desk couldn’t find my reservation and openly discussed with another staff member that my booking had been “accidentally cancelled by their system.” I never received any notification from the resort or the third-party booking platform. After around 15 minutes, they told us the room wasn’t ready and sent us to wait at the restaurant. There was no compensation or gesture of goodwill offered for their mistake just a “sorry” until we ask for late check out to cover it and continue to another hour of waiting. We checked with the restaurant staff about our room since sunset was approaching. They called the front desk, who said it would be “another 10 minutes.” 15 minutes later, still no update. Frustrated, we went back to the front desk, ready to cancel and request a refund. Suddenly, they said the room was ready and offered free late check-out and breakfast, but at that point, the damage was done. Since we booked it through the third party and no cancellation so the process is even more complicated! And its already almost 6pm! Bye sunset! To make matters worse, they claimed they had been looking for us at the restaurant 10 minutes earlier but couldn’t find us which didn’t make sense since we had just spoken to the restaurant staff 15 minutes prior and didn’t go anywhere just wait. Clearly, there was no communication between the front desk and the restaurant. 🚩 They also said our belongings were already in the room, but when we insisted on cancelling, they brought them back to us in just a few minutes highly unlikely given how large the property is. This made me feel they had simply left our luggage in the lobby the whole time. 🚩 Because of the delay and poor handling, we had to make a last-minute booking at another accommodation just to salvage the rest of our trip. Overall, it was a complete waste of time and an utter disappointment. Poor communication, false information, and a lack of accountability ruined our expectations from the very beginning. Definitely not the relaxing getaway we had planned."

"23.","Remco Koster","22","2025-10-01","3","This hotel is a mixed bag. The rooms are nice and spacious, the a la carte food from the menu is very good. However, the buffet breakfast is a big let down; don’t book or order it in the restaurant. It is way overpriced (180,000 rupiah ++): the selection is very poor (only two Indonesian dishes), hygiene not good: they let someone who is clearly sick, coughing, sniffing work at the egg station and for coffee the buffet breakfast coffee tasted like water and if you want a cappuccino you have to pay! (After complaining heavily they gave it to me FOC). For juice they had juice rotating (only one choice) and for example one day only pineapple juice. I asked for orange juice and guess what: I had to pay… total rip off. Later they told me I could have had chilled orange juice for free, but this was not offered to me as an option; they offered to look at it for me (why I got charged but never did and no action was taken)"

"25.","Shana Khan","27","2025-07-01","5","Absolutely loved every second of this hotel! From the moment we walked in it was heaven on earth! One of the most dreamiest hotels ever, so pretty & clean! We upgraded our room to the beach front which was very cheap to do so, and it had its own private jacuzzi, loved every moment of it! We went here for my husbands 40th & they decorated the room too (at an extra cost) but well worth it! Only downside was (lots of flies in the restaurant, and I’d say the hotel rooms could do with a bit of refurbishment although the rooms were gorgeous as they were, the equipment was a little dated. Me and my husband loved the room service best, we’d always get our evening meal delivered to the bedroom, which was fantastic, not to forget the food was delicious! Services 10/10, people 10/10, picturesque 10/10!!! I’d still give it a 5star rating for how amazing it was overall!"
"26.","Patanjali Babu Vaseekaran","23","2025-07-31","5","Our stay at Tamasari Jivva Beach Resort in Bali was truly exceptional. From the moment we arrived—late at night after a long journey—the staff had everything perfectly arranged for us. The reception was smooth, our room was clean and comfortable, and the overall service was outstanding. This five-star resort is beautiful and well-maintained, offering a peaceful, relaxing environment throughout our stay. One of the highlights of our trip was visiting the Gate of Heaven, and returning to such a well-run and welcoming place each day made the experience even more special. In Bali, I would recommend to stay near the places you want to visit, enjoying the travel and seeing the places."

Room was mouldy n lift not working without any information from the hotel. Main pool was closed without any information from the hotel. Need to improve cleanliness especially room n restaurant. One thing that good in this hotel was the attitude of staff n training."

"32.","Findhy Silavatto","6","2025-05-31","5","Perdana menginap disini saat liburan Natal & 1 kata yaitu nyaman. Hotel bintang 5 dengan harga yg sangat affordable. Cuma 15 mnt ke Bali Safari. Sy bersama kluarga menginap di kmr suite yg menghadap laut. Nice, warm, calm..bikin mager kluar kamar. Cocok banget buat yg cari ketenangan, sambil duduk di balkon lihat laut & langit, dengerin deburan ombak, nice bngt pokoknya. Lokasinya pun tidak masuk terlalu ke dalam, dekat jalan raya besar. Menu sarapan juga sangat variatif. Jika ombak sedang tinggi tetep masih bisa berenang di kolam yg area tengah. Areanya bagus jg utk foto prewed. Meskipun saat awal sy masuk kamar ada sdikit kendala, tapi pihak hotel bgitu gercep skali menangani kendala yg sy alami meski sedang full occupancy saat itu. Kamar jg bersih & luas. Terimakasih banyak kepada Bpk Ngurah Ekamulya, manajer on duty saat itu beserta para staf yg bertugas, begitu ramah2 & gercep saat mengatasi kendala di kamar sy, sehingga membuat liburan sy & kluarga smakin berkesan. Nyesel bngt cuma 1 malam saat itu krn harus lanjut lagi esok harinya ke wilayah Bali lainnya. One day we will come back here again. Saran aja, klo menurut sy akan lbh perfect lg klo jacuzzi di depan kamar ada air hangatnya hehe 😊🙏"
"33.","Carol Manukau","125","2025-07-31","4","Non swim beachfront, but salt water pools available. The restaurant and bar close earlier than you'd think for a tourist resort. The rooms were luxurious, but the quality of finish not fantastic. Rooms cleaned daily. There was no indoor areas available outside of your rooms. The restaurant is open air which is challenging when stormy/raining. The building was falling down in bits, which does make a erson worry when the building shakes while you're in bed in the strong winds when you're on the top floor. Friendly enough service provided and gorgeous views. Noone was at the gym when I was there and the yoga bale was very popular early each morning."
"34.","Rizki Ratna Sari","11","2025-05-31","1","Nginep disini 3-6 mei 2025 (3 malam). 1. Cek in malam sekitar jam 20.00, Malam pertama lgsg kedatangan tamu tak diundang dan bawa saudara2 nya. Yg ke video cuma 1. Sekelas hotel bintang 5 kok ya pelihara anak kecoa wkwkwk. Telpon room service nunggu sekitar 10mnt datang buat nyariin anak kecoa lainnya. Lgsg dicek seluruh kamar. Besok pagi nya house keeping minta maaf dan akan mencari dan bersihkan menyeluruh kamar (semprot2 atau apalah itu) agar kecoa gak muncul lg. Total ada 5 anak kecoa (mungkin nyariin ibunya, yg jelas bukan saya). Kecewa sekali krn pihak manajemen tidak turun tangan dgn memberi kompensasi pindah kamar. Harusnya service hotel bintang 5 inisitiatif gitu dong kalo customer udah ngalamin hal gak enak bgini. Masa iya harus diminta sama customer nya dulu sambil marah2 (which is menguras tenaga). 2. Menu sarapan utk kelas hotel bintang 5 tidak variatif. Menu buffet standar dan hambar. Buah2an hanya 2 tmpt. Egg dan noodle corner. Sereal susu dan 2 jus. Roti dan kue jg sedikit. 3. Kalo mau cari makan diluar lumayan jauh dr jangkauan. Kalo beli di resto nya pun mahal bgt dan tidak variatif. Rasanya udah kebayang sih dr menu sarapan nya. 4. Lg renovasi mungkin ya jadi murah harga nya tp fasilitas tdk maksimal. Lainkali saya akan lbh berhati2 lg pilih hotel bintang 5 dgn harga yg sesuai bintang 5. 5. Exterior hotel bagus cakep kaya difoto. Pantai di belakang hotel nya tidak bs utk renang."
"35.","Shah Aun Hussain","53","2025-07-01","5","I don’t know why the reviews of this property are so bad! For the price, I don’t think you can get a better 5 star experience. Yes the property is a bit away and you need some commute vehicle to roam around, but that’s the point! It’s secluded!!! And it’s a bit old but the staff is super helpful and friendly and makes up for any problem you may face. Also tried cheesecake at their Restuarant - one of the best I’ve had around"

"37.","rahul singh","4","2025-05-31","1","Hotel Review – Extremely Disappointing Stay I recently stayed at this hotel for 3 days, and unfortunately, the experience was far from what I expected—especially from a property that claims to be 5-star. From the very first day, we encountered issues with the air conditioning. It wasn’t working properly, and we ended up sweating through the night. Despite reporting the issue, it wasn’t resolved. On the third day, we were moved to a different room, only to face the exact same AC problem. We had to sit in the lobby for over an hour while they attempted to fix it—something that should have been addressed much earlier. The hygiene standards were appalling. We found a cockroach in the washroom, and when housekeeping came, the staff simply sprayed it with insecticide and left the mess behind. There was no effort to clean up or sanitize the area afterward. To add to the disappointment, the in-room entertainment was extremely limited. Out of 27 television channels, 7 were just advertisements for the resort itself. There was no smart TV or any modern amenities you’d expect from a hotel of this supposed caliber. Overall, our stay was extremely unpleasant. I would not recommend this hotel and strongly urge the management to seriously upgrade their facilities and services if they wish to meet even basic guest expectations, let alone those of a 5-star standard."

"39.","briannon micallef","8","2025-05-31","2","Me and my partner had booked 3 nights at this “5-star” resort and it was quite disappointing, we only stayed for 1 night because we just wanted to leave. The bed sheet had stains and was ripped. The tv remote didn’t work and very low tv quality, the mini fridge didn’t work, the safe wasn’t easy to operate and wanted to use my bank card to operate? Our room phone didn’t work and when we went to the front desk to let them know they said someone would come and look at it but no one ever came. We wanted to use the phone for room service so they gave us a what’s app phone number to contact which there was no answer/response. Again we went up to the front and let them know we contacted the what’s app number and that is when we finally got a response. That same room service took 1.5 hours to get to our room. There was construction going on which made the beach pool (main pool) unavailable and we weren’t made aware of this when checking in. There was no spoon in the room to stir your coffee/tea. Overall it does not seem like a 5-star resort. We have stayed in 3-star resorts that have been much better. The pro’s would be that the staff were very friendly and they had a lovely breakfast with lots of different food options. Would not recommend!"

"44.","Firmanila 'Pila' Ratnawati","44","2025-07-01","1","Rating 1 ini untuk pihak tamansari sementara rating 5 untuk para staff dan pihak jivva yang sudah membantu saya di tengah situasi urgent setelah DITELANTARKAN oleh pihak tamansari. Saya sebagai owner dijanjikan pembaruan point pada tanggal 1 juni 2025. Namun nyatanya point tidak masuk ke akun condotel saya sampai tanggal 2. Tidak ada komunikasi, tidak ada notifikasi. Nomor tenant relation tidak aktif karena alasan bukan jam kerja. Untungnya saya ditolong pihak jivva yang inisiatif mengalokasikan booking saya ke tanggal yang tersedia. Pihak tamansari GAGAL berkomunikasi dengan saya kalau ada kerusakan sistem yang menyebabkan ketidaktersediaan poin. Dan saya sebagai owner sangat rugi waktu, materi, dan emosional. Ketika mereka merespon pun responnya telat, lama, dan template. Di luar itu pengelolaan building di jivva juga BURUK. Saya yang punya properti lain dari tamansari sejujurnya sudah tidak asing dan kaget lagi dengan kelakuan mereka. Kerusakan di mana2, maintenance gak kelar2, you name it. Kulkas di kamar saya bukannya dingin malah panas. Mini barnya juga kalah sama hotel murah di Bali😂😂😂 yang bener aja resort bintang 5 kopi di mini barnya cuma nescafe yang sesachetnya ga sampe dua ribuan? Bahkan ga ada pemanis non gula kayak stevia atau tropicana. Ga ada sendok teh ready di kamar juga, cuma ada stirring rod yang lebih cocok buat jus. Also no hand towels... really? Untungnya staff2 di JIVVA ramah, professional, dan cepat tanggap. Lumayan jadi point plus di tengah keminusan. Sayang sebenernya karena tempat jni punya potensi buat menarik turis tapi pengelolaannya ampas."

Air panas sempat bermasalah, tapi diselesaikan dengan baik oleh maintenance.. Oh, selama di sana, lift sempat mati 1.5 hari, jadi lumayan juga olahraga naik sampai lantai 3.. Dan saat malam kedua, seperti terasa goncangan-goncangan ringan pada gedung (semacam gempa lokal), karena laut sedang pasang, tapi so far so good, bisa tidur nyenyak.."

The breakfast was delicious with a wide variety of options. The facilities were top-notch, and I especially enjoyed the fun activities like the market visit and cooking class. Honestly, I highly recommend this place and would definitely come back to stay here again with my family."

"54.","A","20","2025-05-31","2","Unfortunately, my experience was not satisfying. I booked a Superior Room, but it felt old and tired, so I had to upgrade to a Deluxe Room which was beautiful! The place out of the room was full of insects and lizards which was very disturbing. Although the views were stunning I couldn’t enjoy the facilities because of the insects . I understand it’s common in Bali but at the least the restaurant should be clean and insect-free. There’s only one restaurant with a very limited menu and since the hotel is far from everything, you have no choice but to eat there most of the time. My room had a balcony but I couldn’t enjoy it for even a minute because of the lizards. There were four of them living on my balcony and I had to keep the door closed the entire time to make sure they didn’t come into the room !!! I also wanted to try the spa but it had a bad smell so I canceled my massage appointment. Pros: • Beautiful sea view • Nature sounds all around • Very friendly, professional and responsive staff • Quiet and peaceful ( perfect for relaxation ) • The food at the restaurant is good, even though the menu is limited Overall: I only recommend this place if you’re okay with insects and very big lizards !! Otherwise it’s not for you."

"56.","Vicky Dutta","5","2025-05-31","4","The property is very beautiful with nice surroundings. We took ocean view suite, but as it is near the sea shore, most of the sea facing building gave earthquake like tremors throught the stay, and it was very unpleasant for the first night to sleep, though they changed our room for the next night to another one still felt tremors with less effect. Both the rooms were very specious and well organised with a beautiful view. All the staff were very friendly and greeted us with smile. Overall had a pleasant stay."
"57.","Spencer Plews","1","2025-07-01","1","Where to begin? 1. Bed bugs everywhere. Both my partner and I were COVERED in bites in the first night. 2. Most of the facilities were closed, even the pool at the 5 star resort. 3. The private pool have clearly never been cleaned, the water was a creamy white colour with chunks of mold and even a used bandaid circulating around from the previous guest. 3. The door frame had fallen off, which prevented our door from shutting and locking. A staff member came and fixed it by hitting it with his hand a couple times, and then processed to tell us not to push the door shut too hard or it will fall off and my door won't be able to lock and shut. Along with this, the lock only had 1 of the 4 screws in it. 4. A banister on the 4th floor being held on by 1 screw, with rotting wood supposedly keeping us safe. 5. Mold in the bathrooms, no hot water from the taps, dirty cutlery in the rooms, blood on the pillow cases and excrement & mold on the curtains. 6. The ceiling has huge holes in it from a storm a couple months ago, which they are fixing. 7. Server at the restaurant speaking little to no English, getting our order wrong four times (vegetarian but got chicken 4 times) and getting ANGRY at us when we asked for the correct dish. 8. Our meals would take atleast 1 hour to be cooked and delivered, and at most 2 hours and 15 minutes (1 rice dish, 1 desert), both soaking wet and clearly had sat on a bench for a period of time before being served. 9. Perhaps the worst of all, a staff member promising 2x 1.500.000 vouchers for watching a 90 minute promotional video. Their iPad to watch the video was only available on the last day we were at the hotel, so we were told we can charge things to our room and they will be credited at the end of the trip. This was not the case and after my wife ordered room service at 10pm, the staff member forced her to pay, refusing to leave the room (regardless of what she said about the credit to the room, as told by the staff member.) When I brought this up with the reception, they had no idea what I was talking about. They got the manager, who BLAMED the staff member who is not actually employed by Wyndham and is a contractor for another business, even though he was in a staff outfit inside the reception area, dressed in the exact same clothes as the other staff. The manager offered 1000 apologies, insisted he would resolve it but to no avail. Overall the worst, most disgusting hotel I have ever been to. Uneducated staff, bad management and building and facilities that clearly get no maintenance and no cleaning between guests. I will not be returning to any Wyndham hotels and will inform others the same. STAY AWAY!"
"58.","Phil Town","33","2025-07-01","1","This hotel claims to be 5-star, but it’s far from it. The property is dilapidated, propped up by scaffolding, and feels neglected. The surrounding area offers little to do, leaving the beach restaurant as the only option. The restaurant staff, seemingly inexperienced high school interns, struggle to handle customer demands. While the rooms are clean, they’re worn, with scuffed walls and peeling paint. The toilet paper is subpar, worse than what you’d find in a public restroom. The laundry service is overpriced, outsourced to the local village, and returned damp after a two-day wait. This place could improve with significant investment from the owners, but as it stands, it’s a disappointing experience."
"59.","Marilyn Plews","1","2025-07-01","1","Horrific Stay at Wyndham Property – AVOID! Our recent stay at a Wyndham property was an unmitigated disaster, easily the worst hotel experience we've ever had. From unsanitary conditions to dangerous maintenance issues and deceptive practices, this hotel is a health and safety hazard. Upon arrival, my partner and I were immediately covered in bed bug bites. The private pool was a biohazard, filled with creamy white water, mold chunks, and even a used bandage. Inside our room, we found blood on pillowcases, excrement and mold on curtains, and dirty cutlery. The bathroom had mold and no hot water. Adding to the squalor, the ceiling had large holes from a previous storm. The hotel's structural integrity was alarming. Our door frame was broken, preventing it from shutting and locking properly, with a fix that involved a staff member hitting it and warning us not to push it too hard. A banister on the 4th floor was precariously held by a single screw with rotting wood. Service was equally appalling. Restaurant staff had limited English, leading to four incorrect orders (vegetarian meals replaced with chicken), and became angry when we requested the correct dish. Meals took an unacceptably long time (1-2 hours) and were often delivered cold and wet. Perhaps the most egregious issue involved a deceptive promotion. A staff member promised two 1,500,000 IDR vouchers for watching a promotional video. When the iPad for the video was only available on our last day, we were told we could charge items to our room and they would be credited. This was a lie. My wife was forced to pay for room service late at night by a staff member who refused to leave the room. When we brought this up with reception, the manager blamed a contractor (despite him being in uniform) and offered empty apologies without resolving the issue. This hotel is a testament to uneducated staff, poor management, and a complete lack of maintenance and cleaning. We will not be returning to any Wyndham hotels and strongly advise others to stay away!"

"62.","Jessie Aussie","97","2025-03-31","5","Our family has been living in Australia for over six years. Life in a big city can sometimes be really stressful, so we decided to find a less crowded resort with all the facilities we need as a family, such as restaurants, a nice pool, various activities for our little one, and wellness treatments. Wyndham Tamansari Jivva Resort Bali seemed to offer the perfect blend of beach and rice field surroundings in one place. Staying here is very comfortable, as the hotel provides spacious rooms with beautiful balcony spots. Not only that, you can hear the sound of waves and might even catch the sunset directly from your balcony. With a special promotion of less than $100 AUD per night, including breakfast, this month, it’s really worth trying, especially if you love nature and prefer not to venture far. Another good thing about this place is its proximity to Bali Safari and Nusa Penida. If you’re looking for accommodation options, this place is the answer."

The restaurant is really nice and unique. The location is a bit odd though. It's in the middle of nowhere. It's perfect if you don't want to be in all the hustle and bustle of the busier areas but you're cut off and restricted to eating and drinking in the resort. The beach is black sand and the ocean isn't the nicest. But the pool is lovely so that might make up for it. The location is good for visiting the Safari Park, zoo, and waterfalls. It wouldn't be a deal breaker for me but I know the area well. All in All very nice hotel with excellent staff."

"74.","Jeeshan George","143","2024-12-31","5","A fabulously designed property! It’s right on the beach with direct access to the shore. Large rooms, with private pool or jacuzzi, depending on the floor. Really nice swimming pool, apart from a smaller pool further inside. It’s got everything you will want at a beach resort. The restaurant it breathtaking, with views of the ocean. Designed to look like a large tropical hut, it serves a mix of local and international cuisine. Food is about average, especially the breakfast… but full marks for effort and service. But, there are things that need to improve. Maintenance is poor. You can see several rooms that are out of service for various issues. The electricity keeps going off and you need to get them to fix it. There are damages to almost all parts of the resort. You generally get a feeling that it’s a really well designed property that’s not kept with time. Location is a bit odd too… nothing is close by except the beach. No restaurants around you can walk to, so you are stuck eating at the resort each night of your stay. If you are really looking for a private vacation property near the beach, this is a great choice to be at. If you are in Bali to party, this may not work for you. We had a really good time here as a family and would love to be back here. I hope the management spends some time and effort maintaining this lovely resort"

Our issues were that the room, had a strong mold smell. The small fridge was not working, we told them, they replaced the Fridge, and it still didn't work. I believe the outlet didn't have power but whatever. The resort is on the beach, but it is not a beach that is inviting, it is a black sand beach and is not what you think. There is NOTHING around the resort, we were told that the closest village to get food and drinks were a 20 min drive. We did not have a car. The resorts only restaurant had a limited menu and no alcohol when we were there due to some issue. The staff was friendly and kind, but we couldn't see us staying there for the week that we booked with nothing. I hope that after the much-needed renovations, this place is better."
"79.","kadek dharmawan","19","2025-05-31","1","a few weeks ago I visited a restaurant near the beach. This was my first time there because my child wanted to swim. Because it was a 5-star hotel, of course my expectations were high for the service that would be given. However, that hope disappeared when I wanted to go home and pay for food and drinks at the cashier, the cashier staff was very curt, unfriendly and impolite. When I wanted to ask how much tax is charged, and the answer was that I was asked to look directly at the computer screen while leaving me alone. Omg, seriously?? This will be my first and last experience visiting there. Sorry, I gave a bad rating because it is in accordance with what I experienced."

"82.","Roy Lockwood","51","2025-03-31","5","A luxurious tropical paradise - 49 nights at the Wyndham Tamansari Jivva resort in Bali. Staying at the Wyndham Tamansari Jivva resort was nothing short of a wonderful experience. From the moment I arrived I was welcomed with warm Balinese hospitality and it only got better from there. Situated along the east coast of the island, this resort offers a perfect blend of luxury, comfort and serenity. Beautiful gardens and well appointed rooms made every day seem effortless. My accommodation was impeccably maintained with a spacious layout and a private plunge pool where I could literally soak in the breathtaking sea views. The staff make this hotel truly amazing. A grateful shout out to Yogi and the guys for keeping my room spotlessly clean with everything I needed. Ariani, Dedi and Dewi in the restaurant for looking after me so well. Their smiles I shall remember forever. Executive Chef Gusti is a wonderful ambassador for the hotel. His enthusiasm for his restaurant, and the resort was truly special. He also went out of his way to make me some of the best food I have had in a long time. Head of Security Nyoman too was really wonderful, as was everyone. My stay was seamless and totally enjoyable from day one to the morning I left. The Spa treatments were divine, offering a perfect mix of relaxation and rejuvenation. The resort offers a peaceful relaxed location away from the tourist crowds which allowed me to relax, whilst still being close enough to explore the wonderful culture this island has to offer. After 49 nights here it truly felt like a home from home and I will never forget my Balinese adventure here. “For thy sweet love remembered, such wealth brings” Thank you Wyndham ❤️"

"87.","Sashi De Mel","3","2025-05-01","1","The hotel is FALLING APART and is a lawsuit waiting to happen!!!! The roof is falling apart, the pool has a deck that the wood is so worn out that if your leg falls through (about to happen) it'll slice through your entire leg. It's unfortunate because it has so much potential, but it's a HUGE health and safety hazard. The staff is really lovely and trying to do the best with what they have but what we realised is the management/owners clearly do not care if the building falls to the ground with all the guests still in it. They also don't care that all the food and drinks are not available and refuse to give staff the authority to order any more stock (we were told). Overall just wouldn't recommend, SPECIALLY if you have kids, you'll be VERY disappointed."

"92.","Muhammad Gohar Shafique","194","2024-12-31","4","Price: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ The price was incredibly affordable, which was a big plus, especially considering it's a resort. While we had some expectations for more luxury, the value for money is still decent given the price point. Location: ⭐⭐⭐ We originally wanted to stay at the Safari Hotel, but since it was booked, we ended up choosing this resort. While it's a good option in the area, nearby activities are very limited. Our visit to Bali Safari was a highlight, but beyond that, there wasn’t much to do in the immediate vicinity. Fun/Entertainment: ⭐⭐⭐ The beach at the resort was definitely a standout—amazing waves that were both thrilling and relaxing at the same time. The pools were also good, providing a nice place to unwind. However, we were expecting more in terms of on-site entertainment and activities. If you're looking for a lot to do nearby, options are somewhat limited. Facilities: ⭐⭐⭐ The resort itself felt a bit old and not as well-maintained as we had hoped. The building shows its age, and the overall upkeep wasn’t up to the standard we were expecting. On the plus side, we had a nice dinner at the restaurant, and the pools were enjoyable, but in terms of luxury and attention to detail, it was just okay. Overall Experience: ⭐⭐⭐ Wyndham Tamansari Jivva Resort Bali is a good, affordable option in the area, but it didn’t quite meet our expectations for quality and luxury. While the beach and pools were enjoyable, and the dinner was good, the resort feels outdated and lacks the refinement you'd expect from a high-end resort. If you're looking for an affordable stay and aren’t too focused on luxury, it’s a fine choice, but we were left wanting a bit more from the experience."
"93.","Xo Quetzal","48","2024-12-31","4","Great for quick rest! No swimming at the beach and pool under maintenance. The price was fair for what the hotel offered. The restaurant was fantastic as was the restaurant staff. Front desk staff was a bit pretentious. The smaller pool was clean and well maintained. Great shower and comfortable bed.

Gorgeous sunset view and nice walking path with very friendly locals."

The rooms are clean, the atmosphere is quiet, and the service is excellent, making it a relaxing place to stay. However, the parking area is a bit limited, which could be inconvenient if you’re driving. As for breakfast, it’s quite standard and can get repetitive if you're staying for an extended period. It would be nice if they added more variety, especially some local Balinese dishes, to enrich the experience. Overall, it’s a great choice for anyone staying in the area."
"95.","Anggara Wisesa","35","2025-01-31","1","Not disability-friendly. Before booking, we specifically inquired about wheelchair accessibility and were assured that the hotel was accessible. However, upon arrival, we discovered that several areas, such as the restaurant, were NOT wheelchair-friendly—an important detail that was not disclosed. Additionally, the floors were slippery, posing a safety risk, and a bathroom mat was not provided initially. As a result, we had to cut our stay short and relocate to another hotel, losing two nights without any compensation, apart from an apology from the manager. This experience was disappointing and disrupted our family holiday plans, which is unacceptable for a FIVE-star establishment."

Kamar sangat bersih, luas, dan dilengkapi dengan fasilitas modern. Tempat tidurnya sangat nyaman, membuat istirahat saya benar-benar berkualitas.👍👍 Staf hotel sangat ramah, profesional, dan selalu siap membantu. Proses check-in dan check-out juga cepat dan efisien. Sarapan paginya bervariasi dan rasanya enak, mulai dari menu lokal hingga internasional. Fasilitas seperti kolam renang, gym, dan spa benar-benar terawat dengan baik. Suasana hotel sangat tenang, cocok untuk liburan atau perjalanan bisnis. Harga memang lebih tinggi, tapi sebanding dengan kualitas pelayanan dan fasilitas yang diberikan. Saya pasti akan kembali menginap di sini dan merekomendasikan hotel ini kepada teman dan keluarga saya.🙌🙌🙌"

Cuman beberapa experience yg bikin nggak perfect yaitu drainase kamar mandi buruk. Hotelnya luas, minusnya kalau makan bisa jalan jauh pun rasa makanannya so so aja. kalau bawa mobil juga parkirannya jauh banget di basement lewat lobby yang beda gedung. Mepet pantai banget minusnya deburan ombak bener2 kenceng banget bikin tidur kurang nyenyak. Tapi untuk viewnya mantep sih. Experience yang bagus. Cocok buat honeymoon, tidak cocok buat yg liburan dengan agenda padat wkwkwkkwkwwk"
"101.","Toni Froia Drummond","164","2024-12-31","3","Hmm where do I start… loved the location and the peacefulness of the resort and the sound of the waves crashing. However felt it is in need of some major management changes. What I saw; cook in the kitchen spitting on the floor, waiter kicking a cat and laughing about it, waitress throwing rocks at a dog. The food leaves a lot to be desired. The buffet breakfast was awful-flies, food not topped up, watermelon dropped on the floor where I nearly slipped over, reported and nothing was done, the coffee tasted like dirty water. The majority of workers did not understand or speak English so if you asked for something they just smiled or laughed. No one person seemed in charge at the restaurant, lots or workers standing around but nothing being checked or topped up or cleaned up. The room was very nice and clean but, we could not lock the back door which backed onto the rice fields. The room was supposed to have coffee/ tea facilities but did not, the tiny fridge did not cool anything and was located in a cupboard and seemed to be overheating. Our private pool was dirty and the water very low. The ladder was dangerous, rusty and the wrong size to safely enter the pool. I asked reception if they could get someone to fill the water in the pool which they did but the following day it was low again, so I assume it had a leak ?"

"103.","Phillip Kapeleris","39","2024-12-31","5","We had a most pleasant stay at the resort, and every interaction with the staff was hospitable 🌞 Our driver to and from the resort was lovely, the staff were always pleasant and attentive, and checking in and out was straightforward. As there is not much else to eat around the resort, we were delighted to find a separate vegan menu with plenty of plant-based options 🌱 The staff also accommodated any dietary requests we had. The rooms were spacious, looked like the photos, and kept very cool despite the heat. A boardwalk runs alongside the black sand beach, and you can hear the crashing waves around the resort. It’s to be noted that it’s not a beach for swimming, as it is quite dangerous; there are many pools in the resort, though. Two nights we stayed, as a stopping point between travelling, and we would certainly stay again 🙏🏼"

Staffnya ramah2, kami dibantu sama Mba Risa dari mulai check in sampai diantar ke kamar, dan Bli (yg lupa nanya namanya) saat sampai membantu menurunkan barang² dari Mobil. Fasilitasnya lengkaaap, viewnya bagus, healing disini cocok banget. Poolnya juga gak cuma 1, ada yg di pinggir pantai dan bisa sampai malam. Kids Friendly. Sarapan utk anak 7th kena charge ya 100ribu-an. Cuma banyak Anjing, sempat hampir diendus pas lagi di pantai padahal ada majikannya 😅 (tapi so far Anjingnya gak ada yg langsung ngejar kalo liat manusia, msh aman lah asal menjauh aja untuk kita umat muslim biar gak tersentuh). Minimal 2 malam menginap disini sih biar puas menikmati keheningannya."

"108.","Steve Lewis","34","2024-12-31","3","Good points: Room was clean, Comfortable bed, Good shower, Friendly staff Food was quite good (but not Indonesian prices) Bad points: This hotel shouldn't really be open, it's long overdue a renovation. -The roof is falling down above the pool area, right above the sund beds, could fall and kill someone. -The wood is rotten around the pool, soon someone will fall through and cut their leg open. -Lots of loose tiles around and inside the pool -The lake/swamp stinks -the sea is very dangerous here, don't even think about swimming.. -the whole place is falling apart and very aged -breakfast was 15 euros p.p. and then for a bad cappuccino I was charged extra on top, juice is extra too. Not very 5*... -no restaurants near by so you have to eat in the hotel To the management, why not renovate this hotel and reopen when it's ready?"

"120.","Umesh W","789","2024-12-31","3","This hotel is located at a very beautiful location, away from the crowds and other hotels. Actually, when you are driving to the hotel, you drive through a very local, scenic road, passing small houses and rice fields. The reception is simple yet beautiful. There are few rice fields around the hotel, which are beautiful to see. The hotel itself is a bit rundown and could use some maintenance to get it back to shape, especially when you consider that it’s a Wyndham. The rooms are comfortable but, requires maintenance, especially the bathrooms, they require a lot of maintenance. We did pay for the breakfast and it was horrible, to say the least. The buffet was poor and very little in terms of local good. My POV, I come to Bali for Bali/Indonesian food, not to eat bread with toast. The restaurant food is a bit pricey but, lacks taste, not worth it in my opinion. The beaches are beautiful with black sand but, not allowed to swim for some reason. The beaches also have a lot of pollution/plastics. We used the pools, they definitely need some maintenance, broken tiles and rotting wood. The fitness Center is in good condition. The staff at the hotel are amazingly nice, sincere and very helpful, beautiful smiles."
"121.","Shannon Johnstone","7","2024-12-31","1","The service is incredibly poor, I would not suggest staying here We booked a couple massage 2 weeks out from our stay and it was confirmed. The morning of, the hotel cancelled it because they had a “last minute group booking”. We explained we had already booked, and this was the only time that suited. When we arrived at the hotel to check in, they tried again to shuffle us straight off for the massage before we even got the key card. Finally when we went for our agreed time, they pushed us back a half hour after we had already been waiting 15minutes. The massage itself was nice, except the masseurs were on their phones throughout. There was also an issue with payment where the eftpos didn’t work, and they wanted us to go get cash out to pay. They agreed we can pay in the morning, 5 minutes later front desk called to ask us to bank transfer, even though we were told we can’t add it to the room as they are separate services. The restaurant- they had hardly any of the stock of drinks on their menu and pushed their local spirit. Food- I ordered the plant based meatballs and spaghetti, and they gave me meat which I only realised AFTER I had eaten one. They promptly took it away and replaced it with my correct meal, and said they would give us complimentary drinks to apologise. When we got the bill, we had to pay for the whole thing. The facilities- the decking around the garden pool is in major need of replacing, nails sticking up and timber not attached, it’s a big safety hazard. The fridge in our room did not keep anything cold We thought we had booked a nice resort for our last night in Bali, but was very disappointed"

Have called the receptionist but nothing changed and they even did not mention at all about resolution. It’s like losting things here is obvious 😔. Extreme irresponsibility! - The room was shaking upon every strong wind blows. Cannot sleep much at night due to the vibration of the room. - Jivva beach restaurant was not as expected. Serving time was too long. Limited number of foods and drinks. I will never comeback here again and not recommend to anyone! It’s only 2-3 star hotel."

Very close to the beach (black sand on the beach) but you can’t swim. Place provides with two swimming pools ( one is under construction atm) and gym and spa facilities. Food is 7/10 at the restaurant. Did not like the breakfast at all. Could be better. Room is very spacious and bed is comfortable. Toilet is 5/10 clean. Cons : There were cockroaches and ants in the room. Air conditioner was set to 18 but I was sweating and had to sleep without a top. Room fridge was not cooling any bottles of water we put in. It’s a nice place. Hopefully they will be better."

"130.","Tiarne F","8","2024-12-31","3","Our stay at this Bali resort was a last-minute decision after a typhoon disrupted our Vietnam trip. While the property had potential, several issues impacted our experience. Pros: Beautiful beachfront location Two pools in lovely settings Grand architecture, albeit showing signs of age Cons: Beach not suitable for swimming (research beforehand is advisable) Room amenities: Fridge didn't cool properly, air conditioning was unreliable Pool maintenance: Lack of accessible towels, visible debris in the water Cleanliness: Rubbish accumulation around pool areas Location: Relatively isolated from nearby towns and attractions The resort's facilities, while impressive in design, appeared to need renovation and better upkeep. The pools, though attractively situated, lacked basic amenities like towels and regular cleaning. More waste bins could help address the litter problem. Due to the isolated location, we relied heavily on food delivery services when we didn't want to dine at the on-site restaurant. Future guests should consider this when booking, especially if they prefer easy access to various dining options. In comparison to our experiences in Vietnam, we found the hospitality and cleanliness standards here to be lacking. While Bali remains a beautiful destination, this particular property didn't meet our expectations for comfort and service. Suggestions for improvement: Enhance room amenities maintenance Improve pool cleanliness and provide accessible towels Increase the number of waste bins in common areas Consider offering shuttle services to nearby towns For future travelers: Thoroughly research the location and amenities before booking, especially regarding beach access and proximity to other attractions."

"133.","Salv Madrid","19","2024-12-31","4","There are two reasons why I cant give this hotel 5 stars: 1) The main pool is out of service, it looks like it has been for quite some time… and it is currently not being worked on. It’s a massive eyesore. 2) Only one restaurant available, with very slow service and food that is average at best. The rooms have been recently renovated and they are lovely, the location is amazing, and the black sand beach is stunning. If you are gonna stay here for several days, hire a local driver so you can get some decent meals from the towns nearby.

"136.","Putu Andika","3","2024-12-31","2","Positive Review: The security staff were very friendly and helpful during the unloading process, directing parking, and even going down to the basement to ensure there was a parking space. The staff during breakfast were very welcoming, making us feel well received. The room was clean, the air conditioning was cold, and everything functioned well. The garden was well-maintained and neat. Negative Review: I checked in at 1 PM, and although there were about 6 or 7 people at the reception, none approached my wife to help with the luggage. During the check-in process, I was handled by a trainee (which I didn't mind), but my reservation could not be found. Eventually, a female staff member (Puri or Putri, wearing glasses) took over, but the reservation still could not be found. Despite confirming with the reservation, they couldn't find it. My ID was already taken, and the female staff member was very unfriendly and unhelpful, making me feel stereotyped as a local Balinese. They should learn about hospitality from the security staff. The dinner staff were also unfriendly. When my child ordered spaghetti meatballs (from the kids' menu), they offered vegan or regular options. When I asked what vegan meant, the staff confirmed that the kids' menu only had the regular option, showing a lack of product knowledge. When my wife asked if the grilled chicken included rice, the staff told her to check the description on the menu (very unprofessional). Even worse, the male staff member was also unfriendly towards us locals. When foreign guests arrived, they were greeted warmly and treated differently. The worst part was when I ordered 2 Coca-Colas, but after paying, we found out we were charged for 4. Were they trying to steal from us? We had to wait again to get a refund. The physical hotel is very nice, but we did not have the experience we expected. Only the security staff and the ladies carrying offerings greeted us when we passed by."

Nice jacuzzi on the balcony but the lack of warm water makes it not nice to use. Swimming pool isn’t clean enough. Friendly staff in the restaurant area. Klungkung is quite remote, nothing happening in the area so good for a relaxing stay, not if you look for excitement. A pity that there were big bloodstains in the very dirty mattress protector. Dirty and gives a bad feeling to find it out after waking up. A mattress protector is easy to wash and should be washed when there are these kind of stains. (Housekeeping, give more attention). If this wasn’t the case, 5* for the rooms, now only 3 and 4* for service instead of 5."

The breakfast so so, not much option, but the bread freshly made I think, the view from the pool beach is good but maybe fix the services and give free deodorant to all the staff... If I’m being honest, this is one of the worst 5 stars hotel I’ve ever stayed in, I booked the cheapest room since I came for work and all, stay for 4 nights, since the first night I told them that the toilet is leaking, ask them to fix it, they fix it but the leakage keep happening, so after that they probably just wipe all the water that came from the toilet when I’m leaving for my activity. On my last night they offer to move me to other room, what’s the point? 🤣🤣, what a joke for 5 stars hotel."

"149.","Joe","81","2024-12-31","3","The Wyndham bought this property off another hotel chain i believe around 2 years ago and are renovating it. I think some blocks have already been done, even though value for money £30 a night the rooms and building is OLD, everything’s marked scuffed and needs doing up. In lobby areas and rooms. There is reno work happening above the seafront pool and its extremely dangerous, we witnessed something fall off the scaffolding and nearly hit one of the workers whilst working on the roof. The food in the restaurant is ok but tasteless - the problem is location. There is NOTHING around at all. Not even a warung so only stay here if you have a car or bike. Also if you want to get a grab - get it from the atm on the side of the property and not from the hotel front as they will not come - local taxi who charge ridiculous amounts will not allow pickup. The pool was dirty it had grime in it, the gym has 3 ac units but not cool at all. Overall it was basic, and the room was clean, it just needs work done."

Kebetulan saya booking yang kamarnya langsung ke pool yang kecil, bukan yang dekat pantai. Enak bangeet bisa santai di beranda belakang sambil ngopi bareng istri sementara anak bermain di kolam renang. Untuk sarapan buffet lumayan enak juga. Cuma saran aja, untuk staf hotel lebih sering cek furniture. Di kamar saya raknya rusak dan agak susah untuk dikunci"

"152.","Ali Wafdi","95","2023-12-31","2","The reason I'm giving this hotel 2 stars is because of the staff, otherwise I would have given it 0 stars. Everyone at the hotel was really friendly and helpful. We had to check out at 3am, when I tried to book a Grab there was no driver.The gentleman at the front desk called the hotel taxi and we were able to make it on time. The hotel is really far from everything, no restaurants or cafes in the area, we had to take a Grab for more than +1 hour to get to good places. The food at the hotel restaurant was way below average. The room was OK, but it had an ant infestation. They went into our snack and bit us in our bed during the night. The pools are really dirty and don't make you want to swim. There are a lot of stray dogs around the pool and they can come up to you, so we couldn't stay there with our toddler. Also, the hotel is not stroller friendly, you can't push your stroller to get to the restaurant or the beach. The beach is not usable, but it's good if you want to relax in front of it."

We were blown away with the views, the amazing food and the extremely courteous and nice staff. Every single detail right from our check in was taken care of! We stayed for 8 days and we had the most relaxing stay. The rooms were huge, airy and had stunning views and extremely comfortable. We tried almost everything they had on the menu and they were all absolutely DELICIOUS and very reasonably priced. The breakfast buffet was very lavish and yum! The icing on the cake was the staff. Every single person working on the property will greet you and ensure whatever you need is taken care of in a matter of a few minutes. I was blown away by the hospitality and kindness shown. A special thanks to Fredy for taking good care of us!!! Thank you for making our stay so memorable and so special. I highly recommend this place for a stay and will definitely be staying here whenever I come back to Bali! 😍"

I chose to bring my meal to the room, and the staff packed it for me (you also have the option to dine in the restaurant). Regarding the room, it wasn’t very spacious, but it was tidy and well-maintained. The television, shower, and phone were all in good working order. The view was lovely, with plenty of plants along the road that added a 'Bali vibe.' The pool and beach club near Lepang Beach were great additions. One interesting thing I noticed during the night was a slight tremor, possibly from the waves—felt like a tiny earthquake."
"161.","Dayna Tirado","70","2023-12-31","4","Great value at the beach. We were concerned after reading some reviews and having a non refundable reservation but we enjoyed our weekend at this resort. We had a oceanfront king suite and our room was fine. The WiFi was good, bed and pillows comfortable, hot water plentiful and breakfast buffet great. I was surprised all the staff spoke wonderful English (much better than my Indonesian!) and we were given professional and friendly service by everyone. The hotel has definitely seen better days but there were signs of repairs and upgrades being done. We especially loved walking the brick walkway along the oceanfront. I may not rate this a five star but it was a good value and we would recommend."

"163.","T. Hines","53","2024-12-31","2","Wifi was very slow on my iphone and windows pc. TV stations are analogue and many of them heavily disturbed. Rooms are modern but do not have anything special or local. To me this room could be in Heathrow, Austin, Hongkong, Basically it felt like any business room... the beach with its black sand is nice, but you can't stay there. Massive waves and swimming is not allowed, would not be possible for me either. As we stayed, a lot of maintenance was going on. No umbrellas at the pool. I thought that prices at the only all-in-one Restraurant/Pool-bar/Buffet were extremely high for Bali and above average. The hotel is not near to anything, I was not able to walk anywhere - you need to call a taxi, we had to wait for a long time before transportation arrived. If you do not request special deposit treatment during checkin, you won't be able to charge anything to the room, this means: alway carry money with you if you want to get a drink or somthing if you do not have deposit (never experienced this process before at any hotel I stayed so far) Staff is generally very friendly but does not speak english very well."

Sampo dan sabun kosong. Minta refil tp hanya di refil sabun itupun pum nya tidak dibuka jd kami kesulitan mengeluarkan sabun. Sementara tempatnya permanen. Water heater tidak menyala. Pertama mandiin anak jam 15.00 water hetaer tidak menyala lalu saya mandi jam 17.00 tetep tidak menyala. Saya komplen ke front desk menanyakan water heater katanya standar kami memang air nya tidak terlalu hangat. Wahhh parah saya khawatir bgt karna saya bawa bayi.. bayi kami gmn mandi klo airnya sedingin itu.. saat malam ac tidak menyala suami tidak bisa tidur karna kegerahan kami panggil room service dan membetulkan ac dipagi buya jam 02.00 kami yg ingin istirahat dgn nyaman menjadi sangat terganggu. Lalu pagi jam 05.00 ac kembali bermasalah dan tidak nyala lagi. Kami panggil lg room servis dan dibetulkan kembali. Saat itu kami mnt tolong cek water heater krn air angat nya knp sangat tidak terasa hangat. Lalu operator tsbt mengecek water heater dan ternyata memang bermasalah water heaternya. Lalu saat mau memandikan bayi kami wastafel mampet tidak bisa dibuka tutup alirannya.. saat itu saya benar2 sudah muak dgn keadaan hotel ini.. tidak layak menjadi hotel bintang 5!!!! Udh jauh jauh kesini pgn menikmati malah jd repot"

"168.","Marcellinus Christian","20","2023-12-31","3","Jelas sekali hotel ini bukan bintang 5. Bintang 5 nya antara ngaku2 atau hasil kongkalikong. Hotel bintang 5 seharusnya memiliki lokasi sentral, fasilitas mumpuni termasuk restoran premium dan servis yg extraordinary.contoh bintang 5 itu seperti kempinski, st regis, six sense, four season, marriot, raffles, sofitel, mulia, dll 1. Lokasi : di daerah antah berantah 60 - 90 menit dr kota. Gak ada fasilitas wisata atau supermarket dan pusat perbelanjaan di dekatnya 2. Kamar kotor, kulkas gak nyala, ac sempat bermasalah, air panas mati. Amenities tidak konsisten. 1kamar tak ada sandal 3. Cek in Process : membutuhkan waktu sekitar 2 jam hingga jam 5 sore baru bs masuk. 4. Breakfast sangat chaos restoran hanya 1 dan tidak dapat menampung tamu. Breakfast start fr 6.30 - 10.00 namun sampai 9.30 masih banyak tamu yg tidak kebagian tempat dudUK sedangkan waktu sarapan hampir berakhir. 5.pantai hanya pajangan saja ga bs digunakan. Dan banyak warga yg bukan tamu hotel duduk di taman / anjungan area hotel 6. Kolam renang tidak bersih 7. Staff room service sangat tidak helpful suruh lihat menu di tv terus alih2 menjelaskan dan sangat tidak ramah 8. Menginap 2 malam namun kunci hanya berlaku 1 malam 9.harga. nah ini doang yang bintang 5. Harga makanan sama mahal dari marriot, renaissance, hyatt dan beberapa hotel bintang 5 beneran. 10. Hotelnya outdoor namun payung jarang tersedia. 11. Staff hotel mengutamakan para bule. Agak sentimen sama turis lokal Ga semuanya buruk namun jelas bukan bintang 5. Hotel ini bintang 3. Dan tolong jgn kata ramai jd excuse di semua sisi keterlambatan/error pelayanan. Atau hotel ini emang dipersiapkan untuk situasi sepi tamu?"

The 45 sq m² room is very spacious, facilities are all great, plus balcony with pool view. There's 2 pool in this hotel but there's hardly anyone swimmed there, i guess because the water is a bit dirty. The hotel is right in front of the beach and it's very relaxing to chill at sunset. All the staffs are really friendly and helpful. The food is a bit underwhelming tho"
"174.","Reneau Sai","20","2024-12-31","1","The restaurant would not charge the breakfast to the room and walked me all the way to the room to obtain the cash. This is not very guest friendly as they are expecting you to be walking around the hotel with cash with you at all times. My friend's room had just smoke fill up from an upstairs guest and had to switch rooms at midnight although advertised as no smoking hotel. Please think twice before booking. I recommend Hotel Komune down the road."

Cuman suara ombak aja yang kedengeran keras. Tapi masih lebih baik karena terdengar adem. Makanan disini enak2, harga standart hotel ya. Tapi untuk rasa memuaskan. Ada ATM juga di tepi pantai. Kayaknya 1-1 nya di bali deh. Terus soal kolam juga ada 2 macam. Yg tenang dekat dengan gym dan tempat yoga. Dan yg besar bgt deket sama laut. Untuk kamar. Besarrrr dan space nya enak dibuat santai. Ada jacuzzi nya juga. Untuk bathup nya besar dan spacious. Mantep, wifi bebas passowrd. Untuk pelayanannya ramah dan membantu semua staff nya. Saya juga berterimakasih karena walaupun agak cerewet meminta sesuatu hal kita tetep dipenuhi. Banyak wisatawan asing dan domestik yang nginep disana. Jadi ga sepi2 banget penghuninya. Grab disana juga dilarang. Kalau mau sewa mobil antar jemput. Minta di resepsionis nanti dipesankan. Aktivitas di hotel yang banyak nggak akan bikin kalian mager. Kecuali ga mau ikutan ya. Sewa sepeda bisa Gym bisa Jalan2 aja bisa Atau berenang bisa. Atau mau ikut kegiatan lain. Bisa disesuaikan di jadwal yang mereka pasang. Sukses selalu ya. 👍"

The location is near to the beach but unfortunately you can’t swim at the beach due to the high waves. Although the location is in the rural area, they provide you with a lot of facilities such gym, sauna/spa, restaurants, beach pool. The room is okay. It was quite cleaned when I enter the room, but there’s an issue in the shower when I leaved my room to explored the Klungkung city and came back I smell like pee in the shower pipe. Although at first when I entered the shower I don’t smell anything, but it was gone later at night and it doesn’t really bother me and I just rinsed it with their soap before taking a shower to get rid off the smell. The staff and service is great and friendly. Their gym equipments are quite variative. The food was okay and not too bad as well Overal give a 8/10"

All felt very odd especially as a female solo traveller. Rooms were great very spacious but need a deep clean.. floor was dirty and tiles grubby in bathroom Breakfast food was very good, different choices every day but dinner was poor.

"192.","Jess W","163","2023-12-31","3","The Resort is in the middle of farm lands which made it a bit difficult to get to. You must hire a private driver to get anywhere. The surrounding and atmosphere is pleasant and peaceful with working rice paddy right next to it. The concept is very nice but the maintenance leaves something to be desired. Everything was just a bit.... Moldy... Not enough to ruin the stay, but enough to get me to take a second look at everything before I sat down on it. The room itself was nice, I stayed there as part of my friend's wedding group so I assume we had the cheapest room but it was sufficient for two people. The breakfast buffet was great. It has different dishes everyday along with the continental breakfast staples that are there all the time. They also have made to order soup and egg station. This is the second favorite part of my time there. The favorite part is the staff. The staff were amazing. Everyone is friendly and leaves you wanting for nothing, yet were never hovering or over-bearing. The definition of stellar service. The beach club was nice, the black sand beach has nice calming wave sounds. Very relaxing if you want to get away from the city. However after a few days with nothing else to do there, I was done. Not really a place that makes me want to return, but also kind of enjoyed my time there."

Then they left my luggage and bags on the floor in the corner of the lobby while I was already in my room and had to wait for more than an hour to get my bags delivered to my room. The customer service is the worst I have ever experienced. The room service is also low. The receptionist is not responsive and I had to call for up to 5-8 times and just got an answer. It's unbelievable that I got a very bad and old towel. The room is spacious and has a beautiful view and that's the only good thing about this resort. The service and hospitality is lower than a 2 star hotel. If you are this and wanna stay in this resort please replan and I'm sure there are many other beautiful places with a cheaper price even."

Our group of 23 people had our transport arranged by the hotel, and they told us it was gonna be 5 Toyota Innovas. Turned out to be 4 Toyota Avanza & 1 Toyota Rush. Plus, we (the committee) already paid the rent with the hotel (with legitimate, official hotel invoice!) Yet, the local Balinese drivers asked more money from our group members! It's ridiculous as well as uncomfortable as eventually our group members had to pay extra money which have already been budgeted with the event committee. The hotel eventually refunded it, but psychologically wise, it was very bad and uncomfortable for both committee and the members."

Thankfully, we only used the room for sleeping. They gave us a free upgrade from a standard room to a suite with a garden view, but that was the only good thing at this hotel. I work as a receptionist in a hotel as well and let me tell you, this hotel is actually a 3 star hotel. The food here is one of the worst foods I ate on whole Bali. Hotel rooms and pools are in a poor condition. The balcony hot tub does not work at all... The cleaning is done very poorly. One night when we came back to the hotel, the bathroom was full ob bugs. The sofa had white old stains on it, which I could remove with a wet tissue - which tells me they don't clean it at all. In the nightstand there is one Hindu book and one holy bible (probably left over by a guest) which tells me they don't even check tre drawers when guests leave. We also had to put empty shower gels on the floor ao they changed them, otherwise they don't replace anything you use. When we left, the bell boy gave us a hand with two suitcases. Then he dragged one of the suitcases down the wall to the garage almost ruining it. When we came to the garage he fell over both suitcases, almost ruining them and the items that we bought... Hotel staff is otherwise very nice. But everything else is bad..."

Our room was ready on our arrival, but it was not very clean and the sheets had blood on them, and the fridge did not work. We were ‘upgraded’ to another room . At least this one didn’t have dirty sheets, the bathrooms are rundown and in need of a decent scrub . Our room pool , is dirty and the water is cloudy, I certainly wouldn’t want to soak in it .! The main pools are also dirty. The food is expensive for what they offer, I’m sure 20 years ago it may have been 5 star , now it might be 2 star. Do not book here you will be disappointed."

Dgn taksi biaya 300rban dr bandara tapi Puas bgt, kmrn kita pakai suite king samudra view dgn private pool, pas bgt dpt kamar yg pojok, double window, mantab bgt, kamar super bersih dan peralatan lengkap, nyaman, toilet bersih bgt, pemandangan dr kamar sungguh tdk terlupakan, suara ombak malam hari sampai menggetarkan kaca dan sedikit terasa agak gempa kecil menambah sensasi staycation bnr2 beda dr hotel2 mewah lain. Pizza nya mantab bgt. Sekitar hotel ada sawah, bnyk kerbau merumput, bener2 dpt pemandangan yg super wow."

Akhirnya matikan paksa cabut kabel. - Yang paling serem: lantai kamar bergetar terus seperti gempa setiap kali ombak laut datang. Bagi yang trauma gempa, sangat tidak rekomendasi utk kesini! Entah dulu penilaian keamanan dan keselamatan gimana kok bisa begini. Overall, tidak merekomendasikan!"

"204.","Elysia Tan","4","2023-12-31","1","Dr loby masi oke, tapi masuk ke dalam fasilitasnya sangat kurang. Bayangan saya bintang 4,5 jauh sekali. Baik dr service front office, kebersihan yg terutama. Kolam ada 2, tp semua kotor, bs dbilang berlumut. Kotor sekai, kondisi beach club jg kotor. Semua berdebu. Sy mbegerti ini dekat pantai, kotor atau terkena efek korosi pantai, tp ini benar2 jauh dr ekspektasi. Promosi influencer yg d instagram mgkn tidak bs dipercaya 100%. Makanan jg tidak oke. Harusnya menginap 2 malam, tp kami putuskan 1 malam. Karena kasurnya kotor, alergi anak dan sy keluar semua. Sewaktu checkout sy infokan keluhan tapi sepertinya tidak bs diterima, hanya blg kami selalu bersihkan tiap hari. Well, mgkin standarnya memang begini. Sy jrng sekali buat review, apalagi yg spti ini, tp karena tidak ada respon yg baik, ya sudah. Dan masalah orng yg cek in lama, ya kami jg mengalami. Jadi mgkin memang sop nya bgt."

Jaccuzi bernoda noda hitam , saya kira awalnya hotel ini murah dengan statement bintang 5, tapi dengan apa yg saya dapat kan yaah standart lah . Gym centre nya panas dan pengap .

"210.","Stefan B","132","2024-12-31","4","Good: + spacious rooms + greenery + sea shore (not very clean) + cleaning staff is very polite and precise + they switched off music that annoyed me (speaker if front of my room) + there's a lady in the reception that is exceptional. Bad: - the food in the restaurant is really the worst. and overpriced. - grab and gojek do not deliver to that location most of the time. it was impossible to order food, medicines, groceries. - the fridge was not working and it was really troublesome to get a working one. It took 2 days - noone has read my preferences when I was booking the room on Agoda - there's a lot of mismanagement and miscommunication in the hotel. tip to the customers: get a scooter, the surroundings are very peaceful, but secluded tip to the hotel staff: don't lie to your customers that the hotel is fully booked, it's very easy to check that. you lose your face."

It feels like they are jealous No view from pool or restaurant Room only has 2 towels No hand towels or hair dryer or bathrobs which is essential in a 5 star hotel NO HOT WATER IN THE SHOWER OR SINK COCKROACH WAS IN THE TOWEL IN THE MORNING TV HAS NO SIGNAL. Unfortunately the customer service is below 4 star. No real service not even 4 star.. Staff standing around talking at restaurant. No greetings and only once person could speak fluent english. I would rate this hotel 4 star at most. More like 3.5 star. The hotel is less then 10-15% full with over 100 plus room. Arrived at 1pm waited till 230pm to check in ..what a joke . You would think the hotel would give free up grade to ocean view but we are on the other side. Lookimg at other rooms The wifi is very slow and weak in our room. How can this be considered 5 star. You book a hotel as believe its 5 star ..ive been to over 100 5 star hotels in my life and is the 3rd hotel which is below 4 star. Im very disappointed as i would consider this hotel 3 star. Run down old hotel. Very disappointing as i only booked this hotel due to being 5 star in rating. Please get thos hotel reinstated with its correct rating. Our conceige informed me have free yoga classes ..its Monday and leave Thursday and no yoga classes to.Friday... please make sure staff are well educated and informed when giving information to guests .. especially concierge as this is there duty. Im writing to.the president of Wyndham Hotels regarding this matter regarding its 5 star rating."
"213.","Tishanda Fleming","8","2023-12-31","2","Where do I begin …. The pools are dirty, I’m afraid to get in, the location is beautiful but far out from civilization, so unless you don’t plan to do activities this wouldn’t matter. The room has potential but it lacks cleanliness, and it’s run down in most areas. The jacuzzi on the balcony is rusted very run down, and you fill it the water runs out, it’s obviously broken, I don’t even want to use it. This was a waste of money for me and my husband. I wish we didn’t book 4 nights here, I am highly disappointed and so upset. The food is pricey for absolutely no reason. DO NOT BOOK THIS PLACE, there is so many other options that is worth it. Some of the staff was very nice though."
"214.","Amelia Wulandari","30","2022-12-31","3","Saya menginap 1 malam di sini. Berikut beberapa hal yang menurut saya bagus dan kurang bagus. Hal bagus : 1. Kamar saya menghadap laut, pemandangan sangat cantik. Saya dapat melihat matahari terbit 2. Arsitektural bagus 3. Kamar sangat luas 4. Saya dapat melihat laut dari sini meskipun pasir pantainya hitam 5. Harga kamar sangat bersahabat. Hal yang kurang bagus : 1. Jacuzzi nya air dingin.! 🙁☹️ 2. Air panas tidak terlalu panas, kalau sudah lama dipakai jadi dingin, jadi jika akan menggunakan air panas lagi harus menunggu. 3. Jacuzzi banyak semut. Terkesan tidak terawat. 🙁☹️ di kamar orangtua saya malah airnya keluar terus tidak bisa dimatikan, sampai memanggil teknisi. Teknisinya info memang bangunan sudah lama jadi memang rusak (seakan kami harus memaklumi?) 4. Kegiatan di hotel sangat minim apalagi untuk ukuran resort. 5. Spot foto tidak sebagus di website 6. Breakfast super standart seperti hotel bintang 3. 7. Ada bar dekat pool tapi tidak ada aktivitas di sana, dan tampaknya tidak digunakan? 8. Air kolam renang hijau (lumut?) seperti kurang terawat."

"217.","Andi Somma","11","2023-12-31","2","I stayed at Wyndham Tamansari Resort with my family (my mother, aunt, my wife, and my 11 month daughter) from 29/09/2023 to 02/10/2023. We booked two rooms (5104 and 5102) with beach front view. Here are some of the highlights and problems that we experienced during our stay: Highlights: - The resort has a very clean and beautiful outdoor area. The beach front view is wonderful and relaxing. - The rooms are large and spacious, with comfortable beds and furniture. The bathrooms are also clean and well-equipped. The resort has a kids friendly pool, which is great for families with children. The pool is also close to the beach, so you can enjoy both the sea and the pool. -The food at the restaurant is delicious and varied. We especially enjoyed the buffet breakfast, which was well prepared and had a lot of options. The staff are friendly and helpful. They always greeted us with a smile and tried to accommodate our requests. Problems: -The resort does not have a valet service, so guests have to park by themselves. This can be inconvenient if you have a lot of luggage or if the parking lot is full. -The check-in time is supposed to be at 02:00 pm, but when we arrived at 04:00 pm, one of our rooms (5102) was not ready. We had to wait for 40 minutes until they cleaned the room. -The minibar in both rooms was empty, which was disappointing. There was no point in having a minibar if there was nothing in it. Room 5102 did not have sandals or bath robes, which are usually provided in other resorts. We had to ask the staff to bring them to us. -Both rooms did not have an information booklet that explains how to use the facilities or services in the resort. For example, we did not know how to use the telephone, the TV, or the Wi-Fi. There was also no paper and pen in case we wanted to write a note. - The resort has a policy to not charge restaurants' bills to our room number, which is absurd because we stayed at the resort. If we were an outsider that i could understand. We had to pay directly after we finished eating or pay after a room service. - The restaurant allows guests to bring plates with food from the buffet breakfast to their rooms. This is very unhygienic and wasteful. It also creates a lot of mess in the corridors and elevators. - We also saw a guest pour soap in the jacuzzi and make a lot of soap bubbles. This is very disrespectful and dangerous. It can damage the jacuzzi and cause skin irritation or infection for other guests. The staff should have stopped this behavior and warned the guest. Overall, we had a mixed experience at Wyndham Tamansari Resort. It has some positive aspects, but also many negative ones that need to be improved. I would NOT recommend this place to someone that I know because I would embaresed my self. We hope that the management will take our feedback seriously and make some changes for the betterment of their service and quality."

Kamar: Saya pesan online Suite King Size, namun saat check in ternyata King Size habis. Akhirnya kasur twin dijadikan 1, tapi hanya 2 kasur yg didempetkan, tidak dikasih alas yg menyatu agar pisahan antar kasur tidak berasa. Malah selimutnya juga terpisah. Baru pertama kali nemu yang begini, apalagi ini hotel 5. Di hotel2 lain, klo king size habis, kasur twin didempetkan jadi 1, tapi tetap dikasih alas menyatu sehingga pisahan antar kasur tidak berasa dan dikasi selimut ukuran king size juga 3. Layanan: saya tanya masalah kasur twin ini kepada pihak hotel dan mereka bilang memang begitu, tidak ada usaha untuk memuaskan konsumennya."

Pas checkin sempat ada kendala tapi dapat diatasi dengan mudah. Kami memesan via trip.com dengan rate kamar sekitar 575rb tanpa breakfast. Kamar kami ada di gedung belakang resepsionis. First impression nyampe di kamar, wah gile cakep banget! Maklum kemarin-kemarin nginep di hotel budget 300-400 udah include breakfast, lalu dapat yang ini jadi kayak 'beda kelas'. Interior design kamar nya dengan nuansa wood+concrete/stone, ditambah lagi semua lampunya warna warm tone bikin kamarnya jadi berasa hangat, tenang dan homey. One thing yang catch my attention pertama kali adalah kamar mandinya yg tembus pandang! LOL tapi itu opsional karena ada gorden yang bisa ditutup. Bathroom amenities juga banyak dan gak biasa kayak sewing kit, shoes mitt, apalah itu. Gak banyak orang yang pakai, tapi ya bagus jika lengkap. Yang kusuka itu mereka punya kamar mandi punya 2 shower head. Satu tanam dan satu lagi gantung. Jujur, aku lebih prefer yang gantung. Karena lebih gampang untuk mandiin anak-anak. So, dengan 2 pilihan gini, enak banget. Yg dewasa mau shower dari atas kepala kayak hujan bisa. Yg anak mau shower dimandiin mamak pun bisa. Semua bisa 👍 Sepertinya ini hotel baru yah jadi semua masih dalam kondisi bagus banget! Love it! Pas nyampe, juga di kasih voucher welcome drink yang bisa ditukar di area beach club. Ohya, disini punya 2 kolam renang. 1 di area beach club yang ada pasirnya. 1 lagi di bagian dalam hotel dengan ukuran lebih kecil. Aku bawa anak-anak main di kolam renang beach club. *PADA SUKA BANGET!!* Main disini bisa habis 2 jam lebih loh kalo ga di paksa stop! Main air iya, main pasir iya. Cuman minusnya karena ada pasir ya jadi kolam renangnya juga ada pasir di area pinggir-pinggir. Recommended? YES!"

Waktu saya nginap di sana lebaran tahun ini, kolam renang sedang dalam maintenance, agak butek. Tamu kebanyakan turis lokal dengan membawa keluarga dan anak-anak ada juga turis asing. Kamar bersih tapi handuknya terlihat kusam (tua) jadi ragu2 pakainya. Jauh dari keramaian jadi cocok utk stay cation. Jauh dari resto dan fasilitas lainnya. Makanan di resto kurang cocok di lidah saya yg suka makanan tradisional Indonesia, harga makanan masih rata2 hotel ***. Saya ke sana dengan ikut promosi keanggotaan hotel tersebut, lama mereka presentasi sekitar 90 menit, harga agak murah sih ikut promosi itu cuma ya harus ikut penawaran2 mereka, mulanya sangat ramah dan hangat pembicaraannya, tapi pas terakhir saya gak mau gabung mereka jadi jutek dan agak gak saya suka cara2 nawarin nya, agak gak sopan kata2 dan tindakanya setelah saya tolak. Saya pikir mending cari alternatif lain drpd sakit ati."

Within 10 minutes for our checked in process plus she explained about the hotel facilities, and she handed over the key. There was a porter who's ready to escort us to the room. Along the way, he also explained where is the way to the pool and the beach club located, which I found it very useful information. They have two swimming pools which both are very relaxing. But my favorite is the one near the beach. The pool is big and with the background of the wave sounds peaceful. Jivva Restaurant looks cute, and the interior is fantastic. The food is delicious and especially the ice cream. They have kind of healthy ice cream. When we checked out at 1 PM, We decided to spend more time by the beach pool and had our lunch again by the pool until the time we need to go to the airport. Our flight was late at night. Around 5 PM, we want to get ready to the airport, the reception allowing us to have a shower and changing room in the spa room. The spa room is accommodating for us.

Bangunan ada beberapa building, masing2 empat lantai, masing2 ada lift dan dikelilingi taman dan ada juga kolam renang. Secara keseluruhan terlihat masih terawat meski ada beberapa yg perlu diperbaiki. Receptionist terletak didepan dengan bangunan yg unik, dilayani banyak petugas sehingga cepat. Setiap bangunan ada ram khusus kursi roda, sehingga buat org tua gak ada kendala. Ruang kamar terbilang luas (ada di foto) utk kamar Deluxe king dgn balkon. Ada bath tub Restoean sangat excotic, dipinggir pantai dengan suara ombak. Memu breakfast enak, meski variasi gak banyak2 amat. Ada bubur, counter telur, roti, main course, buah dan minuman. Saran/minus nya adalah area parkir yg terbatas sehingga kadang kami disuruh parkir diluar area hotel, sekitar 300m. Beberapa pelayanan restoran saat kami nginap masih lamban dan kelihatan kikuk.. dimaklumi krn efek shock pandemi. Overall sangat baik. Sesuai dgn price, lokasi, dan fasilitasnya.."

There are tourist attractions in the area, but not in walking distance, and no public transportation around, so plan accordingly."

"255.","Lộc lê","64","2023-12-31","4","Resort next to black sand beach. The view is beautiful and service is good. It’s not really 5 star resort, I rate it 3 star, maybe 4 star at most. Many things are broken or too old in the garden, swimming pool and restaurant. There is nothing to do, visit and no international restaurant, coffee shop within 5km. Food at restaurant was dry and not really good. Consider this resort when you really want to stay away the crowd and anh traffic noice. You can see lots of stars at night here because the resort is kind of isolated from all other things."

Padahal saya sudah bilang berulang kali kemungkinan koper saya di taruh dalam kamar kosong tapi sepertinya suara saya di anggap angin lalu dan tidak serius dalam mencari koper saya. Masak iya yang katanya hotel bintang 5 tidak TAU kamar mana saja yang berpenghuni sama tidak karyawannya ngapain aja???? Yang seharusnya malam itu saya bisa istirahat dan ganti pakaian jadi memikirkan besok mau ganti baju apa kalau sampe kopernya tidak ketemu. 😏 Mana karyawan tidak mau di salahkan dan malah menyalahkan saya yang jelas-jelas jadi korban (playing victim kebangetan). Minta tolong perbaiki SDM nya minimal bisa mengaku salah kalau memang salah. Terimakasih"

You can walk to the beach near the hotel or ride a bicycle to enjoy the pristine paddy field. The staff are friendly and the rooms are so comfortable and spacious. However, the food is not extraordinary. Overall it is a recommended place to spend holidays with your family and friends."
"261.","Rosco Andrew","124","2023-12-31","1","STAY ELSEWHERE... PLEASE When you are promised a higher end stay with new and clean and you are sorely disappointed. Yes, the staff are polite, but it is surface only. Reception was disorganized and untidy and I could see other travelers having check in issues. The buildings and infrastructure is old and dangerously dated, with facades falling or peeling off, wires exposed and holes in the walls that need repair. Rusty high riser water pipes for fire systems, they would not hold with pressure going through them. THE FIRST ROOM WAS FILTHY, you are greeted with a black mold smell the minute you walk in and it doesn't go away. Long black hairs left in the sink, the shower and main area, then to the bed, fresh blood spots (10mm and bigger) on the cover and sheets, make-up or poo/sex stain as well. GROSS and further to top it off, the fridge wasn't working, light go, no cool. Rung reception, get hung up on after the first conversation. Keep ringing back, guess caller ID has it's advantages for them, we ended up going down to reception again to get a new fridge and or a cleaner room. I will not be shrugged off at any reception, anywhere in the world, having owned a small resort, I know how hard it is to work with guests, so if you do stay here (DON'T!!!) and have issues please stand at reception until the manager is finally roused out of their slumber to deal with the issue. I very nearly brought the fridge down to make my point!!! I hope the solo traveler that was also having issues got her jacuzzi room as promised, because the shrugs at the reception were pissing her off too! Our room issue was finally sort of resolved by a cleaner room, but border line. The place needs a refit or it will slide into a slum palace. The company claims to be environmentally friendly... however from the balcony I can see an old, part opened drum (40litre) of chlorine rusting away in the undergrowth, with the HAZNO sign still clearly visible, the toxic to sea life one. Maybe if they used it in the pool and balcony pools they wouldn't be that sickly green and cloudy water that you just DON'T want to dip your toes in. Plus the rubbish is just chucked over the magic fence at the resort, and it's clearly resort rubbish, I found an old fluro light fitting (the whole thing) and broken light switches. REALLY??? The dining area, watch your footing, the decking is failing as is the food. Marginally better than army bung-hole. But plenty of fresh fruit, stick with that. To qualify myself for giving such a poor review and actually being able to back it up. I've owned and run my own small resort and work on the maintenance team a five star true luxury lodge in NZ. Also I am Kiwi. Reading other reviews, it looks a lot like this resort is paying some travelers to write great reviews. Yes, this review is long and thank you for reading it, I am not a precious traveler (neither is my wife) but this place does not deserve your hard earned money and holiday time. Find better. PLEASE"

There are mosquitos in the room. At third day, the hot water is off, and the worst part is the water is suddendly off!! What the hell!! The bathub also is broken. I cannot enjoy the bathub perfectly. Breakfast is dissapointing for five star hotel. The taste is so so, menu choice is also not much. My friend said the food was 'busuk'. Will never stay at here again"
"271.","Shinta Wardhani","351","2022-12-31","5","An 1 hour driving from Denpasar, it's one of the best option for family getaway. Surrounded by beaches on their backside and paddy field on the other side, it offers a complete facilities in a serene nuance. They had conducted lots of maintenance when I came there at early July 22, which is a sign of reopening normally after pandemic. The room is tidy and well-designed. Breakfast is not so vary but great. Their resto is located in front of the beach, so you can bring your food to the couch and bean bag to enjoy the ocean breeze. Swimming pool is surrounded by white-sands playing area and having lots of step on the pool's edge which are enjoyable and safe both for adults and children. Be cautious from the beach due to its strong streams and waves. Best time for a beach walk is 6-7am as you can catch a mesmerizing sunrise. If you're lucky enough, you also can see dolphins playing around as I did. Lovely ❤"

"273.","Novitasari SpPA","70","2022-12-31","1","Very bad experience stay, below my expectation. Sy stay tgl 22-23 Maret 2022 memakai 2 voucher dari travel**a (yg ternyata pihak trv mengambil dari pihak lain, yaitu MG). Voucher tsb atas nama teman saya dari Jakarta yg batal ke Bali shg dihibahkan ke sy. 1. Check in paling aneh bin ribet yg pernah sy alami. Sy tunjukkan evoucher dan KTP teman sy. Ditolak. Diminta suruh bikin surat pernyataan tertulis dari teman sy yg menyatakan bahwa sy diberi hak utk memakai voucher. Alasannya: takut ntar ada yg check in lg pake voucher tsb. Sudah kubilang, sy bersedian guarantee dng cc sy, silahkan diopen. Klo ada org lain check in, sy bersedia bayar. Tetap tidak mau dan tetap diminta surat pernyataan. 2. Sy stay 1 dewasa dengan 3 anak umur 11, 9, dan 3th. Voucher sy ada 2 lho, 2 kamar. Sy diminta membayar extra person 350rb perorang x2 menjadi 700rb. Krn di voucher tertulisnya 1 kamar 1 adult. Sy bilang: 2 anak kan seharga 1 dws. Harusnya bisa 1 room, trus yg 3th harusnya free. Tapi petugas FO nama Ratna dan staf reservasi nama Adit tetap ngotot tidak bisa. Pilihannya sy harus booking 4 kamar (@1 orang) atau 2 kamar +700rb. Gila bener. Peraturan kaku macam apa lah itu. Kata si Adit: email yg kami terima seperti itu. Kujawab: tapi hotel kan ya punya kebijaksanaan sendiri ya, masak iya anak umur 3th di kamar sendiri. Seperti aturan breakfast ada hotel yg free dibawah 3th, ada yg 6th… itu kan kebijakan hotel bukan kebijakan yg diatur oleh pihak travel. Di FO sudah kena 2 masalah itu, udah niat banget sy cancel check in dan pulang aja. Ternyata ada orang baik yg memberikan 1 room lagi kepada sy sehingga akhirnya sy dpt 3 kamar dan kata si adit dikasi free utk yg bungsu umur 3th itu. Pengalaman paling menggelikan, menjengkelkan, bikin super emosi….peraturan kaku dan kesannya mengada2. Masuk kamar. Kebersihan 75%. Debu di area meja minibar dan kamar mandi, kesan lama gak dimasukin orang. AC gak dingin. Air kamar mandi lama panasnya. Channel TV cuma 10 aja dan membosankan. Kolam renang dng kebersihan 75%, ada daun2, sayap burung, jentik nyamuk. Sy lihat ada papan notif yg menuliskan harga paket day pass 25rb perorang sudah dapat 1 french fries, 1 es teh dan bisa berenang sepuasnya. Dalam hati, lumayan murah. Saat mau order, lha kok french fries harga 35rb, nasgor 80rb. Kutanyakanlah… yg sana 25rb udah french fries+teh, kok ini french fries aja 35. Kata stafnya: iya itu harga paket, klo yg ini harga ala carte. Terus terang sy gak mudeng. Overall, gak bakal balik lagi disini. Klo ada yang sedang mempertimbangkan untuk stay disini, perhatikan baik2 ya, banyak jebakan betmen nya, peraturan kaku dan mengada-ngada."

"276.","Stian Jonassen","161","2023-12-31","3","I managed to book this place for 2 weeks, without reading enough of reviews 😅🤣 But it turned out great. Keep in mind. You'll need a driver if you want to go somewhere. The hotel offers free driving to Ubud in the morning and pickup in the afternoon. In general it's a very chill atmosphere right by the beach. Unfortunately the beach is not for swimming. We relaxed a lot during our stay. The room was very big. And the bed was large and comfy. The guy that helped us with the luggage is very nice and speaks good English. His name is Surya. Treat him good until he leaves for Canada in the end of August. Unfortunately the Hotel needs some maintenance. There's potential for a great Hotel, but it'll take time. I think COVID hit them hard, as everyone in Bali felt. During our stay we ate a lot at the restaurant. I almost went through the menu 🤣🤣 Reasonable prices. After all, you're in a hotel. I hope you'll meet Ayo that works in the restaurant. She's so nice, and speaks very good English. We would definitely stay here again. We had a great stay in general. We combined our stay with 3 nights in Gili Trawangan and a daytrip to Nusa Penida."
"277.","Chiara Wehinger","263","2023-12-31","3","The location is lovely, it's very green and quiet. Perfect for relaxing for a few days. But there is a lot of room for improvement, first the internet is so slow. I had to do one videocall for uni and it was nearly impossible. Also normal internet-use was hard as it fluctuated quiet a bit. A stable and reliable internet connection is a must and it certainly did not deliver. Also the gym needs more care. The equipment, is old, which is ok imo but it doesn't even look like it's cleaned a lot. There was also no treadmill. The staff is very attentive and friendly. They also have vegan options on their menu. Did not expect to find a vegan pizza and pasta on it. The rooms are ok, but the walls are very thin. So you hear everything. Two things that really annoyed me where that the AC was fluctuating a lot, so during the night we had intervalls of intense sweating then too cold. Not the best tbh. And the locks on the doors made this really annoying sound, that sounded like an alarm clock. They do have a beautiful yoga shala, which was wonderful to flow in."

The check-in experience was okay, but the receptionist didn't communicate very well and forgot to give us the room key. When we arrived to the room, one of the room keys was not working and we had to wait for the bellboy to go back to the receptionist to fix it. The New Year's Eve celebration at the hotel was okay, but the band and DJ were not particularly great. The breakfast was so-so. The main issue we had with the hotel was that it was quite old and not well-maintained. The gym equipment was rusty and appeared not to be in good working condition. Overall, we had an okay experience, but I would not recommend this hotel due to its age and lack of maintenance"

"284.","Kseniya Lotkova","16","2023-12-31","3","We chose this hotel for a weekend vacation with a child by the ocean. I will write about the shortcomings in the hope that the hotel will improve. 1. We booked a hotel on booking, check-in at 14.00, the room was not ready. 2. The room is paid for as for 3 adults. The room has 2 single beds, the sofa is not covered. How should a family with a child sleep? There is nothing for 3 persons, it is designed for two. 3. The bathtub on the balcony is dirty with mold, the railing is covered with paint after construction. 4. A very modest children's room where no one goes, there is no playground on the street. 5. The restaurant has tiny desserts for a high price. Children's food is served with spicy sauce. Tom yum soup is expensive and it's just water with tomatoes, many dishes are not finalized. 6. The cost of a massage is 3 times more expensive than in Ubud. Maybe that's why no one is there? 7. the beach is dirty, full of rubbish. why can't it be removed? Do you have a view of the ocean from the hotel? in the evening people sit, admire the sunset and garbage. From the pleasant, this is a large territory and you can take a walk, delicious Nasi Goreng, a varied and tasty breakfast, 2 swimming pools, polite staff, large room size, nice design, good gym, nice music playing at the restaurant."

There are a little bit problems with communication since not all of the staff speaks fluent english. I don’t really care about this. The main problem I have until now is they have not give my refund money. So we stayed until in the August 16th. During our stay, I upgraded the room and paid it up front since they said I have to paid all payment up front. But 2 or 3 days staying in that room made me sick with all of the problems such as a bad poop smells in front and in the back area of the room, not enough sun light in the room that made our room humid and smells like mold. So we had to downgraded the room. They said they will refund my money for the rest of the day of that upgraded fee. They said it will takes up to 30 days. They sent me the refund invoice but until this day, I have not received any refund yet. In August I spoke to one of their marketing staff through WhatsApp and she told me that someone named Alvin will reach out to me to discuss about this refund but I didn’t receive any email, chat or phone call from anyone up until now. At this point, this is a fraud. They have not give my money back which is a total of $459.66. Be careful with this Hotel guys!!!"

Resort bar ran out of vodka, I mean really it's only about 30 % capacity ? Reception staffed by 3 people 2 of them just direct you to the only one who apparently can do anything so be prepared to wait. Beach is black sand but there are no feet washing facilities, note you can not swim at the beach as shore dumping waves all day all night. Absolutely nothing close by so if isolation is your thing then this is the place for you. 1 restaurant food is good and at least the reasturant staff are fantastic but I would hate to try and get a seat if this place was at capacity. Look around there are So many better resorts to choose from in Bali."

Beside that, the room is great value, clean, and there is nice beach and nice view. O yea, also this hotel is far from anywhere, just to get to ubud, need 1 hour by car."
"305.","Kaweri Lestari","62","2020-12-31","5","3 nights stay yang mengesankan. Penerapan protocol kesehatan juga baik, disediakan 1 ruangan khusus / lounge untuk tempat transit atau karantina sementara bagi tamu yang datang dengan suhu tubuh di atas 37,5' C. Saya pesan 2 kamar berdekatan dan disediakan kamar yang berhadapan di ujung balkon lantai 3 yang memiliki pemandangan sawah. Salah satu kamar menghadap laut dan kamar seberangnya memiliki pemandangan kebun. Main pool yang dilengkapi dengan bar kecil dan pemandangan pantai yang indah. Restoran ada 2, satu restoran dekat lobby difungsikan untuk breakfast dan restoran lainnya dekat main pool dengan taman yang luas dan menghadap pantai. Menyediakan fasilitas gym dan balai untuk senam yoga. Ruang spa yang unik berupa bangunan kecil semacam bungalow. Staff ramah, pilihan breakfast variatif. Pemandangan indah yang dapat dijadikan spot foto beragam, mulai dari sawah, kebun, rawa, pantai dan laut. Nice stay ever.."

Amenities dan fasilitas kamar yang lengkap menjadi proof kalau hotel ini sudah mengusung standar bintang 5. Yang paling luar biasa berkesan adalah their staff really superkind! Will be back soon someday, thank you!"

The food was incredibly good and I believe that everyone who stays in this resort will gain an experience of being a king or queen in a tropical island since the staffs are really kind."
"310.","Kat Agres","22","2022-12-31","1","This is the poorest excuse for a 5-star hotel I’ve ever seen. Should be 2-stars. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a more disorganised hotel or worse customer service. Absolutely terrible communication, and very little ability to speak English. The first warning sign was at check-in. We arrived right at 2pm for check-in, and we were the first ones in the lobby, but it still took them 25 minutes to check us in. No idea what took so long. The first room they showed us was totally infested with mosquitoes - there were dozens! - so their solution was to spray bug spray everywhere (over our towels, belongings, etc)… I felt nauseous for the next several hours after the fumes. After spraying the bathroom, 6 mosquitoes dropped dead into the bathtub alone (see photo). Finally I had to go to the lobby to request a new room, at which point they told us they had none, but when I asked about the room next door they said, oh yeah, it will be ready in two hours. It wasn’t. It took 5 hours, and no one dropped off keycards so we could enter (as we requested, twice). There were many safety hazards, inconveniences, violations of privacy, and terrible communication; I will list the main points below: - Communication was abysmal: hardly anyone speaks English, so calling to request anything from the room was nearly impossible. E.g., after calling twice to request a blanket and being promised one, they never delivered it. - LACK OF PRIVACY: There was construction with scaffolding and men working outside our windows every day! Good grief. No privacy in our rooms during the day for this reason (See photo) - Spider webs around mirror in bathroom and next to the toiletries they left us - The safe in our room didn’t work and the mini fridge was broken - They gave us one large towel and no hand towels for a twin room with two adults (never did get any hand towels). Large towels were old, had sizable holes (see pic), and smelled heavily of smoke. - Advertised as a beach report, but there is no swimming at the beach due to high waves, and apparently the water is not clean due to runoff from nearby farms - The pool water was murky and green! I couldn’t even see the bottom of the pool, so wouldn’t let my toddler swim in it. Disgusting. We paid (twice) to go to a nearby resort to swim in a normal pool. See photo of pool water - There were stray dogs itching their fleas and following us around at breakfast - Slow service: We left for a day tour around 8:30am, and upon returning 7 hours later, there were only just beginning to make up one of our rooms (the other not made up)… interfered with our toddler being able to take a nap! Then 10 minutes after we entered our room (we had to wait until they made up the room), three maintenance workers knocked on our door because they needed to fix the foot pool at the end of our room :( - The foot pool was also murky and had many dead insects and plants floating on top. As fun as it sounded to have, we didn’t use it once (looked disgusting). - LOUD: There was loud music and a man speaking loudly/yelling on a megaphone on the beach with a group of people at 7am… we heard it (and it woke us up) all the way at the end of the building on the second to top floor. It was really loud, and they did this for over an hour. 🤦‍♀️ - SAFETY HAZARDS: Part of the ceiling fell down right next to our room. See photo. Also, the structural integrity of the building was questionable - the room shook a lot with every wave. Actually, the whole *building* shook with every big wave - it was enough to wake us up a few times during the night. - They “lost” our $100 deposit 3 times (a total ordeal to get them to “find” the deposit in their system each time) And I could go on! Again, just terrible service. Not a 5-star hotel, not even close! (Aren’t there authorities who check this sort of thing? I honestly can’t believe the star rating.) Bottom line: DON'T STAY AT THIS HOTEL. It's not safe, has terrible service, and is lacking in basic amenities."

"313.","marc tytsma","3","2023-12-31","2","My wife and I recently stayed here for 6 nights as we have wyndham ownership and the only other resort was closed due to whatever reason. How this resort is 5 star is beyond me. In my personal opinion I would struggle to give this resort 2 stars! Immediately you could see that that the resort was built with poor building materials! Our 2nd key card would not work and was replaced and opened the door once then did not work again. The doors on one of the cabinets would not close properly. Our room was just a standard type hotel room ( nothing special and definitely nothing 5 star about it!) The balcony sliders looked like they would fall off if you tried to use them. It is about a 1 hour 15 min drive from denpasar airport. The wooden decking around the pools are made with untreated wood and are very unsafe. In some parts it felt like you could fall through if too much weight would be applied. If you are wanting to do the tourist shopping for clothes , shoes , watches etc then this is not the place for you. However if you are wanting to experience less hussle and bussel and enjoy the beautiful scenery and rural activities close by then it is a great location. All of the staff were %110 beautiful and helpful but many of them let us down with the poor English. ( which in a 5 star resort you should expect better! ) For a 5 star resort the staff had poor uniforms that did not match. Wearing any shoes they like and different shirts etc. Breakfast buffet was okay for the price. Food and drink was on the more expensive side.They have no shuttle for guests to go anywhere ( also very poor I feel for a 5 star resort)Overall Looking at the state of the resort now I would be very surprised if this resort was still operating in 3-5 years time. I give a 2 star rating only because of how lovely all the staff were ( even if most of them couldn't speak English) and our driver who picked us up from the airport ( A local who was sub contracted by the resort) was awesome ( we ended up booking him the next day to take us around for the day ) after realising there was no courtesy shuttle to take guests anywhere. Unfortunately for these reasons and there are some more I could explain ( but I don't have the time atm ) we won't be going back."

Sudah bayarnya mahal tp kok seperti ini ya pelayanannya. Kita kesini dr review youtube dan harga promo dari 1,2 jd 950 per malam dan kita menginap 2 malam. Dan pas kita booking kelebihan 50rb aja ga dikembalikan katanya deposit restoran. Gmn mau milih lagi klo semua makanan spt ini😪😪😪"

Booking photos was promissing, room look modern and clean. But when we arrived we can see that this hotel need a deep clean and renovation. In our first room, there was crack on some of the floor tiles. The ac not working. The bathroom door jammed. We asked to move to another room. It was a tad bit better. We went to sleep since its already late. But then in the morning we just realize. The outdoor jaccuzi was moldy. The balcony lounge full of ants and dirty. The bathtub plug not working. And there was some white powdery residue (maybe from the air freshner). Both pools at the hotel looks murky. The elevator was dark, dirty and worn out. Breakfast was so so."
"318.","Josh Naylor","3","2023-12-31","1","Night 1, treated by reception as criminals taking pictures and making us sign documents, which other guests didn't have to do, felt uneasy from the start, We then went to our rooms and was tired from our journey so wanted to watch TV inbed, no way of connecting phone or Netflix to TV have to watch normal TV channels do not recommend, Sea view King suite, very close to the ocean, hear waves and Loud crashing all night can't sleep when a big wave comes the whole room and bed shakes, we were on the top floor, this wasn't good during the night as you would wake up thinking it was an earthquake, also on the first night we had 5 power outages so was sat in the hotel room in darkness, no torches 0r anything supplied. Was supposed to stay for 7 nights we stayed for 3 as there is also stray dogs walking around the hotel grounds and the restaurant during the night they would fight, howl and cry for 20 minute periods of time, which would wake everybody up, these animals also go in the pools after hours. The hotel looks good but when you look closer you can see that it is falling to bits, This hotel is a massive disappointment to the wyhndam franchise and I do not recommend this to anybody who wants to be on holiday to relax and wind down as the whole time we felt anxious and on edge. Very disappointing holiday"

Saat saya menginap disini ombaknya sedang besar. Suara gemuruh ombak terdengar dari lobi namun tidak terdengar dari kamar. Security berjaga dengan ketat untuk mengawasi tamu hotel agar tidak bermain di pantai. Pantai Lepang ini berpasir hitam. Tampak Nusa Penida dari kejauhan. Awalnya saya takut melihat ombak yang begitu besar namun lama kelamaan terbiasa. Area hotel terasa sangat asri. Ada 2 kolam renang. 1 di dekat pantai. 1 di tengah2 resort. Lebih kecil namun lebih tenang. Kamar cukup bersih dan nyaman. Pelayanan staff juga baik. Untuk makan memang disarankan di area hotel sebab cukup jauh dari rumah makan atau restoran terdekat. Breakfast disini tidak terlalu banyak pilihan. Untuk jenis kamar terbaik mungkin kamar di dekat kolam renang utama yg menghadap ke pantai dengan plunge pool."

It can be seen from the number of areas that are not operating, even when in the room, we have to repeatedly call room service to make repairs to the water heating system. some of the lights and the lift were also turned off. Despite these few issues, the hotel basically offers a pleasant stay. we can hear the waves, great beach club, and lovely room."

Kolam renang berada dipinggir laut, pemandangan sangat bagus, hanya saja krn kolam renang tercampur pasir sehingga agak butek. Untuk makanan breakfast juga perlu perhatian lebih, rasanya masih kurang utk ukuran hotel bintang 5. Disekitar hotel juga sangat jarang restoran, jadi mungkin bawa bekal cemilan atau makanan instant untuk dikamar."

"349.","Putri","25","2022-12-31","1","We staying 5 nights during lebaran holiday. DISSAPOINTMENT doesn't begin to describe our experience. From the moment we tried to check in, they didn't even recognise our booking from Agoda. We come for breakfast at 8am-9am and always finding food finish and they never topped up!! And when you want to relax at the pool, they ALWAYS run out of TOWELS!! (And this is at 3pm-4pm) All the waitress and service people seems to be inexperienced. You ask them something, they don't have an answer. Rooms wont be cleaned daily unless you call the reception and ask for cleaning. And when they clean the room they only do your beds they dont top up the bath essentials or wiped anything. For $125 a night, its not worth your money at all. Ohh and if you are still working during your holiday, goodluck opening any files or website with their WIFI!! Worse connection ever! We had to use our data. TV is very basic, only local channels, which I didnt really care coz we watch Disney or Netflix, but due to the really bad wifi, we cant watch them either!! 🤣🤣🤣 The only thing good I can say is that we chose the bigger room of the Ocean Front. You get the view of the ocean really well and hear the sounds of the waves non stop. But is it worth all that trouble and constant dissapoinment?? We haven't check out at the moment, we've only survived our 3rd night, 2night to go. I just hope checking out wont be a nightmare. Will let you guys know the rest of the review after check out."

Di saat pemerintah menyerukan rajin cuci tangan supaya terhindar dari covid,hotel ini malah tidak memberikan sabun cuci tangan. Telpon di kamar pun mati. Jd saya harus jalan ke resepsionis di depan utk minta sabun cuci tangan. Org nginep di hotel biar nyaman dan gak ribet. Nginep di sini malah jd emosi dengan servicenya.

"355.","Advantours","343","2020-12-31","4","Staying there for a wedding, it was a bit chaotic during the check in coz many rooms weren't available during the check in time. The receptionists were under a lot of pressure coz the waiting guests weren't happy by having to wait in an open air lobby and not enough seats. Regardless the check in incident, overall the place deserves a 5 star rating. The food for the party was incredibly tasty, also the buffet breakfast was excellent. The suite room is spacious with a jacuzzi on the balcony over looking the ocean. Another minor is the monopoly for transportation, online taxi isn't allowed to pick the guests up from the resort. It's a real hassle as the place is off the main street and out of the busy area. It's just ridiculous for paying a few millions for the room then still forced to use their transportation service."

I had a problem logging in to Wifi and the staff was very helpful & warm to me throughout. The breakfast spread is quite varied & foods were generally tasty. The crowd was a bit too 'local' I feel, i.e. there was a fully clothed headdressed woman plunging in the pool, and I kept getting stared at by families passing by while suntanning by the pool by myself. Thankfully black-sanded Lepang Beach right by the hotel was completely empty during the day so hanging out on the beach & inside the comfort of my room were the two highlights of my stay here."

Seperti gagang pintu yang agak rusak, marmer kamar mandi yg tidak terpoles, suasana malam yang agak spooky karena banyak kamar belum terisi. Yah apa boleh buat. Untungnya liburan kali ini rame2 sama temen2 jadi secara pribadi gak terlalu meresahkan. Tapi anyway tetep enjoy"
"366.","Azvin Lazuardy","209","2017-12-31","3","Five star resort with not so much five star service. I had to unload the luggage myself. The guy at front desk just watch me doing it. It's in the middle of nowhere. It's one hour from anywhere in Bali. They don't even allow online taxi so you have to use local (expensive) taxi. The nearest proper beach (the one you could swim, can't swim at hotels beach since the current is too strong) is at least 45 minutes away. Got bored on the second day because there was nothing to do. TV only got 40 channels, even budget hotel got more than that. The room's pool (I book suite pool) is very cold. Water heater didn't work properly in first day. It turns out the temperature set at 40 C and It does not even fill the bath tub. On contrary, I appreciate rooms quality. They use real wood and good furniture. If you decide to stay here, make sure you rent a car, bought some supplies (like snacks, instant coffee, bottled water), and laptop loaded with movies."

Restaurant staff named Awi (ayi)?, unsure, did not behave like a waiter in a 5 star hotel restaurant, when informed that the chili sauce ran out, he only said to inform the staff who was cooking omelete, what the hell? For food. Only the omelette and sausage were good, everything else was just okay and even less so. Rainy conditions. Umbrellas are centralized in the restaurant, most of us were rained on the way to the restaurant, not to mention umbrellas were limited so many people with their families had to go through the rain without umbrellas. For a 5 star hotel, this is poor, please dont expect more"

I'll definitely come back for another stay here. maybe higher floor."

"381.","Eric Tangkilisan","40","2022-12-31","1","I was arrived around 23:00 to check in and just knowing that the parking lot is around 200-300 meters away from the Hotel & there is no valet available. So I have to park my rent car by myself, and right after I parked, huge rain coming and I soaked wet when arrived at lobby. My wife need to complain before they after me with umbrella(but I didnt get the umbrella though). After I complain to the Manager, I get into the suite I’ve ordered, its a Suite Garden View because the Ocean View is fully booked. When my wife fill up the bathtub, we realized that the hot water isnt available, so we need to complain (again), by the way, the sleeper is availble only on request, so we need to request it. The engineer comes and explain that the hot water machine is 1:1 for every room, and the tube is not so huge, so when we use it too much, its need around half hour to heat the water back. Doest make sense for me, since my water heater at home is not that odd. But I try to accept it and use the kettle to add more hot water. And then, there’s this weird “beep” sound randomly comes from the roof of the bathroom. And after my wife finished using bathroom, I need to complain (Again and again). The engineer comes, bring the stair and check on the ceiling. He said that the hot water machine is broken and they need to change the module. 🤦‍♂️ So after I get soaked wet by huge rain, I have to take bath with cold water. Isn’t it a great night for holiday..?! We get fever shortly after take the bath and luckily I bring paracetamols with me. The day after, the manager offer us a “temporary” room for us to use while the engineer fix our hot water. I didnt think thats a good idea so they need to comes with another solution. They offer me the villa but we don’t like the room and the view. After checking, the manager finally comes with the Ocean Front Suite as replacement room. I checked it and find it better than our last suite, so we decided to accept it. The view was amazing, but to be honest, the management is awfully bad. The breakfast is a mess, I come to the restaurant and found that 50% of the breakfast buffet menu is run out. The cutlery arent availble and we need to request and wait after took the food. The worst thing is, marketing person which I contacted to book the room, didnt reply my last complain on text message. Surely I won’t back to Wyndham Tamansari Jivva again. Maybe if they changed the management and the review getting better, will see."

But I don't know if it just me or not, I felt when it gets the high tide and the seawaves that crashing with the sea wall near the hotel make the building swaying around and it felt like a low wave tremor earthquake, need to get the civil engineer to check building integrity and the base foundation of the building after such event, I stay 6 days, and I felt it from the first night of stay till last day of staying in the hotel, but overall it's very great to have a chance to stay in Wyndham Tamansari.

The room was awesome, clean, quite and comfort. We had free welcome drinks at the beach club, facing the ocean. Should improve their wi-fi connection.

Fredy and the resort staff were outstanding in their service, making the stay one to remember. Located just over an hour from the airport in a quite coastal region, it’s a great spot to get away from the city life to relax and recharge. As well to explore the central Bali tourist attractions (besikh temple, kintamani, penglipuran, ubud rice fields, Bali zoo/safari).

This property is actually a decent accomodation and F&B on the Klungkung area. They should dominate the market but unfortunately not. I think if they were taping more on a broader nice market with a certain pricing strategy, they should dominate the market.

Kulkas di kamar mati 3. Staf housekeeping tidak ramah. Saat jadwal pembersihan pagi bertemu tamu malah cekikikan dan bercanda, tidak ada manner, keluar kata2 monyet saat bercanda padahal itu 2 orang wanita dan posisi depan sy sebagai tamu. What do you even think seriously?pertama kali banget ke hotel bintang 5 kaya ke pasar, ga ada attitude. 4. Kolam renang tidak terawat, bisa2nya bagian keramik banyak yang patah2 padahal itu kolam anak, rentan sekali kena kaki anak2 memang ga diperhatikan. Pembatas kolam tidak jelas harusnya ada pembatas sehingga anak2 ga ke area dalam hanya tangga yang kalau kita berenang tidak terasa. 5. Makanan tidak variatif seperti bintang 5, indomie asin kebanyakan air, mie tidak matang, omelette jadi telur dadar, aneh sekali standardnya. Minim makanan. Staf kurang cekatan banyak melamun dan diam. 6. Tidak ada fasilitas lain padahal sangat berharap dengan harga yang lumayan merogoh kocek tapi jujur sangat mengecewakan."
"426.","Muhammad Massardi","17","2026-01-07","1","- Istirahat di kamar berasa simulasi gempa tiap ada ombak, bergetar seruangan - Katanya bintang 5 tapi pilihan menu di resto sedikit, masih lebih variatif yang kelas di bawahnya - Booking sudah jauh² hari dan minta early check in terkonfirmasi bisa oleh marketing atas nama w, saat hari H hanya beberapa kamar saja yang ready. Jadi semrawut juga itinerary - Gala dinner deal di garden dengan opsi resto jika cuaca tidak mendukung, saat hari H lagi dan lagi marketing w terkesan memaksakan untuk memindahkan ke hall. Alasannya sih biar kami lebih nyaman karena cuaca tidak mendukung, pas saya liat malam itu ternyata resto rame tamu jadi cuaca tidak menjadi masalah dong harusnya. Buat apa ngadain gala dinner di sana kalo yang diliat masih tembok. Untuk yang mau mengadakan gala dinner dipikir ulang deh karena di sini kayak memang nggak siap untuk acara seperti ini. Saya juga pernah handle kegiatan gala dinner di hotel 🌟5 di Banyuwangi dan mereka sudah ready dengan pricelist dan penawarannya, beda dengan di sini marketing w malah menanyakan budget kami dan itu berulang kali. Apa susahnya share pricelist dan penawarannya, kalo memang nggak siap jangan dipaksakan."

Resepsionis di FO juga sangat lambat melayani tamu dan menyalahkan sistem mereka. setelah menunggu 1,5 jam, kami berhasil check in tapi menemukan masalah baru lagi yaitu KULKAS RUSAK/MATI. saya menelepon operator dan baru dilakukan penggantian 2 jam setelah saya memberitahu mereka. menu sarapan di hotel juga sedikit dan B saja. tidak seperti hotel lain yang lebih banyak dan bervariasi. jacuzzi/bathtub di balkon kamar juga rusak dan tidak bisa digunakan.

Saya sebagai owner dijanjikan pembaruan point pada tanggal 1 juni 2025. Namun nyatanya point tidak masuk ke akun condotel saya sampai tanggal 2. Tidak ada komunikasi, tidak ada notifikasi. Nomor tenant relation tidak aktif karena alasan bukan jam kerja. Untungnya saya ditolong pihak jivva yang inisiatif mengalokasikan booking saya ke tanggal yang tersedia. Pihak tamansari GAGAL berkomunikasi dengan saya kalau ada kerusakan sistem yang menyebabkan ketidaktersediaan poin. Dan saya sebagai owner sangat rugi waktu, materi, dan emosional. Ketika mereka merespon pun responnya telat, lama, dan template. Di luar itu pengelolaan building di jivva juga BURUK. Saya yang punya properti lain dari tamansari sejujurnya sudah tidak asing dan kaget lagi dengan kelakuan mereka. Kerusakan di mana2, maintenance gak kelar2, you name it. Kulkas di kamar saya bukannya dingin malah panas. Mini barnya juga kalah sama hotel murah di Bali😂😂😂 yang bener aja resort bintang 5 kopi di mini barnya cuma nescafe yang sesachetnya ga sampe dua ribuan? Bahkan ga ada pemanis non gula kayak stevia atau tropicana. Ga ada sendok teh ready di kamar juga, cuma ada stirring rod yang lebih cocok buat jus. Also no hand towels... really? Untungnya staff2 di JIVVA ramah, professional, dan cepat tanggap. Lumayan jadi point plus di tengah keminusan. Sayang sebenernya karena tempat jni punya potensi buat menarik turis tapi pengelolaannya ampas."

Yg ke video cuma 1. Sekelas hotel bintang 5 kok ya pelihara anak kecoa wkwkwk. Telpon room service nunggu sekitar 10mnt datang buat nyariin anak kecoa lainnya. Lgsg dicek seluruh kamar. Besok pagi nya house keeping minta maaf dan akan mencari dan bersihkan menyeluruh kamar (semprot2 atau apalah itu) agar kecoa gak muncul lg. Total ada 5 anak kecoa (mungkin nyariin ibunya, yg jelas bukan saya). Kecewa sekali krn pihak manajemen tidak turun tangan dgn memberi kompensasi pindah kamar. Harusnya service hotel bintang 5 inisitiatif gitu dong kalo customer udah ngalamin hal gak enak bgini. Masa iya harus diminta sama customer nya dulu sambil marah2 (which is menguras tenaga). 2. Menu sarapan utk kelas hotel bintang 5 tidak variatif. Menu buffet standar dan hambar. Buah2an hanya 2 tmpt. Egg dan noodle corner. Sereal susu dan 2 jus. Roti dan kue jg sedikit. 3. Kalo mau cari makan diluar lumayan jauh dr jangkauan. Kalo beli di resto nya pun mahal bgt dan tidak variatif. Rasanya udah kebayang sih dr menu sarapan nya. 4. Lg renovasi mungkin ya jadi murah harga nya tp fasilitas tdk maksimal. Lainkali saya akan lbh berhati2 lg pilih hotel bintang 5 dgn harga yg sesuai bintang 5. 5. Exterior hotel bagus cakep kaya difoto. Pantai di belakang hotel nya tidak bs utk renang."

Lalu pagi jam 05.00 ac kembali bermasalah dan tidak nyala lagi. Kami panggil lg room servis dan dibetulkan kembali. Saat itu kami mnt tolong cek water heater krn air angat nya knp sangat tidak terasa hangat. Lalu operator tsbt mengecek water heater dan ternyata memang bermasalah water heaternya.

Sy stay tgl 22-23 Maret 2022 memakai 2 voucher dari travel**a (yg ternyata pihak trv mengambil dari pihak lain, yaitu MG). Voucher tsb atas nama teman saya dari Jakarta yg batal ke Bali shg dihibahkan ke sy. 1. Check in paling aneh bin ribet yg pernah sy alami. Sy tunjukkan evoucher dan KTP teman sy. Ditolak. Diminta suruh bikin surat pernyataan tertulis dari teman sy yg menyatakan bahwa sy diberi hak utk memakai voucher. Alasannya: takut ntar ada yg check in lg pake voucher tsb. Sudah kubilang, sy bersedian guarantee dng cc sy, silahkan diopen. Klo ada org lain check in, sy bersedia bayar. Tetap tidak mau dan tetap diminta surat pernyataan. 2. Sy stay 1 dewasa dengan 3 anak umur 11, 9, dan 3th. Voucher sy ada 2 lho, 2 kamar. Sy diminta membayar extra person 350rb perorang x2 menjadi 700rb. Krn di voucher tertulisnya 1 kamar 1 adult. Sy bilang: 2 anak kan seharga 1 dws. Harusnya bisa 1 room, trus yg 3th harusnya free. Tapi petugas FO nama Ratna dan staf reservasi nama Adit tetap ngotot tidak bisa. Pilihannya sy harus booking 4 kamar (@1 orang) atau 2 kamar +700rb. Gila bener. Peraturan kaku macam apa lah itu. Kata si Adit: email yg kami terima seperti itu. Kujawab: tapi hotel kan ya punya kebijaksanaan sendiri ya, masak iya anak umur 3th di kamar sendiri. Seperti aturan breakfast ada hotel yg free dibawah 3th, ada yg 6th… itu kan kebijakan hotel bukan kebijakan yg diatur oleh pihak travel. Di FO sudah kena 2 masalah itu, udah niat banget sy cancel check in dan pulang aja. Ternyata ada orang baik yg memberikan 1 room lagi kepada sy sehingga akhirnya sy dpt 3 kamar dan kata si adit dikasi free utk yg bungsu umur 3th itu. Pengalaman paling menggelikan, menjengkelkan, bikin super emosi….peraturan kaku dan kesannya mengada2. Masuk kamar. Kebersihan 75%. Debu di area meja minibar dan kamar mandi, kesan lama gak dimasukin orang. AC gak dingin. Air kamar mandi lama panasnya. Channel TV cuma 10 aja dan membosankan. Kolam renang dng kebersihan 75%, ada daun2, sayap burung, jentik nyamuk. Sy lihat ada papan notif yg menuliskan harga paket day pass 25rb perorang sudah dapat 1 french fries, 1 es teh dan bisa berenang sepuasnya. Dalam hati, lumayan murah. Saat mau order, lha kok french fries harga 35rb, nasgor 80rb. Kutanyakanlah… yg sana 25rb udah french fries+teh, kok ini french fries aja 35. Kata stafnya: iya itu harga paket, klo yg ini harga ala carte. Terus terang sy gak mudeng. Overall, gak bakal balik lagi disini. Klo ada yang sedang mempertimbangkan untuk stay disini, perhatikan baik2 ya, banyak jebakan betmen nya, peraturan kaku dan mengada-ngada."

Banyaknya perbaikan besar yang belum selesai yang dapat mengakibatkan cedera serius sungguh mengejutkan. Sebagai seorang arsitek, jelas bahwa hanya waktu, kurangnya dana, dan kelalaian yang memungkinkan sebuah properti mengalami kerusakan hingga tingkat yang tidak aman. Ada tanda di meja resepsionis yang mengatakan bahwa proyek-proyek tersebut merupakan akibat dari badai baru-baru ini, tetapi sayangnya itu tidak benar…. Semua pagar logam terkorosi begitu parah sehingga bahkan tidak lagi utuh, bahkan dari lantai 2 dan 3 atas. Masalah sebesar ini membutuhkan waktu, bukan badai yang hanya terjadi sekali…. Semua dek kayu di seluruh bangunan lapuk dan melorot. Anda benar-benar jatuh melalui lubang saat berjalan. Logam berkarat dan paku di mana-mana. Belum lagi lubang langit-langit besar yang terlihat di seluruh properti. Para tamu seharusnya diberi helm pengaman. Kami sangat terganggu oleh kurangnya keamanan di seluruh gedung sehingga kami tidak berani memasuki kolam renang. Saya tidak akan pernah membawa anak kecil ke sini. Jendela di kamar lantai atas bisa dibuka selebar minimal 1 m tanpa kait pengaman. Anak-anak bisa langsung mencondongkan badan ke luar dan jatuh. Ini semua seperti gugatan hukum yang menunggu untuk terjadi. Sayangnya, kami mengemas tas kami hanya setelah beberapa jam dan pergi. Saya turut prihatin dengan staf yang baik dan membantu yang bekerja di sini dan mendoakan yang terbaik bagi mereka. Mereka jelas merupakan anugerah yang membuat tempat ini tetap buka….😔"

"466.","Melly Mo","24","2025-08-14","1","Kecewa dan buang-buang waktu! Kami memesan Suite Ocean View untuk liburan akhir pekan, berharap bisa bersantai dan melepas lelah selama beberapa hari. Waktu check-in yang tertera adalah pukul 14.00, tetapi kami tiba pukul 16.00 setelah menjelajahi area sekitar, berharap langsung menuju kamar dan menikmati matahari terbenam. Sejak awal, pengalaman ini sudah membuat frustrasi. Resepsionis tidak dapat menemukan reservasi saya dan secara terbuka berdiskusi dengan staf lain bahwa pemesanan saya tidak sengaja dibatalkan oleh sistem mereka. Saya tidak pernah menerima pemberitahuan apa pun dari resor atau platform pemesanan pihak ketiga. Setelah sekitar 15 menit, mereka memberi tahu kami bahwa kamar belum siap dan meminta kami menunggu di restoran. Tidak ada kompensasi atau ucapan terima kasih atas kesalahan mereka, hanya maaf sampai kami meminta check-out terlambat untuk menutupi biaya dan menunggu satu jam lagi. Kami menghubungi staf restoran tentang kamar kami karena matahari terbenam sudah dekat. Mereka menelepon resepsionis, yang mengatakan akan menunggu 10 menit lagi. 15 menit kemudian, masih belum ada kabar. Frustrasi, kami kembali ke resepsionis, siap untuk membatalkan dan meminta pengembalian uang. Tiba-tiba, mereka bilang kamar sudah siap dan menawarkan check-out terlambat gratis serta sarapan, tetapi saat itu, kerusakan sudah terjadi. Karena kami memesannya melalui pihak ketiga dan tidak ada pembatalan, prosesnya jadi lebih rumit! Dan sudah hampir jam 6 sore! Selamat tinggal matahari terbenam! Lebih parah lagi, mereka mengaku sudah mencari kami di restoran 10 menit sebelumnya tetapi tidak dapat menemukan kami. Hal ini tidak masuk akal karena kami baru saja berbicara dengan staf restoran 15 menit sebelumnya dan tidak pergi ke mana pun, hanya menunggu. Jelas, tidak ada komunikasi antara resepsionis dan restoran. 🚩 Mereka juga bilang barang-barang kami sudah ada di kamar, tetapi ketika kami bersikeras untuk membatalkan, mereka mengembalikannya hanya dalam beberapa menit, yang sangat tidak mungkin mengingat betapa luasnya properti tersebut. Hal ini membuat saya merasa mereka hanya meninggalkan barang-barang kami di lobi selama ini. 🚩 Karena keterlambatan dan penanganan yang buruk, kami terpaksa memesan akomodasi lain di menit-menit terakhir hanya untuk menyelamatkan sisa perjalanan kami. Secara keseluruhan, itu benar-benar buang-buang waktu dan sangat mengecewakan. Komunikasi yang buruk, informasi yang salah, dan kurangnya akuntabilitas merusak ekspektasi kami sejak awal. Jelas bukan liburan santai yang kami rencanakan."

Namun mereka menemukan cara untuk menempatkan kami di ruangan yang menghadap langsung ke perancah, sehingga para pekerja dapat mengawasi kami. Tidak menghormati privasi, padahal jelas ada kamar lain yang tersedia. Area kolam juga dimanjakan dengan perancah yang terlihat dan kebisingan yang menyertainya saat Anda beristirahat di kolam (kebisingan konstruksi) yang benar-benar merusak suasana. Kami meminta kamar dengan bak mandi karena kekecewaannya: penolakan kategoris, tidak ada proposal alternatif, tidak ada isyarat komersial - meskipun hotel ini jauh dari penuh. Dari segi peralatan, gym tidak lengkap (beberapa mesin rusak), dan toilet sauna kotor, tidak ada pembersihan atau pembuangan handuk bekas. Hal yang paling membuat frustrasi adalah bahwa di hostel atau homestay tertentu dengan tarif €5 per malam, kami diterima dengan lebih baik dan diakomodasi dengan lebih baik. Di sini, kami ingin memanjakan diri selama sebulan perjalanan dengan menghabiskan €65 per malam… untuk hasil yang mengecewakan dan kenangan buruk. Jelas, kami tidak membayar banyak untuk apa pun. Poin positifnya tetap sama: terima kasih yang sebesar-besarnya kepada staf restoran, yang menyenangkan dan profesional, yang sedikit meningkatkan tingkat kunjungan kami."
"470.","Spencer Plews","1","2025-07-14","1","Dari mana harus memulai? 1. Kutu kasur di mana-mana. Baik saya maupun pasangan saya DIPENUHI gigitan pada malam pertama. 2. Sebagian besar fasilitas ditutup, bahkan kolam renang di resor bintang 5 pun ditutup. 3. Kolam renang pribadi jelas tidak pernah dibersihkan, airnya berwarna putih krem ​​dengan gumpalan jamur dan bahkan plester bekas pakai dari tamu sebelumnya yang beredar di sekitar kolam. 3. Kusen pintu telah lepas, yang mencegah pintu kami tertutup dan terkunci. Seorang anggota staf datang dan memperbaikinya dengan memukulnya beberapa kali dengan tangannya, lalu memberi tahu kami untuk tidak mendorong pintu terlalu keras atau kusen akan lepas dan pintu saya tidak akan bisa terkunci dan tertutup. Selain itu, kunci hanya memiliki 1 dari 4 sekrup. 4. Pegangan tangga di lantai 4 hanya ditahan oleh 1 sekrup, dengan kayu lapuk yang seharusnya melindungi kami. 5. Jamur di kamar mandi, tidak ada air panas dari keran, peralatan makan kotor di kamar, darah di sarung bantal, dan kotoran serta jamur di tirai. 6. Langit-langitnya berlubang besar akibat badai beberapa bulan lalu, yang sedang mereka perbaiki. 7. Pelayan di restoran hanya sedikit atau bahkan tidak bisa berbahasa Inggris, salah mencatat pesanan kami empat kali (vegetarian tetapi malah mendapat ayam 4 kali) dan marah kepada kami ketika kami meminta hidangan yang benar. 8. Makanan kami membutuhkan waktu setidaknya 1 jam untuk dimasak dan diantar, dan paling lama 2 jam 15 menit (1 hidangan nasi, 1 makanan penutup), keduanya basah kuyup dan jelas telah diletakkan di bangku untuk beberapa waktu sebelum disajikan. 9. Mungkin yang terburuk dari semuanya, seorang anggota staf menjanjikan 2x voucher senilai 1.500.000 untuk menonton video promosi selama 90 menit. iPad mereka untuk menonton video hanya tersedia pada hari terakhir kami di hotel, jadi kami diberitahu bahwa kami dapat menagihkan biaya ke kamar dan akan dikreditkan di akhir perjalanan. Namun kenyataannya tidak demikian, dan setelah istri saya memesan layanan kamar pukul 10 malam, staf hotel memaksanya untuk membayar, dan menolak untuk meninggalkan kamar (terlepas dari apa yang dikatakan istri saya tentang kredit ke kamar, seperti yang dikatakan oleh staf hotel). Ketika saya menyampaikan hal ini kepada resepsionis, mereka tidak mengerti apa yang saya bicarakan. Mereka memanggil manajer, yang MENYALAHKAN staf hotel yang sebenarnya bukan karyawan Wyndham dan merupakan kontraktor untuk bisnis lain, meskipun ia mengenakan seragam staf di area resepsionis, berpakaian persis sama dengan staf lainnya. Manajer tersebut meminta maaf berkali-kali, bersikeras akan menyelesaikan masalah ini tetapi tidak berhasil. Secara keseluruhan, ini adalah hotel terburuk dan paling menjijikkan yang pernah saya kunjungi. Staf yang tidak berpendidikan, manajemen yang buruk, dan bangunan serta fasilitas yang jelas tidak mendapatkan perawatan dan pembersihan antara tamu. Saya tidak akan kembali ke hotel Wyndham mana pun dan akan memberi tahu orang lain hal yang sama. JAUHILAH!"

Staf restoran, yang tampak seperti anak magang SMA yang kurang berpengalaman, kesulitan memenuhi permintaan pelanggan. Meskipun kamar-kamarnya bersih, kondisinya sudah usang, dengan dinding yang lecet dan cat yang mengelupas. Tisu toiletnya di bawah standar, lebih buruk daripada yang Anda temukan di toilet umum.

Penginapan kami baru-baru ini di properti Wyndham benar-benar bencana, pengalaman hotel terburuk yang pernah kami alami. Dari kondisi yang tidak bersih hingga masalah perawatan yang berbahaya dan praktik yang menipu, hotel ini membahayakan kesehatan dan keselamatan. Saat tiba, saya dan pasangan langsung digigit kutu busuk. Kolam renang pribadi berbahaya secara biologis, penuh dengan air putih seperti krim, potongan jamur, dan bahkan perban bekas. Di dalam kamar, kami menemukan darah di sarung bantal, kotoran dan jamur di tirai, dan peralatan makan yang kotor. Kamar mandi berjamur dan tidak ada air panas. Yang menambah kumuhnya, langit-langitnya berlubang besar akibat badai sebelumnya. Integritas struktural hotel mengkhawatirkan. Kusen pintu kami rusak, sehingga tidak dapat ditutup dan dikunci dengan benar, dengan perbaikan yang melibatkan anggota staf yang memukulnya dan memperingatkan kami untuk tidak mendorongnya terlalu keras. Pegangan tangga di lantai 4 tertahan dengan tidak aman oleh satu sekrup dengan kayu yang membusuk. Pelayanannya juga sangat buruk. Staf restoran hanya bisa berbahasa Inggris, sehingga terjadi empat pesanan yang salah (makanan vegetarian diganti dengan ayam), dan menjadi marah ketika kami meminta hidangan yang benar. Makanan datang dalam waktu yang sangat lama (1-2 jam) dan sering kali disajikan dalam keadaan dingin dan basah. Mungkin masalah yang paling parah adalah promosi yang menipu. Seorang anggota staf menjanjikan dua voucher senilai 1.500.000 IDR untuk menonton video promosi. Ketika iPad untuk menonton video tersebut baru tersedia pada hari terakhir kami, kami diberi tahu bahwa kami dapat menagih biaya kamar dan biaya tersebut akan dikreditkan. Itu bohong. Istri saya dipaksa membayar layanan kamar larut malam oleh seorang anggota staf yang menolak meninggalkan kamar. Ketika kami membicarakan hal ini dengan resepsionis, manajer menyalahkan kontraktor (meskipun dia berseragam) dan memberikan permintaan maaf kosong tanpa menyelesaikan masalah. Hotel ini merupakan bukti staf yang tidak berpendidikan, manajemen yang buruk, dan kurangnya perawatan dan pembersihan. Kami tidak akan kembali ke hotel Wyndham mana pun dan sangat menyarankan yang lain untuk menjauh!"
"474.","rahul singh","4","2025-06-14","1","Ulasan Hotel – Penginapan yang Sangat Mengecewakan Saya baru-baru ini menginap di hotel ini selama 3 hari, dan sayangnya, pengalamannya jauh dari yang saya harapkan—terutama dari properti yang mengklaim bintang 5. Sejak hari pertama, kami mengalami masalah dengan AC. AC-nya tidak berfungsi dengan baik, dan kami akhirnya berkeringat sepanjang malam. Meskipun sudah melaporkan masalah ini, masalahnya tidak teratasi. Pada hari ketiga, kami dipindahkan ke kamar lain, dan mengalami masalah AC yang sama persis. Kami harus duduk di lobi selama lebih dari satu jam sementara mereka mencoba memperbaikinya—sesuatu yang seharusnya sudah ditangani jauh sebelumnya. Standar kebersihannya sangat buruk. Kami menemukan seekor kecoa di kamar mandi, dan ketika petugas kebersihan datang, staf hanya menyemprotnya dengan insektisida dan meninggalkannya begitu saja. Tidak ada upaya untuk membersihkan atau mensanitasi area tersebut setelahnya. Yang menambah kekecewaan, hiburan di dalam kamar sangat terbatas. Dari 27 saluran televisi, 7 di antaranya hanyalah iklan untuk resor itu sendiri. Tidak ada TV pintar atau fasilitas modern apa pun yang Anda harapkan dari hotel sekelas ini. Secara keseluruhan, pengalaman menginap kami sangat tidak menyenangkan. Saya tidak akan merekomendasikan hotel ini dan sangat mendesak manajemen untuk meningkatkan fasilitas dan layanan mereka secara serius jika mereka ingin memenuhi harapan tamu, bahkan yang paling mendasar sekalipun, apalagi standar bintang 5."

Karena ini hotel bintang 5, tentu saja ekspektasi saya tinggi terhadap pelayanan yang diberikan. Namun, harapan itu pupus ketika saya hendak pulang dan membayar makanan dan minuman di kasir. Staf kasirnya sangat singkat, tidak ramah, dan tidak sopan. Ketika saya ingin bertanya berapa pajak yang dikenakan?, dan jawabannya adalah saya diminta untuk melihat langsung ke layar komputer sambil meninggalkan saya sendiri. Ya ampun, serius?? Ini akan menjadi pengalaman pertama dan terakhir saya berkunjung ke sana. Maaf, saya memberi penilaian buruk karena sesuai dengan apa yang saya alami."

Sangat disayangkan karena potensinya sangat besar, tetapi ini merupakan bahaya kesehatan dan keselamatan yang SANGAT BESAR. Stafnya sangat ramah dan berusaha melakukan yang terbaik dengan apa yang mereka miliki, tetapi yang kami sadari adalah manajemen/pemilik jelas tidak peduli jika bangunannya runtuh dengan semua tamu masih di dalamnya. Mereka juga tidak peduli jika semua makanan dan minuman tidak tersedia dan menolak memberi staf wewenang untuk memesan stok lagi (kami diberi tahu). Secara keseluruhan, tidak akan direkomendasikan, TERUTAMA jika Anda memiliki anak, Anda akan SANGAT kecewa."

Selain itu, lantainya licin, menimbulkan risiko keselamatan, dan keset kamar mandi awalnya tidak disediakan. Akibatnya, kami harus mempersingkat masa inap dan pindah ke hotel lain, kehilangan dua malam tanpa kompensasi apa pun, selain permintaan maaf dari manajer.

Saya sarankan untuk tinggal di dekat pasar Ubud agar lebih mudah diakses. Saya memesan makan malam di resor ini, dan saya belum pernah makan makanan seburuk itu sebelumnya. Mereka bahkan tidak tahu cara memasak, makanannya sangat buruk. Pengalaman yang sangat buruk yang saya alami di resor ini.

Benar-benar tidak bertanggung jawab! - Kamar bergetar setiap kali angin kencang bertiup. Tidak bisa tidur nyenyak di malam hari karena getaran ruangan. - Restoran Pantai Jivva tidak seperti yang diharapkan. Waktu penyajian terlalu lama. Jumlah makanan dan minuman terbatas.

"484.","Shannon Johnstone","7","2025-01-14","1","Pelayanannya sangat buruk, saya tidak menyarankan untuk menginap di sini. Kami memesan beberapa pijat 2 minggu sebelum kami menginap dan sudah dikonfirmasi. Pagi harinya, hotel membatalkannya karena mereka memiliki pemesanan grup menit terakhir. Kami menjelaskan bahwa kami sudah memesan, dan ini adalah satu-satunya waktu yang cocok. Ketika kami tiba di hotel untuk check-in, mereka mencoba lagi untuk langsung mengajak kami pijat bahkan sebelum kami mendapatkan kartu kunci. Akhirnya, ketika kami tiba di waktu yang disepakati, mereka menunda kami setengah jam setelah kami menunggu 15 menit. Pijatnya sendiri menyenangkan, hanya saja para pemijatnya sibuk dengan ponsel mereka. Ada juga masalah dengan pembayaran di mana eftpos tidak berfungsi, dan mereka ingin kami mengambil uang tunai untuk membayar. Mereka setuju kami dapat membayar di pagi hari, 5 menit kemudian resepsionis menelepon untuk meminta kami mentransfer uang, meskipun kami diberitahu bahwa kami tidak dapat menambahkannya ke kamar karena merupakan layanan terpisah. Restoran - mereka hampir tidak memiliki stok minuman di menu mereka dan memaksakan semangat lokal mereka. Makanan - Saya memesan bakso dan spageti nabati, dan mereka memberi saya daging yang baru saya sadari SETELAH saya makan satu. Mereka segera mengambilnya dan menggantinya dengan makanan saya yang sebenarnya, dan mengatakan mereka akan memberi kami minuman gratis sebagai permintaan maaf. Ketika kami menerima tagihan, kami harus membayar semuanya. Fasilitas - dek di sekitar kolam renang taman sangat perlu diganti, paku-paku mencuat dan kayu tidak terpasang, sangat membahayakan keselamatan. Kulkas di kamar kami tidak bisa menyimpan makanan dingin. Kami pikir kami telah memesan resor yang bagus untuk malam terakhir kami di Bali, tetapi ternyata sangat kecewa."

"487.","Alex Koeberlein","13","2024-01-14","1","Hotel mewah yang terlalu mahal Kamarnya sendiri bagus, namun pelayanannya buruk dan harganya terlalu tinggi. Kami belum pernah mengalami keramahtamahan seperti ini di tempat lain di Bali. Tagihan restoran tidak bisa dibebankan ke kamar kami, jadi pukul 22.30, seorang karyawan meminta kami untuk segera membayar tagihan, bukan keesokan paginya. Stafnya hampir tidak bisa berbahasa Inggris, dan ketika mereka mencoba, kami tidak mengerti apa pun. Lokasinya bagus, tetapi Anda tidak bisa berenang di pantai. Selain itu, Anda hanya bisa berkeliling di depan hotel dengan taksi lokal (yang harganya lebih mahal). Jika Anda ingin menggunakan Grab, sayangnya Anda harus berjalan 300 meter ke jalan atau bersedia membayar lebih untuk pergi dari hotel. Jika Anda benar-benar ingin melihat Bali, Anda harus mencari hotel lain di daerah yang berbeda!"

Kamar mandinya kumuh dan perlu dibersihkan. Kolam renang di kamar kami kotor dan airnya keruh. Saya pasti tidak ingin berendam di dalamnya! Kolam renang utama juga kotor.

"491.","Rosco Andrew","124","2024-01-14","1","TINGGAL DI TEMPAT LAIN... TOLONG Ketika Anda dijanjikan penginapan mewah dengan fasilitas baru dan bersih, tetapi Anda sangat kecewa. Ya, stafnya sopan, tetapi itu hanya di permukaan. Resepsionisnya tidak teratur dan berantakan, dan saya bisa melihat wisatawan lain mengalami masalah saat check-in. Bangunan dan infrastrukturnya tua dan sangat kuno, dengan fasad yang runtuh atau terkelupas, kabel-kabel terbuka, dan lubang-lubang di dinding yang perlu diperbaiki. Pipa-pipa air untuk sistem kebakaran berkarat, tidak tahan terhadap tekanan yang melewatinya. KAMAR PERTAMA KOTOR, Anda langsung disambut dengan bau jamur hitam saat masuk dan baunya tidak hilang. Rambut hitam panjang tertinggal di wastafel, pancuran, dan area utama, lalu ke tempat tidur, bercak darah segar (10 mm atau lebih besar) di seprai dan seprai, juga noda riasan atau kotoran/seks. Jorok dan yang lebih parah lagi, kulkasnya tidak berfungsi, lampunya mati, tidak dingin. Telepon resepsionis, langsung ditutup setelah percakapan pertama. Terus menelepon balik, sepertinya ID penelepon ada untungnya buat mereka, akhirnya kami pergi ke resepsionis lagi untuk mendapatkan kulkas baru dan/atau kamar yang lebih bersih. Saya tidak akan diabaikan di resepsionis mana pun, di mana pun di dunia, karena saya punya resor kecil, saya tahu betapa sulitnya bekerja dengan tamu, jadi kalau Anda menginap di sini (JANGAN!!!) dan ada masalah, silakan berdiri di resepsionis sampai manajer akhirnya dibangunkan dari tidurnya untuk menangani masalah tersebut. Saya hampir saja menjatuhkan kulkas untuk menyampaikan maksud saya!!! Saya harap pelancong solo yang juga mengalami masalah mendapatkan kamar jacuzzi seperti yang dijanjikan, karena sikap acuh tak acuh resepsionis juga membuatnya kesal! Masalah kamar kami akhirnya terselesaikan dengan kamar yang lebih bersih, tapi di ambang batas. Tempat ini perlu direnovasi atau akan berubah menjadi istana kumuh. Perusahaan itu mengklaim ramah lingkungan... namun dari balkon saya bisa melihat drum klorin tua yang sebagian terbuka (40 liter) berkarat di semak-semak, dengan tanda HAZNO masih terlihat jelas, yang beracun bagi kehidupan laut. Mungkin jika mereka menggunakannya di kolam renang dan kolam balkon, airnya tidak akan berwarna hijau keruh dan menjijikkan yang membuat Anda TIDAK ingin mencelupkan kaki ke dalamnya. Lagipula sampahnya dibuang begitu saja di atas pagar ajaib resor, dan itu jelas sampah resor. Saya menemukan fitting lampu fluorescent tua (semuanya) dan sakelar lampu yang rusak. BENARKAH??? Ruang makan, hati-hati di kaki, deknya rusak, begitu pula makanannya. Sedikit lebih baik daripada lubang pembuangan tentara. Tapi banyak buah segar, tetaplah makan di sana. Untuk memenuhi syarat saya memberikan ulasan yang buruk dan benar-benar dapat membuktikannya. Saya telah memiliki dan menjalankan resor kecil saya sendiri dan bekerja di tim pemeliharaan sebuah penginapan mewah bintang lima di Selandia Baru. Saya juga orang Kiwi. Membaca ulasan lain, sepertinya resor ini membayar beberapa wisatawan untuk menulis ulasan yang bagus. Ya, ulasan ini panjang dan terima kasih sudah membacanya. Saya bukan pelancong sejati (istri saya juga bukan), tetapi tempat ini tidak pantas mendapatkan uang hasil jerih payah dan waktu liburan Anda. Carilah yang lebih baik. TOLONG"

"497.","Kat Agres","22","2023-01-14","1","Ini adalah alasan terburuk untuk hotel bintang 5 yang pernah saya lihat. Seharusnya bintang 2. Saya rasa saya belum pernah melihat hotel yang lebih berantakan atau layanan pelanggan yang lebih buruk. Komunikasinya benar-benar buruk, dan kemampuan berbahasa Inggrisnya sangat minim. Tanda peringatan pertama ada saat check-in. Kami tiba tepat pukul 14.00 untuk check-in, dan kami adalah orang pertama di lobi, tetapi mereka tetap membutuhkan waktu 25 menit untuk check-in kami. Entah kenapa butuh waktu begitu lama. Kamar pertama yang mereka tunjukkan penuh dengan nyamuk - ada puluhan! - jadi solusinya adalah menyemprotkan semprotan anti-nyamuk ke mana-mana (di atas handuk, barang-barang kami, dll.)... Saya merasa mual selama beberapa jam berikutnya setelah menghirup baunya. Setelah menyemprot kamar mandi, 6 nyamuk mati di bak mandi saja (lihat foto). Akhirnya saya harus pergi ke lobi untuk meminta kamar baru, dan mereka bilang tidak ada kamar lain. Tetapi ketika saya bertanya tentang kamar di sebelahnya, mereka berkata, oh ya, akan siap dalam dua jam. Ternyata tidak. Butuh waktu 5 jam, dan tidak ada yang menyerahkan kartu kunci agar kami bisa masuk (seperti yang kami minta, dua kali). Ada banyak bahaya keamanan, ketidaknyamanan, pelanggaran privasi, dan komunikasi yang buruk; saya akan mencantumkan poin-poin utamanya di bawah ini: - Komunikasi sangat buruk: hampir tidak ada yang bisa berbahasa Inggris, jadi menelepon untuk meminta apa pun dari kamar hampir mustahil. Misalnya, setelah menelepon dua kali untuk meminta selimut dan dijanjikan, mereka tidak pernah mengirimkannya. - KURANGNYA PRIVASI: Ada konstruksi dengan perancah dan orang-orang bekerja di luar jendela kami setiap hari! Astaga. Tidak ada privasi di kamar kami pada siang hari karena alasan ini (Lihat foto) - Jaring laba-laba di sekitar cermin di kamar mandi dan di samping perlengkapan mandi yang mereka tinggalkan untuk kami - Brankas di kamar kami tidak berfungsi dan kulkas mini rusak - Mereka memberi kami satu handuk besar dan tidak ada handuk tangan untuk kamar twin dengan dua orang dewasa (tidak pernah mendapatkan handuk tangan). Handuk besar sudah tua, berlubang cukup besar (lihat gambar), dan berbau asap yang menyengat. - Diiklankan sebagai laporan pantai, tetapi tidak ada kolam renang di pantai karena ombak tinggi, dan tampaknya airnya tidak bersih karena limpasan dari pertanian di dekatnya. - Air kolam keruh dan hijau! Saya bahkan tidak bisa melihat dasar kolam, jadi tidak akan membiarkan balita saya berenang di dalamnya. Menjijikkan. Kami membayar (dua kali) untuk pergi ke resor terdekat untuk berenang di kolam renang biasa. Lihat foto air kolam. - Ada anjing liar yang gatal-gatal karena kutu dan mengikuti kami saat sarapan. - Pelayanan lambat: Kami berangkat untuk tur sehari sekitar pukul 08.30, dan setelah kembali 7 jam kemudian, mereka baru saja mulai membereskan salah satu kamar kami (yang lainnya belum dibereskan)... mengganggu balita kami untuk tidur siang! Lalu 10 menit setelah kami masuk kamar (kami harus menunggu sampai mereka membereskan kamar), tiga petugas pemeliharaan mengetuk pintu kami karena mereka perlu memperbaiki kolam kaki di ujung kamar kami :( - Kolam kaki itu juga keruh dan banyak serangga serta tanaman mati yang mengapung di atasnya. Meski terdengar menyenangkan, kami tidak menggunakannya sekali pun (terlihat menjijikkan). - KERAS: Ada musik keras dan seorang pria berbicara keras/berteriak di megafon di pantai dengan sekelompok orang pada pukul 7 pagi… kami mendengarnya (dan itu membangunkan kami) sampai ke ujung gedung di lantai dua hingga atas. Suaranya sangat keras, dan mereka melakukan ini selama lebih dari satu jam. 🤦‍♀️ - BAHAYA KESELAMATAN: Sebagian langit-langit runtuh tepat di sebelah kamar kami. Lihat foto. Selain itu, integritas struktural bangunannya dipertanyakan - ruangan itu berguncang hebat setiap kali ada ombak. Bahkan, seluruh *bangunan* berguncang setiap kali ada ombak besar - itu cukup untuk membangunkan kami beberapa saat. kali di malam hari. - Mereka menghilangkan deposit $100 kami 3 kali (sangat sulit untuk menemukan deposit itu di sistem mereka setiap kali) Dan saya bisa terus bercerita! Sekali lagi, pelayanannya buruk sekali. Bukan hotel bintang 5, bahkan tidak mendekati! (Apa tidak ada pihak berwenang yang memeriksa hal semacam ini? Sejujurnya saya tidak percaya dengan peringkat bintangnya.) Intinya: JANGAN MENGINAP DI HOTEL INI. Hotel ini tidak aman, pelayanannya buruk, dan fasilitas dasarnya kurang."

Kami harus menonton saluran TV biasa. Tidak direkomendasikan. Suite King dengan pemandangan laut, sangat dekat dengan laut, mendengar ombak dan suara keras sepanjang malam. Tidak bisa tidur ketika ombak besar datang, seluruh kamar dan tempat tidur bergetar. Kami berada di lantai atas. Suasananya kurang nyaman di malam hari karena kami akan terbangun karena mengira itu gempa bumi. Selain itu, pada malam pertama kami mengalami 5 kali pemadaman listrik sehingga kami duduk di kamar hotel dalam kegelapan, tidak ada senter atau apa pun yang disediakan. Seharusnya menginap selama 7 malam, tapi kami menginap selama 3 malam karena ada juga anjing-anjing liar yang berkeliaran di sekitar area hotel dan restoran. Pada malam hari, mereka akan berkelahi, melolong, dan menangis selama 20 menit, yang akan membangunkan semua orang. Hewan-hewan ini juga sering masuk ke kolam renang setelah jam operasional. Hotelnya tampak bagus, tetapi jika diperhatikan lebih dekat, Anda akan melihat bahwa hotel ini sudah mulai runtuh. Hotel ini sangat mengecewakan bagi waralaba Wyhndam dan saya tidak merekomendasikannya kepada siapa pun yang ingin berlibur untuk bersantai dan melepas lelah karena sepanjang waktu kami merasa cemas dan gelisah.

Kompleks hotel yang bobrok Lift rusak TV rusak Perabotan kamar rusak Pusat kebugarannya payah, dengan beban hingga 10 kg Saya juga tidak mengerti mengapa, dengan begitu banyak staf, mereka tidak membersihkan permukaan kaca atau merawatnya dengan lebih baik; kalau begitu kesan keseluruhannya mungkin akan lebih baik. Areanya sendiri tidak menarik. Jalan menuju restoran menyeramkan dan berbahaya dalam kegelapan. Yang mungkin membedakan hotel ini dari hotel bintang 5 lainnya adalah kopinya.

Kami datang untuk sarapan pukul 8-9 pagi dan selalu mendapati makanan habis dan mereka tidak pernah menambahnya!! Dan ketika Anda ingin bersantai di kolam renang, mereka SELALU kehabisan handuk!! (Dan ini pukul 3-4 sore) Semua pelayan dan petugas layanan tampaknya tidak berpengalaman. Anda bertanya sesuatu kepada mereka, mereka tidak punya jawaban. Kamar tidak akan dibersihkan setiap hari kecuali Anda menelepon resepsionis dan meminta pembersihan. Dan ketika mereka membersihkan kamar, mereka hanya membersihkan tempat tidur Anda, mereka tidak menambah perlengkapan mandi atau membersihkan apa pun. Dengan harga $125 per malam, sama sekali tidak sepadan dengan uang Anda. Ohh dan jika Anda masih bekerja selama liburan Anda, semoga berhasil membuka file atau situs web apa pun dengan WIFI mereka!! Koneksi terburuk yang pernah ada! Kami harus menggunakan data seluler kami. TV-nya sangat sederhana, hanya saluran lokal, yang sebenarnya tidak terlalu saya pedulikan karena kami menonton Disney atau Netflix, tetapi karena wifi-nya sangat buruk, kami juga tidak bisa menontonnya!! 🤣🤣🤣 Satu-satunya hal baik yang bisa saya katakan adalah kami memilih kamar yang lebih besar di Ocean Front. Anda mendapatkan pemandangan laut yang sangat bagus dan mendengar suara ombak tanpa henti. Tapi apakah itu sepadan dengan semua kesulitan dan kekecewaan yang terus-menerus??

Nah, sayangnya kami memesan kamar hotel langsung secara online selama 5 hari. Tips: pesan satu malam saja secara online terlebih dahulu - jika Anda ingin tinggal lebih lama, baru putuskan... Kesimpulannya, benar-benar bintang 5 - saya rasa tidak. Sebagai perbandingan, Wyndham Hotel di Jakarta Selatan, di sisi lain, ya. Dengan harga lebih dari 1,2 juta IDR termasuk sarapan per malam, Anda seharusnya mengharapkan sedikit lebih banyak. Perlu dicatat bahwa stafnya sangat ramah dan berusaha membantu.

Teknisi datang dan menjelaskan bahwa mesin air panasnya 1:1 untuk setiap kamar, dan tabungnya tidak terlalu besar, jadi ketika kami menggunakannya terlalu banyak, perlu sekitar setengah jam untuk memanaskan air kembali. Tidak masuk akal bagi saya, karena pemanas air di rumah saya tidak terlalu aneh. Tapi saya mencoba menerimanya dan menggunakan ketel untuk menambahkan air panas. Lalu, ada suara bip aneh yang tiba-tiba muncul dari atap kamar mandi. Dan setelah istri saya selesai menggunakan kamar mandi, saya harus mengeluh (berulang kali). Teknisi datang, membawa tangga dan memeriksa langit-langit. Dia bilang mesin air panas rusak dan mereka perlu mengganti modulnya. 🤦‍♂️ Jadi setelah saya basah kuyup karena hujan deras, saya harus mandi dengan air dingin. Bukankah ini malam yang tepat untuk liburan..?! Kami demam tak lama setelah mandi dan untungnya saya membawa parasetamol. Keesokan harinya, manajer menawarkan kami kamar sementara untuk kami gunakan sementara teknisi memperbaiki air panas kami. Saya pikir itu bukan ide yang bagus jadi mereka perlu mencari solusi lain. Mereka menawarkan saya vila tetapi kami tidak suka kamar dan pemandangannya. Setelah memeriksa, manajer akhirnya datang dengan Ocean Front Suite sebagai kamar pengganti. Saya sudah memeriksanya dan ternyata lebih baik daripada suite kami sebelumnya, jadi kami memutuskan untuk menerimanya. Pemandangannya menakjubkan, tapi sejujurnya, manajemennya sangat buruk. Sarapannya berantakan. Saya datang ke restoran dan mendapati 50% menu prasmanan sarapan sudah habis. Peralatan makan tidak tersedia dan kami harus memesan dan menunggu setelah mengambil makanan. Yang terburuk adalah, bagian pemasaran yang saya hubungi untuk memesan kamar tidak membalas keluhan terakhir saya melalui pesan teks. Saya pasti tidak akan kembali ke Wyndham Tamansari Jivva lagi. Mungkin kalau manajemennya diganti dan ulasannya semakin baik, kita lihat saja nanti."

Kemudian, seorang karyawan datang dan memasukkan kantong plastik ke dalam lubang tersebut... Stafnya tidak kompeten, kurang perhatian, dan lambat! Ada jamur di wastafel dan di kamar mandi kami! Kami menikmati pijat Bali. Selebihnya, kami bertanya-tanya bagaimana hotel ini bisa mendapatkan peringkat bintang 5..."
"508.","astaganaga apajaa","1","2024-01-14","1","Beberapa bagian kurang terawat, Spot-spotnya kotor, bahkan ada sarang burung. Kolam renang dekat pantai kotor, ada pasir yang masuk ke kolam. Tidak disediakan pengering rambut, tidak ada sabun di kamar mandi. Staf kurang terlatih. Restoran penuh tetapi stafnya acuh tak acuh, kami bahkan menawarkan orang lain untuk duduk di tempat kami karena meja dan kursinya penuh. Staf restoran bernama Awi (ayi)?, tidak yakin, tidak berperilaku seperti pelayan di restoran hotel bintang 5, ketika diberitahu bahwa saus sambalnya habis, dia hanya mengatakan untuk memberi tahu staf yang sedang memasak omelet, apa-apaan ini? Untuk makanan. Hanya omelet dan sosisnya yang enak, yang lainnya biasa saja dan bahkan kurang enak. Kondisi hujan. Payung terpusat di restoran, kebanyakan dari kami kehujanan dalam perjalanan ke restoran, belum lagi payung terbatas sehingga banyak orang bersama keluarga harus melewati hujan tanpa payung. Untuk hotel bintang 5, ini buruk, jangan berharap lebih."

Kami melihat ada tikus di kamar, kami melaporkannya ke resepsionis, tetapi mereka bahkan tidak menawarkan untuk mengganti kamar. Kami mengalami beberapa masalah saat memesan karena bahasa Inggris staf restoran buruk. Tidak memungkinkan untuk berenang di pantai di depan hotel."
"515.","Rassul Badran","1","2018-01-14","1","Kami mengalami pengalaman buruk saat mengunjungi hotel untuk kunjungan sehari. Pertama, tidak memungkinkan untuk berenang di laut karena arus yang kuat dan ombak yang besar. Kedua, makanan dan kualitas layanannya sangat buruk. Steak wagyu grade 5 diminta untuk dimasak medium well, tetapi kami mendapatkan potongan daging yang sangat matang dan hambar. 200 g udang terlalu matang dan disajikan dengan saus pedas dan berbau tidak sedap. Pai jamur puff pastry seperti karet dan tidak terlalu berasa. Seluruh daftar anggur tidak tersedia, kecuali 3 jenis anggur yang salah satunya adalah anggur meja yang agak pahit (Chardonnay Australia). Sejujurnya, sup asparagusnya enak, sup bawangnya lumayan. Kentang goreng dan roti gratis adalah bagian terbaik dari makan siang. Mengenai layanan: butuh waktu lama untuk mendapatkan anggur kami. Staf berbicara sangat keras, membanting piring dan peralatan makan, saat menyiapkan meja di restoran. Butuh waktu sekitar 10 menit untuk membayar tagihan. Makan siang untuk dua orang seharga Rp1.500.000. TIDAK akan merekomendasikan tempat ini, karena tempat ini dinilai terlalu berlebihan oleh pemandu lokal dan staf sendiri."

"550.","EJOHN","10","2026-01-08","2","(Translated by Google) I stayed for two nights from December 30, 2025, to January 1, 2026, and checked out one night early. I'll explain the details: Cons: 1. The hotel building, especially the ceiling, is heavily damaged. 2. The stair handrails are rusty. 3. The corridor handrails look fragile and are dangerous to hold. 4. There are many bird and bee nests, especially in the rooms facing the sea. 5. Many rooms, especially those facing the ocean, are unsuitable for accommodation. 6. The wood around the pool is brittle from the seawater. 7. Lots of worms around the pool. 8. The curtains are dirty and black. 9. There are cockroaches in the room. 10. The hinges on the glass door in the bathroom look like they're about to fall off. 11. The bathtub doesn't work. 12. The refrigerator is broken (but has been replaced). 13. There are many rooms but few guests (do you want to stay in a quiet hotel?) 14. The sink is clogged. 15. The internet is slow. Pros: 1. Friendly and helpful staff at check-in and checkout. 2. Breakfast is quite varied. 3. Beach view despite the big waves. If by the time this article is written and the hotel hasn't made any improvements, I think you should leave and find a better one. But if you just want to stay and enjoy a relaxing time and the beach view without worrying about the shortcomings mentioned above, go ahead. (Original) Saya menginap 2 malam pada tanggal 30 Des 2025 -1 Jan 2026 dan checkout lebih cepat 1 malam. Saya jelaskan detailnya kenapa: Cons: 1.Bangunan Hotel terutama plafon banyak yang rusak 2.Handrail tangga berkarat 3.Handrail koridor terlihat rapuh dan berbahaya untuk di pegang 4.Banyak sarang burung dan lebah terutama di kamar menghadap ke Laut. 5.Banyak kamar terutama menghadap ke laut yang tidak layak inap 6.Kayu-kayu disekitar pool sudah rapuh terkena air laut 7.Banyak ulat disekitar pool 8.Gorden kamar kotor dan hitam 9.Terdapat kecoa dikamar 10.Kondisi engsel pintu kaca di kamar mandi terlihat mau jatuh 11.Bathub tidak berfungsi 12.Kulkas rusak (tapi diganti baru) 13.Jumlah kamar banyak tapi tamu menginap sedikit (apakah anda ingin menginap di hotel yang sepi) 14.Wastafel mampet 15.Internet slow Pros: 1.Staff ramah dan baik waktu checkin dan checkout 2.Sarapan pagi cukup bervariasi (walaupun tidak sebanyak seperti hotel berbintang) 3.Pemandangan pantai tapi ombak cukup besar Apabila sampai tulisan ini dibuat dan belum ada perbaikan dari hotel, saya pikir tinggalkan saja hotel tersebut, dan cari hotel lain yang lebih baik. Tapi apabila anda hanya ingin menginap dan menikmati waktu santai serta pemandangan pantai tanpa memperdulikan hal-hal kekurangan diatas, silahkan."

Waktu saya nginap di sana lebaran tahun ini, kolam renang sedang dalam maintenance, agak butek. Tamu kebanyakan turis lokal dengan membawa keluarga dan anak-anak ada juga turis asing. Kamar bersih tapi handuknya terlihat kusam (tua) jadi ragu2 pakainya. Jauh dari keramaian jadi cocok utk stay cation. Jauh dari resto dan fasilitas lainnya. Makanan di resto kurang cocok di lidah saya yg suka makanan tradisional Indonesia, harga makanan masih rata2 hotel ***. Saya ke sana dengan ikut promosi keanggotaan hotel tersebut, lama mereka presentasi sekitar 90 menit, harga agak murah sih ikut promosi itu cuma ya harus ikut penawaran2 mereka, mulanya sangat ramah dan hangat pembicaraannya, tapi pas terakhir saya gak mau gabung mereka jadi jutek dan agak gak saya suka cara2 nawarin nya, agak gak sopan kata2 dan tindakanya setelah saya tolak. Saya pikir mending cari alternatif lain drpd sakit ati."

Langit-langit yang rusak, yang dilaporkan September 2025 lalu, masih ada (ulasan Google). Liftnya bau dan tombol lantainya tidak menyala, jadi Anda pada dasarnya harus menggunakan 'perasaan' Anda untuk tahu apakah Anda menuju lantai yang benar lol. Semuanya, dari lift hingga lorong, terlihat kumuh. Jelas tidak sepadan dengan harganya. Jangan tanya soal makanannya. Benar-benar standar dan tidak memiliki kualitas bintang 5 sama sekali. Terasa lebih seperti katering hotel bintang 3."
"580.","Nancy Rizkalla","180","2025-11-14","2","Hotelnya sudah tua dan perlu direnovasi. Ada beberapa bagian yang rusak di mana-mana. Kolam renangnya sudah tidak ada ubinnya, langit-langitnya berlubang di mana-mana, dan lantainya tidak ada papan kayunya. Saya sudah meninggalkan catatan di tempat tidur yang menyatakan bahwa saya ingin seprai bersih, tetapi ketika kembali ke kamar, saya menemukan kotoran di selimut putihnya. Jadi, saya tidak menggantinya. Keset kamar mandi di lantai juga tampak kotor. Layar yang memisahkan kamar mandi sangat sulit diturunkan. Sayangnya, ada kecoak di sana. Kami meminta resepsionis untuk memeriksa kamar dan menyemprotnya. Mereka melakukannya, tetapi ada serangga mati di kamar mandi. Balkon dengan bak mandi tampak kotor, jadi kami tidak berani menggunakannya. Jika Anda memesan kamar dengan pemandangan laut, ketahuilah bahwa Anda dapat mendengar suara laut menghantam pantai. Percayalah... suara itu sangat keras. Bagi saya, ini bukan hotel bintang 5. Sejujurnya, kamarnya bagus di dalam, tetapi semuanya terasa lembap."
"581.","洪均楷","726","2025-11-14","2","Kebersihannya buruk; saat memasuki kamar, banyak kotoran yang terlihat di lantai, seprai, dan handuk. Selain itu, karena lokasinya di tepi pantai, kamarnya cukup lembap. Fasilitasnya juga buruk; lemari-lemarinya rusak dan mengeluarkan suara yang cukup keras. Pengering rambutnya lusuh, hampir tidak menghasilkan panas dan aliran udaranya lemah. Selain itu, terdapat kerusakan parah pada atap hotel. Kolam renang tepi pantai yang besar dan indah di foto-foto itu dangkal dan lebih cocok untuk mengapung dan bersantai daripada berenang. Kolam renang yang sebenarnya berbentuk segitiga kecil. Sarapannya biasa saja. Secara keseluruhan, pengalaman menginapnya kurang memuaskan."

"583.","sono","24","2025-11-14","2","Lokasinya bagus. Dekat dengan laut dan matahari terbenamnya indah. Tamannya juga indah. Malam harinya, angin kencang mengguncang tempat itu berkali-kali sampai saya mengira itu gempa bumi, dan itu menakutkan. Ada banyak bantal, tetapi semuanya sangat bau sehingga saya tidak bisa menggunakannya. Karena baunya sangat menyengat, saya meletakkannya di ujung ruangan. Rasanya seperti sudah berhari-hari tidak dicuci, sungguh mengecewakan."
"584.","Travel World wide","1","2025-09-14","2","Saya hanya mengeluh soal sarapan. Tidak, rasa, semua makanannya, Sejak saya memesan di sini sejak 2017, hampir semua bisnis saya, saya memesankan hotel saya untuk Anda, Tapi sejak 2 tahun terakhir, makanan Anda, terutama sarapan, rasanya hambar, Anda tidak punya koki untuk hotel dan restoran berbintang Anda? Kenapa Anda melakukan ini pada restoran dan hotel Anda yang indah? Saya sayang Anda, Tidakkah Anda ingin berubah? Tidak ada waktu untuk mengurusnya, Anda akan kehilangan pelanggan, saya sangat sedih. Pelayanan Anda juga, jadi di resepsionis, harus menggunakan hati Anda, Fokus: Sarapan Anda, tolong ubah, cicipi makanannya Anda menaruhnya, saya tidak tahu harus berkata apa, Pelayanan.. Manajer atau pemimpin, tolong periksa tugas Anda, Terima kasih Katrina"
"585.","Eka Handayani","3","2025-07-14","2","Kebersihannya buruk. Laba-laba ada di mana-mana, di kamar dan lampu restoran. Kualitas fasilitas tidak sesuai standar hotel bintang 5 (berdasarkan Google). Kamar berjamur dan lift tidak berfungsi tanpa pemberitahuan dari hotel. Kolam renang utama ditutup tanpa pemberitahuan dari hotel. Perlu meningkatkan kebersihan, terutama kamar dan restoran. Satu hal yang bagus di hotel ini adalah sikap dan pelatihan staf."
"586.","kuyou ku","64","2025-12-14","2","Hotelnya tua dan berantakan. Bahkan kulkasnya pun tidak berfungsi. Lupakan hotel bintang lima, hotel ini bahkan tidak sebagus hotel bisnis."
"587.","briannon micallef","8","2025-05-14","2","Saya dan pasangan saya telah memesan 3 malam di resor bintang 5 ini dan cukup mengecewakan, kami hanya menginap 1 malam karena kami hanya ingin pergi. Seprai bernoda dan robek. Remote TV tidak berfungsi dan kualitas TV sangat buruk, kulkas mini tidak berfungsi, brankas tidak mudah dioperasikan dan ingin menggunakan kartu bank saya untuk mengoperasikannya? Telepon kamar kami tidak berfungsi dan ketika kami pergi ke meja resepsionis untuk memberi tahu mereka, mereka mengatakan akan ada seseorang yang datang dan memeriksanya tetapi tidak ada yang datang. Kami ingin menggunakan telepon untuk layanan kamar sehingga mereka memberi kami nomor telepon WhatsApp untuk dihubungi tetapi tidak ada jawaban/tanggapan. Sekali lagi kami pergi ke meja resepsionis dan memberi tahu mereka bahwa kami telah menghubungi nomor WhatsApp dan saat itulah kami akhirnya mendapat tanggapan. Layanan kamar yang sama membutuhkan waktu 1,5 jam untuk sampai ke kamar kami. Sedang ada pekerjaan konstruksi yang membuat kolam renang pantai (kolam renang utama) tidak tersedia, dan kami tidak diberitahu saat check-in. Tidak ada sendok di kamar untuk mengaduk kopi/teh. Secara keseluruhan, resor ini tidak tampak seperti resor bintang 5. Kami pernah menginap di resor bintang 3 yang jauh lebih baik. Kelebihannya adalah stafnya sangat ramah dan mereka menyediakan sarapan yang lezat dengan banyak pilihan makanan. Tidak direkomendasikan!"
"588.","Pavel Sokolov (HP Racing)","5","2025-04-14","2","Kami memilih hotel dalam perjalanan ke Sanur. Kami ingin bermalam dan melanjutkan perjalanan di pagi hari. Kami terkesan dengan akses mudah ke jalan raya. Parkir bawah tanahnya memang plus, tapi hanya itu saja. Kamarnya jelas bukan hotel bintang 5. Perlu renovasi, sama seperti seluruh kompleksnya (saya terutama suka rumputnya yang kering. :))) AC di kamar mengeluarkan udara dingin yang menusuk, entah bagaimana caranya. Kami pergi makan malam, bukan untuk makan, melainkan untuk minum segelas anggur setelah perjalanan. Bahkan tidak ada bir di seluruh hotel. Begitulah hotel bintang 5."
"589.","christophe baud","208","2025-06-14","2","Aperitif jauh lebih mahal daripada di tempat lain (50% lebih mahal daripada hotel di Ubud). Tidak ada jubah mandi untuk kolam renang. Kulkas kamar rusak. Perlu renovasi total. Sarapan sudah termasuk dalam harga kamar, tetapi Anda harus membayar ekstra untuk cokelat panas. Dan kemudian ada biaya tambahan. Singkatnya, tidak bagus, untungnya hanya menginap semalam."
"590.","Sander Op 't Hof","84","2025-11-14","2","Resor yang ketinggalan zaman. Perlu renovasi. Bukan resor bintang 5, lebih seperti bintang 3. Dan ada kecoak di kamar!"
"591.","A","21","2025-05-14","2","Sayangnya, pengalaman saya kurang memuaskan. Saya memesan Kamar Superior, tetapi terasa tua dan membosankan, jadi saya harus meningkatkan ke Kamar Deluxe yang sungguh indah! Tempat di luar kamar penuh dengan serangga dan kadal, yang sangat mengganggu. Meskipun pemandangannya menakjubkan, saya tidak bisa menikmati fasilitasnya karena serangga. Saya mengerti hal ini umum di Bali, tetapi setidaknya restorannya harus bersih dan bebas serangga. Hanya ada satu restoran dengan menu yang sangat terbatas, dan karena hotelnya jauh dari keramaian, Anda tidak punya pilihan selain makan di sana hampir sepanjang waktu. Kamar saya memiliki balkon, tetapi saya tidak bisa menikmatinya semenit pun karena kadal-kadal itu. Ada empat kadal yang tinggal di balkon saya, dan saya harus menutup pintu sepanjang waktu untuk memastikan mereka tidak masuk ke kamar!!! Saya juga ingin mencoba spa, tetapi baunya tidak sedap, jadi saya membatalkan janji pijat saya. Kelebihan: • Pemandangan laut yang indah • Suara alam terdengar di mana-mana • Staf yang sangat ramah, profesional, dan responsif • Tenang dan damai (sempurna untuk bersantai) • Makanan di restorannya enak, meskipun menunya terbatas Keseluruhan: Saya hanya merekomendasikan tempat ini jika Anda tidak masalah dengan serangga dan kadal yang sangat besar!! Jika tidak, tempat ini tidak cocok untuk Anda."
"592.","Putu Andika","3","2025-01-14","2","Ulasan Positif: Staf keamanan sangat ramah dan membantu selama proses bongkar muat, mengarahkan parkir, dan bahkan turun ke ruang bawah tanah untuk memastikan tersedianya tempat parkir. Staf saat sarapan sangat ramah, membuat kami merasa diterima dengan baik. Kamar bersih, AC dingin, dan semuanya berfungsi dengan baik. Taman terawat baik dan rapi. Ulasan Negatif: Saya check-in pukul 13.00, dan meskipun ada sekitar 6 atau 7 orang di resepsionis, tidak ada yang mendekati istri saya untuk membantu membawakan bagasi. Selama proses check-in, saya ditangani oleh seorang trainee (yang tidak saya pedulikan), tetapi reservasi saya tidak dapat ditemukan. Akhirnya, seorang staf wanita (Puri atau Putri, berkacamata) mengambil alih, tetapi reservasi tetap tidak dapat ditemukan. Meskipun telah mengonfirmasi reservasi, mereka tidak dapat menemukannya. Kartu identitas saya sudah diambil, dan staf wanita tersebut sangat tidak ramah dan tidak membantu, membuat saya merasa distereotipkan sebagai orang Bali lokal. Mereka seharusnya belajar tentang keramahan dari staf keamanan. Staf makan malamnya juga tidak ramah. Ketika anak saya memesan spageti bakso (dari menu anak-anak), mereka menawarkan pilihan vegan atau reguler. Ketika saya bertanya apa arti vegan, staf tersebut membenarkan bahwa menu anak-anak hanya menyediakan pilihan reguler, menunjukkan kurangnya pengetahuan produk. Ketika istri saya bertanya apakah ayam bakarnya sudah termasuk nasi, staf tersebut malah menyuruhnya untuk memeriksa deskripsi di menu (sangat tidak profesional). Lebih parah lagi, staf prianya juga tidak ramah terhadap kami, warga lokal. Ketika tamu asing datang, mereka disambut dengan hangat dan diperlakukan berbeda. Yang paling parah adalah ketika saya memesan 2 Coca-Cola, tetapi setelah membayar, kami baru tahu bahwa kami dikenakan biaya untuk 4. Apakah mereka mencoba mencuri dari kami? Kami harus menunggu lagi untuk mendapatkan pengembalian uang. Hotel fisiknya sangat bagus, tetapi kami tidak mendapatkan pengalaman yang kami harapkan. Hanya petugas keamanan dan para wanita yang membawa sesajen yang menyambut kami ketika kami lewat."
"593.","Laura Strada","18","2025-01-14","2","Hotel ini dulu bagus, tapi sekarang terbengkalai. Mirip seperti hotel di film The Shining. Tamunya sangat sedikit, kedua kolam renang rusak, banyak jamur dan kerak kapur, dan yang terpenting, alarm kebakaran berbunyi sangat keras pukul 3.20 pagi, menandakan adanya kebakaran. Suasananya sangat mengerikan, dan kami tidak bisa tidur lagi. Tidak ada apa-apa di area ini. JANGAN TINGGAL DI SANA. Kalau cuma mampir semalam, mungkin lumayan. Kamarnya luas dan bersih, ada Wi-Fi. Restorannya bagus, dan sarapannya lumayan. Tapi mintalah kamar di lantai dasar, jadi setidaknya Anda tidak akan takut kalau alarm berbunyi. Jangan habiskan lebih dari $50 per malam untuk kamar double."
"594.","Ali Wafdi","95","2024-01-14","2","Alasan saya memberi hotel ini 2 bintang adalah karena stafnya, kalau tidak, saya akan memberinya 0 bintang. Semua orang di hotel sangat ramah dan membantu. Kami harus check out pukul 3 pagi, ketika saya mencoba memesan Grab, tidak ada pengemudi. Pria di meja depan memanggil taksi hotel dan kami berhasil tiba tepat waktu. Hotel ini sangat jauh dari mana-mana, tidak ada restoran atau kafe di area tersebut, kami harus naik Grab selama lebih dari +1 jam untuk sampai ke tempat-tempat yang bagus. Makanan di restoran hotel jauh di bawah rata-rata. Kamarnya lumayan, tetapi ada infestasi semut. Mereka masuk ke camilan kami dan menggigit kami di tempat tidur pada malam hari. Kolam renang sangat kotor dan membuat Anda tidak ingin berenang. Ada banyak anjing liar di sekitar kolam renang dan mereka bisa menghampiri Anda, jadi kami tidak bisa tinggal di sana bersama balita kami. Selain itu, hotel ini tidak ramah kereta dorong, Anda tidak bisa mendorong kereta dorong Anda untuk pergi ke restoran atau pantai. Pantainya tidak dapat digunakan, tetapi bagus jika Anda ingin bersantai di depannya."
"595.","Suzanne Kroksdotter","28","2025-01-14","2","Hotel yang indah, lokasinya jauh dari hampir semua tempat. Kamarnya berukuran bagus, tetapi interiornya agak usang dan kurang bersih. Yang paling menakutkan adalah gedungnya bergetar dan kami semua sangat ketakutan. Stafnya sangat ramah, tetapi sangat tidak terorganisir dan kurang terlatih, terutama di restoran. Kalau saya yang jadi stafnya, saya akan mengajari mereka cara bersikap di hadapan tamu dan mengajari mereka bahasa Inggris. Pijatnya buruk sekali, saya pergi sebelum selesai. Tidak ada sabun di toilet restoran. Lain kali kami akan memilih hotel lain."
