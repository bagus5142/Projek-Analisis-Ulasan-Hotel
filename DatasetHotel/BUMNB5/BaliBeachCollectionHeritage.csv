"1.","Ian B","2","2025-12-24","5","We selected the newly revitalised Bali Beach Hotel for our family getaway in December, and it proved to be an inspired choice. The restoration of this icon is truly impressive, the hardware exudes a sense of grandeur, and the location in Sanur is simply unbeatable. The Olympic-sized pool and the engaging Kids Club were absolute highlights for my son, providing endless entertainment. We also delighted in the two on-site dining venues and took full advantage of the generous 1-for-1 promotion at the spa, which was a wonderful touch for in-house guests. Our room was a sanctuary of modern luxury, boasting excellent design and build quality. The view from the balcony was, in a word, priceless—a breathtaking panorama that I understand graces every room in the hotel. That said, there were two minor details that I felt did not quite align with the otherwise opulent standards of the property: the refrigerator struggled to maintain a cool temperature, and the bath linens felt slightly past their prime. Aside from these small points of feedback, the accommodation was superb. However, what truly sets this hotel apart is its software—the service. The hospitality we received was nothing short of flawless, epitomized by Mr. Eka Subawa. He became far more than a staff member to us; he was our unofficial, personalized concierge, ensuring our stay was perfect even on his days off. His level of care, dedication, and genuine warmth is a rare find and truly priceless. Finally, the location is perfection. The beachfront promenade offers a vibrant array of activities and dining options should you wish to venture out. It strikes a magnificent balance; avoiding the manic energy of Kuta and the pretension of Canggu. Sanur, and specifically the Bali Beach Hotel, offers the perfect equilibrium for anyone seeking the very best of Bali."

Excellent service, comfortable rooms, and a great view. Huge clean swimming pool and a very usable gym compared to typical hotels. Very close to the Bali Beach Convention Center and with easy access to the beachside street walk, but just far enough from the nearby restaurants to be very quiet and pleasant. The breakfast buffet had a satisfactory variety of well-prepared local and international dishes. All for a price that is much cheaper than what I am used to in other countries. Definitely worthy of consideration for a leisurely stress-free vacation."
"3.","Lylac","8","2025-12-24","5","Overall, the hotel had a calm, cozy atmosphere and all the staff were very kind, so we really enjoyed our stay. The breakfast was a bit disappointing, to be honest… but everything else made up for it. What stood out the most was the kids club — our children absolutely loved it. They had such a great time that even now they keep asking for Miss Astri , Ayu, desak and laksmi 🥹 We’re staying at a different hotel right now, but they keep saying they want to go back to Bali Beach Hotel, haha. Thank you so much for taking such great care of our kids. We truly appreciate it! 💛"

We've spent the last 5days at The Meru Sanur and then transferred to the sister hotel The Bali Beach Hotel for a further 5days...we have absolutely loved our stay at both these stylish, well located hotels, there are many fabulous restaurants and cafes and the lcon mall within walking distance. The pool, fitness centre as well as the breakfast are all amazing. The service at both hotels has been superb and a particular mention and shout out to Aris who has gone above and beyond in making our experience particularly memorable...thank you Aris, you are a valuable member of staff at this hotel!"
"5.","Philip Connor","127","2025-12-01","5","The Perfect stay, absolutely love this hotel. The breakfast selections were true 5 star you could not wish for more. Rooms spacious, clean, nice balcony superb views. The pool is the best in Sanur we have stayed at most 5 star hotels, this pool beats all, especially appreciate the cool water temperature. The architectural features of this hotel are truly splendid. Our most memorable experience was of course the Balinese hotel staff, incredibly helpful and friendly. The path from the hotel to Bali Icon shopping Mall is an easy 10minute walk. We loved our stay at Bali Beach Hotel, highly recommended."
"6.","Jelena M","13","2025-12-01","5","The hotel is absolutely beautiful and exceptionally clean, with every detail carefully designed. The food is very diverse and delicious – truly worth praising! The staff are incredibly kind, always smiling, and available to respond to any request in no time. Altogether, it makes the stay extremely pleasant and relaxing. Highly recommended 🫶🏼"
"7.","Selin S","9","2025-12-10","5","Amazing location, lovely staff gorgeous hotel! Try to avoid seafood grill restaurant on beach as there is not fresh seafood and sister got sick. But the rest of the stay was lovely. Amazing beach view and the beach is crystal clear! Breakfast buffet was lovely and we got complimentary 5 course dinner with famous chef."
"8.","Karen O'Keefe","18","2025-10-01","5","I stayed at this hotel many years ago and the renovation has breathed new life into a classic older Bali Hotel. The rooms are very nicely decorated and the bed is very, very comfortable but above all that the service is incredible. The staff were lovely, helpful and are some of the best I have experienced. The breakfast range and variety is amazing. I also had a massage and, whilst it on the more expensive side, it was well worth it. The spa surroundings and room are very relaxing and Meli, my massage therapist was excellent. Hope to return often here and can I recommend it highly enough."
"9.","Boyke Aveanto","6","2025-12-24","5","Great hotel ! Service is a bit too much, staff are too attentive thus making my privacy a bit disruptive. Staff are not able to let guest sit alone in peace but keep asking standard unimportant question such as how is your stay, anything I can help. This leads to too much attention but less peaceful enjoyment of the hotel !"
"10.","Angelia Ayu Setiadewi","11","2025-12-01","5","Saya sempat nge-gym selama kurang lebih 1 jam di Bali Beach Hotel Sanur tempat saya menginap, dan pengalaman saya cukup menyenankan. Tempat gym-nya bersih, nyaman, dan alat-alat gym-nya juga terbaru, jadi enak banget buat latihan. Yang jaga di sana juga sangat ramah, ada Ka Yoga yang siap membantu. Dia baik banget, tidak hanya menjawab pertanyaan saya, tapi juga memberikan tips dan panduan untuk latihan glutes yang benar. Secara keseluruhan, suasana di gym sangat mendukung untuk berolahraga, dan saya merasa puas dengan fasilitas yang tersedia. Menginap di hotel ini juga sangat nyaman, dekat dengan pantai, jadi setelah gym bisa langsung menikmati suasana santai di sekitar hotel."

Hotelnya juga luaassshh... Dpt compliment sepeda gratis 1 jam. Meeting room juga cakep, view pantai. Mau kuliner tradisional ada makbeng n nasi campur. Mau yg modern ke bali icon jg deket."
"12.","C W","80","2025-10-01","5","We had a group of 39 (Travel Divas) and our check in process went very smoothly. The service is AMAZING at this hotel, you want for nothing. Everyone and I do mean everyone was professional and pleasant. What I noticed and appreciated was that staff greeted me regularly with their hello gesture (hand across heart like you’re doing the pledge). Absolutely, memorable trip and time at this hotel. Highly recommend staying here if you like luxury and being catered to ‼️"
"13.","MsDhee21","39","2025-12-01","5","Pertama datang cari2 lobi, ternyata lobinya di bawah harus lewat lorong ke bawah. Dari lobi ke lift kamar lumayan jauh. Tapi suasana hotel nyaman sekali, anak2 senang. Bisa sewa sepeda free 1 jam bisa jalan Jann repo pantai Sanur. Ada playground indoor juga yg nyaman"
"14.","Rena Febriani","40","2025-10-31","5","Terakhir ke Bali beach dulu banget sebelum ada renovasi, klo sekarang jadi bagus banget gedungnya, halamannya luas pake banget. Tapi biaya parkir motor menurutku lumayan mahal ya, jalan masuk dari arah Bali hospital sangat amat membingungkan. Mending lewat pantai sanur 1 (arah utara). Btw aku ke sini karena dapet job megambel untuk pertemuan CityNet Asia-Pasifik. Jadi no komen untuk kamar krn gak nginep hehe"
"15.","T B","32","2025-10-31","4","We have stayed here the second time in 10 months. It's nice if you can get a room for around 160$ us. I would not like to pay more. Breakfast is nice and the hotel has everything. Seaview is great the rooms are dark timber fitted it is not very appealing and both of the pools are very shallow and way to warm."
"16.","COK PUTRA","3","2025-12-10","5","Jangan ditanya soal service sangat memuaskan, terutama kids club inside the hotel sangat banyak akan adanya aktivitas untuk anak setiap harinya dari pagi sampe sore, teruntuk ms ayu, dan ms astri dan semua staff kids club thank you for taking care wide and ojus they said thank you soo much ms"
"17.","Nadia Krisanti Tjahjana Weda","57","2025-07-31","5","The BEST hotel we ever stayed in Bali! Right from the reception, everything was perfect. The staff are very welcoming and polite. The architecture of this hotel is definitely a showstopper. And the beach... Wow! This is the main reason we stayed there. They have personnel specially designated to maintain the beach at the back of their property, which is not a thing you usually find even in a 5-star beachfront hotel. It's very clean and not too crowded, even though it's a public beach. The pool is also massive, very enjoyable to swim in, or simply just chilling. As for the room, it's modern and spacious with great amenities. And the breakfast is awesome too, worth every penny you paid for it. Compared to the other beachfront hotels in Bali with the same price point, I think Bali Beach Hotel exceeds our expectations. We'll choose Bali Beach Hotel again for sure the next time we go to Bali."
"18.","Jae Kyoun Kim","5","2025-12-01","5","We loved to stay at Bali beach! All so nice! But definitely the kids club made our holiday so happy and relaxing! We were with two kids, 7 and 9 years old boy and girl. They really love to play at the kids club. I and my wife could have long breakfast while kids played at the kids club. Thank you so much for your warm welcome and patience! They were real professional teachers! Thank you so much, Ms. Laksmi and Ms Astri, Ms. Desak! :) We will miss you!"
"19.","Rizky Ismail","14","2025-12-01","1","tidak memghargai ojol satpamnya,udah dilobby mau titip aja orderan malah ngerjain parkir dijauhkan suruh jalan kaki kelobbynya.pdhl udah dimuka lobby..tidak manusiawi"
"20.","Soo-Ah Youn","19","2025-08-31","5","Had an amazing stay at the the Bali Beach Hotel (Sanur)! The hotel and rooms were absolutely stunning and the breakfast buffet was excellent! The staff were extremely welcoming and professional. Plus the security felt top-notch and we felt very safe the entire time. One minor complaint would be the speed of service - one night we had ordered take out and it took 25mins for someone to bring it to the room (at which point we went down to get it ourselves but someone was already on their way). Also to level set expectations, just because its 5-stars doesn't mean no bugs!!! There was a cluster of 30 tiny spiders who tried to get to our take out containers. Key point, maybe avoid ordering take out!"
"21.","S L","143","2025-07-01","5","Exceptional Stay – Warm Hospitality & Wonderful Comfort What an incredible experience staying at Bali Beach Hotel! From the moment we stepped in, we were warmly greeted by the entire team every staff member displayed genuine hospitality, professionalism, and kindness. Their smiles and friendly attitude truly made our stay special. The entire journey was seamless and relaxing. Our room was exactly what we hoped for clean, spacious, and incredibly comfortable, with thoughtful touches that made us feel right at home. The bed was plush, the lighting calming, and the balcony view was a dream. Breakfast was a standout so many choices, all beautifully presented and delicious. From fresh pastries to local favourites, there was something for everyone. The amenities were top-notch, and we absolutely loved the pool it was beautifully maintained and even heated, which made evening swims extra enjoyable. What really sets this hotel apart, though, is the staff. Their attentiveness, warmth, and sincere smiles made all the difference. We’ll absolutely return not just for the luxurious setting, but because of the people who made us feel so welcome. Thank you, Bali Beach Hotel - Sanur, for a truly memorable stay!"
"22.","I.J. (Rocket Tradeline)","188","2025-07-01","5","Highly recommend. Absolutely stunning architecture, sculptures, and lighting design throughout. I had a perfect view of the ocean from my room. The facility is top notch. The pool is massive and great to swim in. Amazing service and lovely breakfast. They offer a free yoga class every month if At 7 AM which I went to every day. I loved my stay here so much that I extended another two nights. Direct access to the beach and the area is calm and serene with access to several restaurants, massages, mall, shopping, and other amenities."
"23.","Yvette Soewanto","3","2025-10-31","5","Had lunch in Roso Restaurant, we chose the Halmahera lunch set, and Timbungan. The food was all exceptional in taste and plating. The service by Mas Ajus was also outstanding, very kind and warm. The newly renovated restaurant interior was also well designed, with a warm touch of wood"
"24.","reggie kurniawan","780","2025-07-31","4","Excellent on hard products, but fail on the soft ones. The hotel management should have a contingency plan in every department during the peak season so that the staff not just gave a warm gesture and sincere smiles without knowing what guests needed most, but knew how to give excellent services while the hotel was fully booked. One most important tip is for guests who want to have a good rest please avoid booking corner suite room located exactly above the roso restaurant because the noisy dragging chairs and tables from restaurant will be heard into the room especially around 10 pm and 7 am in the morning. Overall, i couldn't say it was a fantastic stay due to the poor and slow services that were given during our stay."
"25.","Chris March","6","2025-08-31","5","We absolutely loved our stay here. Outstanding facility, amazing service, in a great location. Sanur beachfront promenade is very laid back. Close to great restaurants and Icon Bali (if you like western style shopping). We highly recommend this hotel."
"26.","Sheheryar Shafique","5","2025-08-31","5","Stayed at Bali Beach Hotel for a conference and had a pleasant experience. Beautiful beachfront location with relaxing views and a grand design. Staff were friendly and helpful, and the breakfast had good variety. It was a comfortable and enjoyable stay."
"27.","Tania Morris","5","2025-08-31","5","Absolutely loved my stay in Sanur. Stayed at many different locations over 40years in Bali and my 1st in Sanur. Highly rate this hotel!!! The staff are absolutely beautiful!! I did feel the staff were run off their feet around the pool so perhaps a good idea to employ a few more for the pool service. Will definitely be back!"
"28.","Sarah North","269","2025-08-31","3","Pros: • Stayed in room 2737. August 2025. • Large rooms • Good range at breakfast • Nicely located along beach • Stunning views • Efficient room service • Has an amazing foyer which is impressive from an architectural perspective • Staff friendly • Really well equipped gym • Good kids club Cons: • The place has around 260 rooms so is quite large • Bathroom a bit tight with little room between toilet and sink. • Food in Restaurants overpriced • Some staff had very poor English • We were charged on our final account extra fees for drinks from the pool bar that we did not consume and had no knowledge of. At checkout we had an incompetent staff member who was sick and kept coughing on us without covering his mouth, who said he'd remove the additional charge and printed a new account. We thought it was sorted. Then, when our taxi arrived to collect us we were accosted by another staff member who told us we still had to pay IDR150k for the pool bar charges! We again disputed this and after 10 mins of back and forth we were able to leave. What a saga and terrible end to our stay! So rude of these staff to chase us down for charges that had nothing to do with us! - Pool large but needs about 100 more sunbeds as they are all taken by 8am each day so we were unable to use the pool. - lifts slow and not enough of them"

"35.","Randy Carlos","187","2025-07-31","4","Hotel nya sangat bagus terutama arsitektur di lobi. Lingkungan sekitar hotel juga asri. Kamar hotelnya nyaman dan bersih. Lokasinya strategis, ada pruvate beach nya. Pelayanan nya juga excellent selama menginap, semua petugasnya ramah dan helpful. Mungkin yang agak kurang adalah lamanya proses check in padahal saya sudah sampai jam 14.30 tapi proses cek in nya lumayan lama. Saya menunggu kurang lebih 30-40 menitan baru mendapatkan kunci akses ke kamarn"
"36.","Lisa Carnival","11","2025-07-31","5","This is an old hotel that now presents a fresh new look after renovation. The lobby is luxurious and grand. The arrangement of Balinese goddesses along the entrance hallway creates a unique and elegant interior. The room is quite spacious and comfortable. The breakfast menu is varied, but the taste is rather disappointing. The best part of this hotel is that all rooms face the beach. Sanur, known for its calm and clean beach, creates a very pleasant stay atmosphere. The hotel landscape is fairly large and well-maintained. In my opinion, for a five-star hotel, its main shortcoming is the lack of facilities. Only the sunrise yoga is free—other activities come at an additional cost. There are also no performances such as Balinese dance, gamelan music, or other cultural shows that are typically offered in five-star hotels. Along the beach, there are many charming cafés, restaurants, local shops, bars, and more—all within walking distance. One of the hotel’s standout qualities is its friendly staff, who are always greeting and helpful. They do not discriminate between local and foreign tourists. As a local tourist, I find this a major plus, especially since many places in Bali tend to prioritize foreign guests and overlook locals. Good job, Bali Beach Hotel!"
"37.","Ryan Kim","989","2025-07-01","5","Recently stayed at Bali Beach Hotel in Sanur and was pleasantly surprised. The property blends historic charm with modern updates, offering a clean, well-maintained space right next to the beach. The rooms are spacious, many with beautiful ocean views, and the location is perfect for morning walks along the beachfront path. Buffet breakfast was generous and tasty, with a decent variety. Staff were friendly and attentive throughout our stay. The overall vibe is peaceful and relaxed — great for those looking to unwind away from the more crowded parts of Bali. Would recommend for travelers who appreciate a quieter, more classic Bali experience with updated comfort."
"38.","Turah Nata","239","2025-10-31","5","Just come for attending an event. Such a huge ballroom with smiley and warm team. However, with 5 start tittle, their coffee break should be better. The 'jajanan pasar' were quite disappointing for 5 star hotel."
"39.","Zois Oiconomou","20","2025-07-31","5","One of the most impressive hotels I've ever stayed in, certainly something to remember. Architecture is amazing, the overall vibe is luxurious without being the usual Instagram-superficial-Bali style. It's a very big facility so don't expect service to be as attentive as it would be in a butique hotel, but overall exceeds expectations. Definitely value for money for Sanur."
"40.","Mia Febriany","87","2025-12-01","5","I usually give a 5-star to any hotel with 24-hour room service 😅 but this one genuinely left an impression. From the moment I checked in until the moment I left, the whole experience just felt consistently good."
"41.","Benjamin Leong Tack Khang","17","2025-12-01","5","I wanted to take the opportunity to give some credits to the reception, especially to Ms Arlina, ms Yupi and Ms Nacha, you guys done a tremendous work to assure your guests are being pampered, please give them a raise!"

Dan saya gak tau kenapa di hotel ini memiliki 2 jalur lobby. Ini cukup aneh sampai saya berjalan ke lobby sebelahnya yang lumayan nguras tenaga juga. Apa kayak gini pelayanan kalian?! Kok bisa kalian merekrut anggota satpam atau security yang malah bekerja? Apa karna udh gajian kalian berleha² sama melayani tamu?."

"46.","celin safira","83","2025-07-01","5","Stayed at Bali Beach Hotel recently and wow – such a throwback to my childhood! I used to come here years ago, and now it’s been totally renovated. It looks amazing – modern, fresh, but still has that old-school charm. The service was flawless – super friendly and professional, like they’ve really leveled up. So cool to see this place come back to life in such a great way. Loved it!"
"47.","Adelina ABV Publishing (ABV publishing)","13","2025-12-01","5","One of my new favorite places to stay! Exceptional rooms, service, food, and activities! Loved every single minute of our stay there ❤️"
"48.","Shubham Gupta","486","2025-08-31","5","Great location, superb vibe. Stay here for slow vacation on the beach side resort. Came here for a meeting and they have a huge meeting hall. Food is good and so is the service."
"49.","Zeneth Thobarony","55","2025-08-31","5","I don’t know how to say but this hotel is spectacular! Look at the location, directly beside the beach. I love Sanur Area because near the Denpasar city where I can find lots of halal restaurants and stall. The location near the Icon Walk Mall. Just by walking, you can easily reach the mall and passing through various local stall. This hotel newly renovated (2024). It live its reputation as historic hotel (built in 1966) as Japan gift. The facade still intact, Japanese minimalism clean sheet. The interior way beyond expectation, with the minimalism concept itself. Room which remembering me to Ryokan House in Japan, using dark brown wood tone and several Indonesian hint (simple ornament and rotan furniture). The service is exquisite as well. Big pool. The hotel lobby and reception is sooo surrealist and mystify me."

"51.","Harry Jay","38","2025-05-31","3","I left a 5-star review for a stay at Uluwatu and wish I could do the same here, but - 1. Lifts are the slowest I've ever come across - 1 star. 2. Room was nice with a great view but you don't have to look hard to find that it has tired somewhat already - 4 stars 3. Bathroom had a sewage smell at times and mould in the corners of the shower - 2 stars. 4. Staff were great - 5 stars 5. Check-in is somewhat laborious but that shouldn't be a huge criticism, as the lead in to the reception area is phenomenal and I was served a great drink upon arrival - 4,5 stars 6. Outdoor restaurant was great - 5 stars based on what I had. 7. Buffet breakfast - Disappointing - 3 stars"

"55.","Fanny Meisiany","49","2025-07-01","4","Pengalaman menginap di Bali Beach Hotel Sanur saya menyenangkan walau ada sedikit kekurangan yg mungkin bisa dipertimbangkan pihak hotel. •Jam checkin saya cukup telat yaitu 15.20 baru tersedia kamarnya , namun diberikan kompensasi dengan diperbolehkan menikmati area lounge nya. Terima kasih itu sangat kami hargai. •Area Pickup & Drop nya memang tersedia vallet parking. Namun tidak tersedia kursi tamu utk menunggu mobilnya ketika diambil. Jadi saya & beberapa tamu lain harus duduk di anak tangga saat menunggu. Selebihnya yg saya rasakan selama staycation di Bali Beach Hotel Sanur adalag menyenangkan . Anak saya pun suka sekali dengan kids club & Kolam renangnya. Kolam yg begitu luas & ramah anak2 sehingga kami puas berenang tidak berdesakan dengan tamu lain.😊 Dan kebetulan hari tersebut ulang tahun saya. Pihak hotel mendekor kamar saya & memberikan kue ulang tahun. Diberikan juga baby crib karena saya bawa bayi. Kamar dengan view sunrise . Sangat indah. 🙏 Terima Kasih Banyak Bali Beach Hotel atas pengalaman yg menyenangkan. Semoga bisa kembali kesana lagi."
"56.","Mr. Cheema","22","2025-05-01","5","One word; PERFECTION Look no further, this hotel is absolutely amazing. Kindest staff, recently renovated and super clean. Absolutely delicious and extensive breakfast, quick beach access, clean rooms with comfortable beds, fast room service to name a few positives. If I have to put it under the microscope then perhaps their elevators could be a bit faster/better programmed. 10/10 place, will most certainly return."
"57.","Hanabear","4","2025-05-31","5","Outstanding Experience – Highly Recommended! From the moment we arrived, the customer service was exceptional. The staff went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. The swimming pool is massive and perfect for relaxing, and the seaview from our room was simply breathtaking. The facilities are even better than what you see in the photos – everything was spotless and beautifully maintained. A special thank you to Duty Manager Alit, who was incredibly helpful and resolved a money exchange fraud issue we encountered in Sanur without any hesitation. Truly impressed by the hospitality and support. We’ll definitely be visiting again!"
"58.","DB K","11","2025-05-01","5","Incredible entrance. Perfect place to stay in Sanur. Could choose to stay nestled away or go down the beach to interact with shops, malls, and great restaurants. In house food especially the breakfast buffet was delicious. Rooms clean. Beautiful sunrise views. Service always helpful. Loved the large uncomplicated swimming pool lounge chair set up. Gym was totally adequate, always clean, would have loved a leg press but can't have everything : ))."
"59.","Aino Christiansen","31","2025-05-31","5","Absolutely loved our stay here. Perfect place to get down in gear. I would come back based on the breakfast alone. Lots of options both regarding food and drinks. Still thinking about. A huge newly renovated pool area was also very wonderful. I enjoyed a free yoga class one morning which was perfect."
"60.","V Griswald","34","2025-05-31","3","Maybe our expectations were too high and based on the reviews of others perhaps I am being too harsh but unfortunately our experience was not that of a 5 star hotel. Check in was too long and unnecessarily procedural and we felt like we were waiting around too long. The room was lovely and the view amazing especially waking up to the sunrise and the sound of the waves. The pool is nice however access could be challenging for those with reduced mobility. There is no shade in the pool until the afternoon. There are not enough day beds for the amount of guests. This is also the case for the day beds on the beach. They seemed forgotten and very old. There isn’t anywhere beachside to chill out or just relax. The lounge area is unused as there is no view of the beach. Some comfortable lounge chairs would be a benefit to the beachside. We had to go to other venues to spend the day relaxing and enjoying food which was fine by us. There are three lifts (the slowest I have ever been on) and when one was being maintained we waited nearly 15mins for a lift. Walking along the foreshore at night was also challenging with the path lights being out and no security. Having to pass by the old abandoned hotel next door and being harassed by young louts was not an enjoyable experience. We only ordered food once from the pool area and were so disappointed with it we chose to eat elsewhere for the remainder of our stay. We mentioned our issues with the food and the drinks were replaced but they were no better. Sadly what should have been a special treat was a disappointment. The hotels focus is on style and not function."
"61.","Haikal","19","2025-05-01","5","WOW!!! Tidak menyangka akan sepuas ini di Bali Beach Hotel Sanur setelah renovasi hotelnya! Ini kunjungan saya kedua ke sini, tapi yang pertama setelah direnovasi dan berganti nama, dan sangat impressed!!! 7 tahun lalu saya berkunjung ke sini masih Inna Grand Bali Beach kalau tidak salah namanya, dan mohon maaf sekali sudah terasa tua dan kurang perawatan. Tetapi setelah dibuka lagi dengan nama baru pasca renovasi namanya Bali Beach Hotel, wow pengalaman saya sangat memuaskan! Bangunan gedungnya masih sama, yaitu bangunan paling besar dan tinggi di Bali. Tetapi setelah renovasi dan touch up sana dan sini, tidak terasa bahwa bangunan ini adalah bangunan yang sudah lama. Kamar sangat lega, kasur, sofa, kursi, semua nyaman. Kamar mandi juga sangat bagus, kayaknya sudah tidak ada sisa dari hotel lamanya di kamar mandi. Balkon kamar wowww langsung menatap laut dan Pulau Penida di seberang sana. Menyejukkan mata sekali dan setiap pagi disambut matahari terbit yang sangat indah. Fasilitas hotel untuk breakfast sudah cukup komplit, pelayanan sangat ramah. Kami selalu dapat duduk walaupun kami ke sana saat peak season libur Lebaran. Kolam renang sangaaaaat luas, dan kami suka karena terdapat berbagai tingkat kedalaman yang jadi anak kami (2.5 tahun) bisa menikmati kolam renangnya juga. Pantai sangat terawat dan cukup bersih. Seperti pantai di Sanur lainnya, memang sangat terasa pasang surutnya ya. Karena namanya juga punya pemerintah dan hotel paling pertama di Bali, wah tamannya luas-luas sekali. Kami juga dapat complimentary photoshoot yang kami gunakan untuk foto keluarga bersama keluarga mertua dan istri serta mertua saya juga dapat complimentary massage. Ketika tiba di hotel, sangat wow dengan tempat drop off lalu jalan ke lorong lalu baru ke area reception yang sangat lapang, ditemani banyak instalasi air mancur dan kolam beserta patung-patung yang sangat unik. Luar biasa di luar ekspektasi saya benar-benar. Bahkan untuk sore jelang malamnya setiap kamar ada turn down servicenya! Bukan sesuatu yang saya expect di hotel price range segini ya. Mantap! Menurut saya ini hotel patut diacungi jempol! Semoga bukan karena efek baru buka dan renovasi, tapi kualitasnya bisa terus dilanjutkan ke depannya supaya hotel ini terus semakin ramai dan dikenal. Untuk entry-level 5 star hotel ini sangat worth it, dengan harganya pas peak season Lebaran kemarin saya dapat harga 2Jt-an per malam, jelas ini opsi sangat bagus dibandingkan sama hotel-hotel 5 stars lainnya di Bali (bukan yang luxury tapi ya). Bahkan dibandingkan sama yang 4 stars tapi branded aja ini harganya masih bersaing, tapi dapat fasilitas dan pelayanan yang sangat baik. Sangat cocok untuk keluarga dan yang ingin menjauhi hiruk pikuk Bali sisi barat dan jadi lompat ke sisi timur ke Sanur :)."

One of the best parts of the stay was the stunning view from the room—waking up to the sound of waves was incredibly soothing. The environment is elegant and impeccably clean, creating a very peaceful and luxurious atmosphere. The hotel also has a well-equipped gym, perfect for those who like to keep up with their workouts while traveling. Another highlight was the exceptional service—the staff are not just polite but genuinely warm and welcoming, making the entire experience even more enjoyable. Breakfast was a delight, with a great variety of delicious options to choose from. In the evening, the beachfront restaurant was the perfect place to unwind, offering high-quality seafood with rich flavors that made for a memorable dining experience. Overall, this hotel offers a perfect mix of comfort, elegance, and top-notch service—definitely a place I’d love to visit again!"
"63.","ROV M","17","2025-05-31","5","Loved our overnight stay at Bali Beach Hotel, the entrance is impressive on arrival especially at night. Unfortunately the bar and restaurants close up around 10pm so could only have room service (only beers no cocktails). Food was delicious & included buffet breakfast amazing!! Staff incredibly friendly, cannot fault service here. Balcony view of the sunrise, beach & Mt Agung is stunning. Beautifully designed hotel, foyer is vast & just WOW!"

The staff always greet you with smiles and the breakfast was amazing! We stayed 4 nights, and each day there is something change in their options. We had lunch at Arunika, always impressed, good price, great food, great vibes. And the kids club! Desak was really nice and bubbly, my 5 year old daughter loved her energy and keep asking to visit kids club everyday."
"72.","Andre Aprillano","46","2025-07-31","4","For me, I think this hotel got the Best Breakfast in Bali so Far in terms of Taste and Variations. We stayed in Sanur Suite for 2 nights. Roomwise is nice but the wooden flooring creaked badly everytime you step on it makes us difficult to have a good rest everytime my children walk on it. Pool water is rather cold and murky not crystal clear. Service is BEST , Thank you for your hospitality. The hotel has Beach access."
"73.","Emina Ohranovic","15","2025-05-31","5","Wonderful hotel with very friendly staff. Very nice hotel design, everything looks very spacious. We had breakfast included which was okay. The pool is large and clean.The beach is right across from the hotel, which is great. The location is perhaps a little further from all the happenings, approximately 15 min. I would come again!"

Service was fantastic and the staff were lovely and always happy to help and smiley. The pool was spacious as well as the rooms. The only thing was the location but that was perfect because it was further away from the very busy tourist areas. Still touristy area but the staff are well versed and knowledgeable of the area and where to go and where to avoid."
"77.","Amanda Maynard","11","2025-03-31","4","Stayed here for 9 nights recently. The hotel is beautiful and newly renovated. The beach and grounds are immaculate. The pool is really nice, warm and perfect for kids. Staff and service are amazing. The breakfast buffet is really good with a lot of selection. The reason I’m only giving it 4 stars is we had issues with their payment system when checking in which led to us having to sit there for 1.5 hours. Paying by pin kept declining as it was coming through our bank as a high amount cash advance, finally after paying by signature it went through as a regular credit card transaction. Also as mentioned in other reviews, the pillows have a very weird smell– like meat or something rotten. We even had our pillows switched and sadly they still had the same smell. I think they just need a different brand of pillows. I would stay here again though."

What I noticed was that the hotel was clean, from the lobby to the symposium area. The staff in the lobby were also very friendly in providing directions, including when I asked where the symposium was being held. I spent some time relaxing by the pool overlooking the beach. While enjoying some drinks prepared by the barista at the nearby counter. It was truly enjoyable to relax like this. Highly recommended!"
"81.","C Heinz","8","2025-07-31","5","My friend Denese and I booked into this resort on Booking . Com for the 8 July 2025 believing that the price was a $120.00 a night, not $1,200 a night. Us believing we had obtained a bargain of a life time when we arrived. Oh how beautiful it was. We began our reservations process and the young man proceeded to request our card for a $12000 payment. Oh my how could this happen, the young man with almost fluent English and a kind nature that only a true professional could display, could see the shock we were in. We wish we could recall his name, but he was working Reception, he was truly amazing. He went over and beyond to ensure we managed to cancel the booking, obtain our non refundable deposit, calm us, assist us in obtaining a Gojeck to our more modest and affordable motel room in Sanur, and ensure we departed safely. I believe this young man is an asset to such a high quality hotel where customer service is valuable. Young man we hope you are recognized and appreciated by your employers as somebody that deserves to be acknowledged and awarded for your performance, compassion and competence in handling a very delicate and embarrassing situation. The Bali Beach Hotel was exquisite from the moment we arrived. We are sure you will receive good karma in this life We would like you to achieve great career opportunities and promotions as you deserve it. Any company should be privileged that you work for them. Thank You Denese Beesley and Christa Bradley"
"82.","Vani","29","2025-05-31","5","Pengalaman menginap yang luar biasa di Hotel Bintang 5 Bali Beach Sanur! Cocok untuk perjalanan bisnis dan liburan keluarga. Fasilitas dan pelayanan sangat baik. Namun, ada sedikit kekurangan pada proses check-in yang memakan waktu lama dan ketersediaan kamar yang tidak sinkron. Meskipun demikian, staff hotel sangat bertanggungjawab dan memberikan kompensasi Lounge Access sebagai tanda permintaan maaf. Terima kasih atas hospitality yang hangat! 10/10, hampir sempurna 🌟"
"83.","J Youssef","15","2025-07-01","5","Our stay at the Bali Beach Hotel and The Meru was absolutely incredible from beginning to end. From the moment we arrived, we felt welcomed and well cared for. Esa, our airport driver, gave us a warm and friendly welcome to Bali, setting the tone for a fantastic trip. A heartfelt thank you to Arlina, who generously upgraded our room from the Bali Beach Hotel to the Meru Resort – an unexpected surprise that made our stay even more special. The Meru was stunning: modern, peaceful, and beautifully maintained. One of the true highlights of our stay was dining at the Rosa restaurant. The whole team was wonderful, but Bayu truly stood out. His exceptional service, attention to detail, and warm, genuine nature made every meal feel personal and memorable. He consistently went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and cared for — always remembering our preferences and checking in to make sure everything was perfect. There were no issues at all during our stay; neither at Bali beach hotel nor the Meru — just complete comfort, kindness, and amazing service. We wholeheartedly recommend the Bali Beach Hotel and The Meru to anyone visiting Sanur. We can’t wait to return!"
"84.","Matt Billett","30","2025-07-01","1","I've been staying at this hotel since 2002—probably over 15 times. On my most recent trip to Bali this week, I wanted to walk through the hotel grounds to see if I’d like to stay here again on my next visit, as it has been completely rebuilt in the past two years since my last stay (the reason I stayed elsewhere this visit). However, as I approached the gates near Sanur Hospital, I was immediately stopped by two security guards who questioned where I was staying. I explained that I was at the hotel next door (Prime Plaza) and simply wanted to walk through to see the hotel for my next visit. I was quickly turned away and told that only current guests were allowed entry. I've never experienced anything like this in Bali. How is a longtime guest supposed to see the new property and guage if they want to stay here again in the future if they're not even allowed to walk in? After so many years of loyalty, I’m extremely disappointed by this sudden unwelcoming attitude. Unfortunately, you’ve lost a long time customer - and I won’t be recommending the hotel to my extended family, who also frequently stay here."
"85.","Tiffany Anggi","25","2025-07-01","5","Came here for staycation at least once a month, hope we can do weekly now 😜 We love it so much, room is very nice, food UNBELIEVABLY GOOD! Love the breakfast buffet options too ☺️"

Now that we’re staying at this hotel, I want to share that with my husband—waking up early together to enjoy the sunrise, just like I used to. The staff were absolutely wonderful and incredibly friendly. The hotel is also a historic place that’s been beautifully remodeled—everything was spotless!"

"93.","Milo Petrovic","7","2025-05-01","1","The communication begore arriving on whatsapp with the reservation team was very poor and bad...it takes long to get an answer and it its not helpfull. Checking in was also not a great experience but ok so far so good When going to our room there where some stuff broken (due to bad maintenance. After complaining we receive a free upgrade. That was offcourse a great gesture. But after all the service of the hotel is really bad. There are to many unqualified people Who dont know how to give service. They are all very friendly but they dont give you any 5 star service....even no 4 star service, and when paying so much money at least you want to expect this. There are 3 elevators for around 300 people....so expect long waiting times for going up or down...you feel people where very frustrating about it After all it was not what we expected. The Area is really nice. But the building is very old what they are trying to make it modern...but the basic facilities are old fashioned"

"96.","Valerie Pui","2","2024-12-31","5","Had a really enjoyable stay at Bali Beach Hotel for one night, especially because of the local bike tour I joined led by Oka. I really liked the path we took - travelled the main roads was fun and chill, also passed by the smaller roads by the beach and cafes/restaurants on the way back. Oka is very friendly, genuine and he is overall a fun person to hang out with. He is very happy to answer all questions I had about the local culture, people and festivals! Coincidentally the day of the tour was Kuningan day so Oka showed me the celebrations too on one of the destinations. Really recommend this bike tour if you are staying at this hotel. The room is also very comfortable, design of facilities is sleek and tasteful. Overall staff members are very warm and provide good service."

Lokasi sangat strategis di Sanur, dekat dengan pelabuhan boat ke Nusa Penida, dekat RM Mak Beng yg legend, tepat di tepi pantai yg bersih & tenang. Akses masuk gelap sekali klo malam, perlu ditambah lampu2. Sarapan standard. Staff & karyawan ramah2. Suasana hotel & kamar tenang dengan view yang cantik sekali apalagi klo bangun pagi bisa langsung lihat sunrise dr kamar. Yang perlu perbaikan di bangunan tua, furniture ada yg jebol, karpet berdebu, kamar mandi air panas nya mati, kolam renang berlumut. Semoga ada perbaikan ya sayang sekali klo kurang terawat karena hotel Grand Inna Sanur ini sebetulnya bagus banget. Bintang 3 dulu ya..."

Some parts were under construction. Shoutout to first President of Indonesia Soekarno, who was the planner for this hotel. Trivia: The hotel was once burned down, but there was a room that some staff believed was a mystical room associated with the Indonesian myth of Nyi Roro Kidul also known as the Queen of the Southern Sea. Surprisingly, only that room (Room 327) did not get burned. Soekarno himself believed in that urban legend. So Soekarno basically booked a room for her (ratu selatan) or it was indeed the room, Soekarno used to stay. Correct me if i'm wrong. Y'all get the idea. Anyway. Lastly, the hospitality from the staff was excellent. Especially, Mba Yunita for walking us through the hotel, and telling the history of this hotel (if you see my message, im happy for it 🙂).

Cocok bagi yg suka hotel dgn pantai pribadi. Tp sayang ga boleh pesan taksi/ojol dari luar krn dihotel ada taksi (hotel ke bandara 200 rb). Saran bagi yg punya anak kecil baiknya bawa perbekalan snack yg cukup krn jauh dari pertokoan krn hotel ini komplek kawasan grand inna. Makanan diresto lumayan mahal. Nasgor sayuran sj 42 rb. Breakfast lengkap. Sebelahnya dermaga kapal penyebrangan ke nusa penida. Kpn2 klo ke bali ke sini lagi ahhhhh."

I booked a room in front of the beach and every morning I saw many people doing exercise like cycling, running, and swimming and some of tourists there were sun bathing. It was a good view to relax because i love beach so much. And the hospitality??? They were so kind and they will help you kindly and the room is so clean and neat. The room follows the archipelago building so If you’re Indonesian you’ll feel the Javanese architecture."

Kebersihan kamarnya minus, banyak kerak di toilet, debu di bawah tempat tidur dan gorden, dan pastinya nyamuk. So siap siap autan ya gais. Untuk sarapannya juga tidak ada variasi sama sekali. Gw nginap 4D3N di hotel ini, dan menu sarapan yang disajikan hanya itu itu saja. Petugas tidak semuanya ramah, rata-rata petugas sudah berumur jadinya ngelayaninnya males malesan, terutama petugas penerima tamu lobby. Kesimpulan: kalau ke bali dan berniat untuk nyantai dan menikmati sunrise di pantai, hotel ini cocok banget, suasana bali dan tenangnya dapet banget, asalkan kalian siap dengan pelayan yang sudah berusia lanjut dan tidak sigap serta kebersihan kamar yang kurang. Score *6/10"

Very clean, comfortable bed with good pillows and good service from the staff. Pool would need more cleanup and breakfast is a buffet. It's alright and simple. There was a lot of tiny spider everywhere. A bit away from the crowd. Overall I recommend as it is very nice."

"142.","kira nyx","4","2022-12-31","3","Due to location in a their own complex, we were greeted by somewhat a confusing security guard. He kept asking whether we stay in resort or not despite what we said about our reservation. It's like he doesn't want any guest whatsoever. Awful interaction. The room itself wasn't bad, just typical old school hotel type. They provided towels, but were some stains on them. Good thing I brought my own. The air conditioner wasn't cold, I assume because it was an old type. Kinda uncomfortable to sleep in. Overall good, just unpleasant security check before even come into the complex."
"143.","Matt Lewis","21","2016-12-31","3","It has a massive pool with shade and the place is very quiet, great to go to if you truly want to veg out and relax. Where it needs improving is what they call accessible bathrooms - they really aren't. The rooms also look aged and a little run down, though for $25 a night twin share, it ain't a bad place to stay."

Ada 2 kolam renang beda tempat. Salah satunya banyak pepohonan. Nyaman banget buat santai. Aman juga walaupun di tinggal lewat pintu belakang tanpa di kunci.."
"145.","Michael Santoso","10","2018-12-31","5","The locations is wonderful. From your room, you can just take a short stroll to the beach. It is perfect for people who likes to wake up in the morning to watch sunset or just be near the beach. The service is on point. They responded to telephone calls with only 1-2 minutes delay. The room cleaning service is also great and fast, almost perfect. There are 2 types of room, the room in a building or the room in a cottage or villa. I rented the one that's in a villa and it's awesome. You get this feeling of being submerged in nature. I highly recommend this hotel to the beach lovers and travelers."

Pelayanan hotel juga ramah juga kolam renangnya sangat bagus. Saya setiap kali berkunjung ke pulau dewata bali selalu pilihan hotel di denpasar jatuh ke Inna Bali. Karena tempatnya yang berdekatan dengan pantai sanur. Juga kalo memilih kamar yang tingkat kita bisa melihat view pantai sanur keseluruhan. Untuk breakfastnya sangat bervariasi untuk indonesia maupun turis mancanegara. Pernah satu waktu juga bertepatan dengan hari penting. Tiba2 ada surprise dari karyawan hotel yaitu santa clause. Dan memberi permen kepada anak2.... kalo kalian datang ke Bali bersama keluarga saya sarankam anda menginap di hotel ini.. worth it lah 😊"
"150.","Quatermass","386","2020-12-31","5","This place is HUGE. It's kind of old style but we did not mind this. This massive complex was fun to explore. It has a deserted feel, rather than throbbing with life, which we also did not mind. The room had a thick and effectively sound proof glass door out to the balcony, and the sunrise view was brilliantly spectacular. Never forget it. The best parts were before the sun actually popped over the horizon. Downright beautiful. A good view of Mt Agung too. Ask for a shore facing room. Down on the beach there's much activity. Like most beaches in Bali, there are rocks in the water so swimming is no good. However it was a memorable stay, and not too pricey."
"151.","F H","52","2020-12-31","5","Liked · - Big rooms with comfortable bed and pillows. - Such a nice view from the window. - Clean and nice beach. - The restaurant in the hotel is good. - There is an ATM near from the building. - It is super easy to find taxis in front of the hotel.

"154.","shweta mishra","29","2018-12-31","2","The location is very good however the rooms aren't that good. The bathrooms need serious renovation. There are many many many insects including lizards in the room. The room decor is old style, which is okay however there is need of renovation in the dressing areas. The wardrobe is chipped at many places. Bathrooms don't have very good hot water and overall the lighting in the rooms is very dim. Don't go by the grand looks of the property. I was here for 3 days. At lounge, there were few ladies who were too loud with music, and didn't bother if they were disturbing others. The welcome drink needs to be collected by yourself. So, I didn't get this concept of going and asking for your welcome drink. They could have at least provided in room, if not at the reception. I have stayed for 15 days in Bali, and the welcome drink offered to you is a custom, rather than collecting yourself. Two stars are just for the ocean view and location of the hotel."
"155.","Popi Oktapiyana","23","2016-12-31","3","It is a nice place to stay, it has a building, cottage and second floor building. The second floor building is quite old, I stayed for two night. In my opinion, the room is very big with balcony, vintage furniture, bathroom works great but you will find it is very old and they need to change the bath tub and shower because it is yellowish. It is very nice to see the beach behind it."

The room was comfortable but old and basic. The bathroom was in poor condition. Breakfast was ok, not many options and it's the same every day. The best thing about the hotel was it's location."

Kurangnya power socket 3. View: view ke pantai sanur sangat amat luar biasa (foto akan saya sertakan) 4. Pelayanan: baik 5. Sanitary: sanitary bekerja dengan baik. Tapi kalau bisa untuk faucet dan shower mixer diperbaiki agar bentuknya baik (karena yg saya dapat ini kondisinya seperti mau copot) 6. Door window: untuk pintu menuju balkon agak susah untuk dibuka maupun ditutup Jika sudah tidak pandemi, menginap di Grand Inna Bali Beach adalah sebuah rekomendasi. Btw saya di kamar 532👍🏻"

"164.","T N","7","2018-12-31","4","It's a very large hotel, with cottages, a garden wing with rooms in two levels and a large 'tower' wing. We stayed in a cottage, and while it was old and a bit worn, it was also clean, quiet and comfortable. It is a great place with kids, there are three pool areas and lots of beach front with lounge chairs. The restaurants are OK, but not as good as others in Sanur, so we were glad we just opted for breakfast rather than full board."
"165.","Miko","162","2017-12-31","3","Saya menginap di Cottage yg letaknya paling selatan. Ada jasa antar-jemput gratis sampai lobby. Begitu masuk saya dan keluarga langsung disambut nyamuk yg banyak sekali, ga mungkin saya biarkan anak balita saya dikeroyok nyamuk. Akhirnya saya harus jalan jauh untuk membeli semprotan anti nyamuk. Pengalaman yg tidak enak untuk dikenang. Padahal tempatnya strategis sekali, ada akses langsung ke pantai sanur. Namun cottagenya sendiri nampak kurang terawat, waktu lepas sepatu kami menyadari klo lantainya kotor sekali. Ada juga instalasi listrik yg kendor sehingga kegeser sedikit maka lampu dan TV mati, saat digeser, timbul percik2 listrik. Deg2an takut menyambar ranjang dan menimbulkan kebakaran. Akhirnya kasur saya geser agak maju. Penerangan jalanan juga remang2 dan cenderung gelap, tidak direkomendasikan keluar cottage malam hari. Saya suka sekali dgn akses langsung ke pantai, sangat strategis untuk melihat sunrise di Bali, tp pengalaman tersebut membuat saya tidak bs merekomendasikan cottage di Grand Inna Bali Beach."

Room servicing is very good. There are 5 restaurants, 3 with beach frontage - prices are not unreasonable for the setting. The pools have sections for children.

The food they provided for free of charge for the rooms were a mix of international and local dishes. Neither of them tasted okay. Even though its poor appearance the hotel was quite full, lots of families we kids running around. If you want to relax this is definitely not a place to stay for you."

"208.","IWAYAN ARDANA","450","2022-12-31","4","Sekilas tentangHotel Bali Beach, nama asal Inna Grand Bali Beach, dibangun bersama tiga hotel berbintang di tiga kota lainnya, sebuah visi pariwisata yang dirintis Presiden Sukarno dengan tujuan mengedepankan Indonesia di dunia pariwisata internasional. Empat hotel itu dibangun dari dana pampasan perang pemerintah Jepang. Yuke Ardhiati dalam buku Bung Karno Sang Arsitek (2004) menuliskan, sebelum munculnya peristiwa Dekrit Presiden 1959, di tahun 1958 Sukarno telah berhasil merintis lobi dengan pemerintah Jepang dalam upaya pengembalian dana pampasan perang. Akhirnya terwujud Pakta Perjanjian bahwa Jepang akan membayar US$223 juta selama 12 tahun, akan menghapuskan utang niaga Indonesia sebesar hampir US$177 juta, dan akan memberikan bantuan ekonomi sebesar US$400 juta. Sedangkan program-program pampasan yang berkaitan dengan pembangunan arsitektural ditemukan dalam sejumlah proyek arsitektur, antara lain Hotel Indonesia (Jakarta), Hotel Bali Beach (Bali), Tonichi Hotel Ambarrukmo (Yogyakarta), Tonichi Samudra Beach Hotel (Jawa Barat), dan Tonichi Gedung Wisma Nusantara (Jakarta). Semua dibangun perusahaan konstruksi Jepang. Kutip Sarasvati 2017"

Around sink in bathroom was mouldy and was hair in sink plug. So the one night we stayed their out of six was to long , no sleep, and was coughing because I got sick with my asthma. There was no remorse from the management.. So the 12 of us moved to another motel which was 3 and half star.

At the first time, the hotel men accused us that we used too much power for curling iron. In fact, we only used hair dyer from the hotel's bathroom. When it went for the third time, they finally believed that there was something wrong with the panel or something. The good is, the hoteI men were responsive. It's room 713.

Interiors are definitely from the 90s (opened in 1966 but renovated in 1993) and hasn't changed, it's like stuck in time. Unfortunately the public toilet near the Agung ballroom isn't very clean. The ballroom looks a bit worn out and the air conditioners aren't cold enough. Renovation would be so much better for this old property. The good thing of this hotel is that it is facing directly to the sea. Only came here working as a senate team for a senior graduation event in the ballroom."

Please understand that this is an old hotel built many years ago. If I recall it right, this was built in the first president era, so it was tens years ago. With that in mind you can expect the facility is quite old though it won’t be a huge problem. And considering the facility and location, I can say the price is inexpensive."

Bentuk bangunan hotelnya cenderung bangunan lama yah, tapi untuk resort nya sekarang saya lihat sudah mulai di renovasi beberapa bagian. Yang paling OK adalah terdapat jogging track yg lumayan panjang (kurang lebih 7km) dari ujung hingga ujung di Pantai Sanur. Jadi pemandangan yg indah menemani kita selagi kita running di pagi atau sore hari. Pantai Sanur cocok sekali untuk liburan keluarga, lokasinya yg tidak terlalu ramai, namun banyak hal yg bisa dilakukan disini. Jika ingin ke Nusa Penida bisa naik speed boat dari Pantai Sanur.

But there are lots of tourists here for a beach holiday and I can imagine that for them the rooms are below European standard. The hotel has fast and reliable wifi at all places including the beach. The staff was very helpful when we wanted to change rooms to get 2 adjacent rooms. There is also some flexibility in checking out later than 12am if you ask for it.

Oh well, it's Bali. My double room was spacious and had all MOD come, kettle, TV, even reading lamps. However, the food left a lot to be desired.

So you must spend a lot more time and energy to get off the highway if you use public transport. But you will get a suitable atmosphere for rest and drawing inspiration. Very good services and very friendly employees will make you feel at home to stay here for a long time. In addition to a swimming pool with nice jazz live-music at night and a small hall like a diamond for an exclusive wedding, this hotel had a beach that is perfect for hunting sunrise photos. And don't forget that it serves very nice foods. I strongly encourage you to stay here."

Several problems with air conditioner leaking, plumbing & room safe not working but all fixed promptly. Pools nice. Had incident with room cleaner, caught him stealing just purchased items from our room that were still in rip curl shopping bags (surfing equipment) the cleaner initially said they were in room bin... they were not. We called management and they said he was putting our items in lost and found....even though they were in our room! After a discussion with cleaner and duty manager, the cleaner admitted that they were not in our bin. Hotel management didn't really care and we asked to check out and were denied a refund, as we have never had issues before like this at any other hotel in 30 years of traveling to bali. They said ...ring expedia. First and last time staying here."

Gang tembus pantai (iasanya saya parkir di dekat Mak Beng) Saat menuju parkiran saya sopan hargai staff GIBC yg tugas ; bilang hendak ke parkiran menuju pantai. Eh, malah saya diminta uang 5000rupiah. Padahal orang yang sebelumnya masuk tanpa ditanyakan bahkan tdk bayar. Akhirnya Ok saya bayar 5rb. Sampai diparkiran amburadul tdk tertata. Sepulangnya saya melihat banyak yang masuk memang tdk bayar. Bahkan bukan orang balimasuk ya masuk saja. Pertanyaan saya kenapa saya orng lokal bali(asli denpasar yang hendak Banyu Pinaruh) dan staff juga org bali itu meminta uang ke saya. Kalau parkir motor maksimal 2ribu. Jika memang bayar, buat aturan jangan seenaknya minta uang. Karena sy lihat banyk yg masuk tdk bayar makanya sy buat review ini. Kalau semua yg masuk bayar juga ya saya tdk masalah.suksma"

The cottage is nice and all are nicely distant from each other. Of course Bali is like an open Forrest, so you will a few harmless animals surrounding you, especially birds, geckos, and squirrels, and the occasional frogs, which we found hopping out of our room one time when we walked in :-) There was an incident first night when we arrived, we heard nioses in roof, must've been a squirrel I guess, but we called the lobby and they sent someone right away who went up into the roof and inspected, and after we heard nothing for the remainder of our stay. The beach side is nice, with a nice set of restaurants and facilities to sit at and enjoy the ocean view. They have a golf course and tennis courts ... we didn't check neither.

"283.","Christopher Sharp","90","2018-12-31","3","Interesting to visit for its history and it had sufficient amenities; having experienced other types of accomodation in Bali now, it's hard to give it more than 3 stars for two reasons: 1) It's dated. Despite what seems like a mammoth effort by groundskeepers and the like, parts of it are clearly falling into disrepair. This is both an aesthetic issue and a practical one; the air con in my room barely delivered. I can manage sleeping in heat fine, but my seventeen month old found it a challenge. 2) It's relatively expensive for what you recieve. You'll pay pretty handsomely for their breakfast buffet (not disparaging the quality there, just relative cost), as well as any minibar items and their laundry service (far cheaper to walk the 10 minutes to the nearest off site laundry). Having said that, all of the staff I met were lovely, particularly to my child. In addition, they have some excellent drivers working there, one of whom has really made my trip."

Temanya: Leading the Way to Sustainable Tourism, lantas sustainability policy nya apa ya untuk nge lead, biar nggak kejeglos? Dapat pelajaran baru ; the difference between Sustainable Tourism, Ecotourism, and Responsible Travel Ecotourism is a niche segment of tourism in natural areas. Sustainable Tourism does not refer to a specific type of tourism, rather it is an aspiration for the impacts of all forms of tourism to be sustainable for generations to come. Responsible Travel is a term referring to the behavior and style of individual travelers. The behaviors align with making a positive impact to the destination rather than negative ones.

I would say this 40 year old hotel/resort/complex is OLD, sad, run down, completely way over priced, not value for money, avoidable. Everything in the halls and rooms is old and falling apart. The furniture is all old, scratched and dented. All the the wiring and controls for lights and AC are from the last century. Cant believe they charged $190 a day here for this poorly run place. For this price you would think everything would be modern, new working perfectly. Look at the Room Service Menu - it should be replaced with a new one - not an old one with scribbles left by a child. Our 1st room had no fridge. It had a TV with a constant shadow in the centre and the stand was screwed into the dresser. The bathroom had supports for old people made of surplus plumbing pipes. The tile grouting was disgusting and black/unclean. The white sealant around the bathroom fittings was now mouldy and black. Our 2nd room was better but had no safe bit one was delivered after requesting it. I’m sure it was beautiful and more advanced than anywhere else on the island, but that was 40 years ago. We are totally and utterly disappointed :-( We definitely would not recommend this accommodation to anyone"

"331.","Nurainy Darono (Dear Rainy)","39","2021-12-31","1","This is a really really really old hotel. I don't know how old, but it's definitely old. I can tell from the building exterior and interior. I stayed here for two nights, and there are so many things wrong with this hotel and staff. Let me tell you how it went (when you start reading, you gotta finish it) 👇 1. Right from the start, we came in the lobby. We were greeted nicely by a lady. Then she said the reception is on the 2nd floor. We went upstairs. There was only one person, who was helping another customer (a man). I waited for a couple minutes. Then the lady who greeted us came on the 2nd floor with another customer and she was helping another customer checking in! WTH. We met downstairs and she just ignored me?? I complained immediately. She defended herself she thought I was family member of the man checking-in Come on, stop with your ASSUMPTION hotel staff. You could have asked instead of making stupid assumption in your head. 2. Then we came in to our room. The floor was carpet. You know how dirty carpet can be. Right then, I can feel the dirt on my feet when I came in. Also, the carpet outside bathroom was wet! The TV desk was full of dust! (See the pictures). I called room service immediately. After a few minutes, no one came. I called again, I waited. I called again. Oh man, I gave up. We went outside the hotel for dinner. 3. After we came back later that night, we called room service again, and thank God, someone actually came and cleaned it. 4. The first morning, we went downstairs pretty early for breakfast (actually the first people came to the restaurant). Our room wasn't listed in the breakfast list!!!! Dude! I paid already for two nights with breakfast. The staff asked for breakfast voucher and receptionist didn't gave us during check in. I told the staff to call the receptionist to double check. So he did. While my mom went upstairs to the room and tried to find breakfast voucher. A couple minutes after, my mom came back (without the voucher), and there were a bunch of people (6-7 people a family with kids I suppose) walked to the restaurant too. Another staff (a different one), greeted all of usssss. And again this staff ASSUME that we were all together and said two rooms for your family. I didn't want to make a scene, but that was stupid to assume. Why do you assume instead of asking???? Then I raised my voice and said No, we're not together with those people. We're from room 703. Can we now have breakfast? How frustrating and how stupid! This hotel wasn't fully booked and the staff couldn't even manage a few bookings/customers. I guess the staff remember me then, and before I left the restaurant, I said loud and clear we're here for two nights, and we'll be back tomorrow morning 5. I was gone the whole day that day to Nusa Lembongan. I believe the only good thing about this hotel is its location. It's so close to the Sanur Port (access fastboat to Nusa Lembongan/Ceningan/Penida) that I could just walk there. 6. Another thing that I should highlight is their shower head (see pics) that's not a real shower head. Did I get unlucky to get a room with tiny shower head? Or all of the rooms have this kind of shower head? I don't know. But this is the first hotel I found in Bali with shower head like this. It's hard to shower with that, if you can imagine. 7. The second morning, we came back for breakfast. Wow amazing, they remembered us, and our room is on the list. They did breakfast quite differently that morning compared to the morning before. The food is more limited and I couldn't have both guava juice and fruit (I could only chose one). Okay I guess understand, the hotels are cutting budget, so it's reasonable. Overall, you could get a better deal at some places else. This place isn't recommended. I would never come back here ever again. Hope you can learn from my experience. Thanks for reading."

There is a seafood restaurant near pool and they did bring our food to poolside but it didn't seem to be a serviced pool in food/drinks perspective. They had burger and chips was about $8 with tax I think. 2 small slides into kids pool but very small really, suit 4-5 yo ok. Prices in general, spa and food were more than expect to pay in Bali. Small shop dear. Money exchange lower rate than on street. Drinks in bar dearer than on street. buffet breakfast was ok but nothing wow. we thought staff not as friendly as other places we've been.

When you enter this hotel you will be greeted with melodious traditional music with a spacious lobby. Next to this hotel there are many places that sell souvenirs and there is also a BNI bank office, making it easier for customers who use the bank. The parking lot is big but I think they must improve their facilities that are looking old day by day."

"362.","Rui Xavier","7","2018-12-31","1","The worst hotel stay ever in our lifetime of travels!!!! Nothing like the website represents, extremely poor rooms with toilets that require 6 flushes or more, taps that need a skilled plumber to operate and leak, aircon that does not reach ideal room temperature as the controls do not operate correctly, fused globes in the room and all about the hotel, 2 plug points in the room taken up by TV and kettle - no others available. House keeping lacks detail to cleanliness. Hotel in serious need of a major revamp. Breakfast included but most of the available options are undercatered for and finish before most of the guests complete their breakfast (8:30). Staff are more concerned about keeping record of guest arrivals to breakfast than keeping the meal options available during breakfast. When this issue was addressed with staff member in charge, an insincere apology and a shrug of the shoulders was the response. Nothing done about rectifying the empty containers. No guest concern whatsoever. A simple thing like the availability of pool towels for guests is a lucky draw. When questioned, sorry finished was the response. Not even an attempt to make alternative arrangements. Most staff unfriendly and avoid guests, reception not willing to give a phone number for a local taxi service and insisted we use theirs. Their exploited cost for the same service was 250,000rp vs what the local taxi charged us 110,000rp! A total damper on our stay. Will NEVER book in an Inna group hotel again, will not recomend to anyone I know and warn those to seek other options where value for money and guest concern at the very least is given."

"381.","Taco de Vries","1097","2024-12-31","4","Bali beach hotel is the oldest multi story hotel in Bali built after WW2 with Japanese war reparation funds. Attached was a 9 hole golf course. That all changed during the covid days when a plan was conceived to built international hospital on part of the golfcourse and to rehabilitate the old Bali beach. The peculiar thing about the original building was that at the time it was built, there was a rule by the Hindu priests that buildings should not be taller than coconut trees. That all has been sacrificed. Bali beach hotel used to house the Thai airways Bali office. No more. After the covid days the office was closed, and there is for the moment no thai airways office in Bali. The international hospital is completed."

So nice that we changed our plans and attemped to book another night. I asked the conceirge to book another night and asked me to do it online. I went up to the room to book another night, then went down to confirm our check out to be a day later. He said everything was ok and that our check out was set. The next day I was called by reception to verify our booking. I went down with the confirmation email and they said I booked the resort instead of the deluxe tower. I asked them why the reception told me everything was all good when it was not. They asked me to pay an extra 300,000 rp for our same room. It was extremely inconvenient! I had to explain the situation to 4 different staff members and when I agreed to pay the extra money, I had to go up and retrieve my credit card that they already had on file. Why they needed it again, I do not know. When I asked for compensation, they said they was nothing they could do.
