"1.","ghe rahadi","248","2025-11-30","5","10 out of 10. The relaxing stay we needed after 3 days of sailing. Bed was comfortable and we got to enjoy nice view from our room. Smooth check in and check out. Top notch hospitality from all staff, delicious breakfast, even got complimentary foot massage and airport transfer. Great location right in the city center. Truly 5 stars standart service. Would love to come back again!"
"2.","Erry Bakri","5","2025-10-30","5","We stayed at Meruorah Labuan Bajo after three nights of sailing, and it was the perfect place to relax after those rough days at sea. Everything about the hotel felt luxurious and refreshing. Maria was incredibly kind and helpful, she really looked after us and made our stay special. Since it was our honeymoon, the hotel prepared a beautiful room decoration and even surprised us with a complimentary cake, which was such a thoughtful gesture. The room itself was spacious, clean, and beautifully designed, with a stunning view of the ocean. The view from the hotel is absolutely breathtaking, especially during sunset, one of the best we’ve seen in Labuan Bajo. Breakfast was delicious with a wide variety of options, and the overall atmosphere was peaceful and relaxing. The hotel’s entrance is stunning, giving a great first impression. You can hear some noise from the port, but that’s part of being in such a central location. The great thing is that the hotel is walkable to many places in town, so it’s very convenient. We couldn’t have asked for a better place to unwind after our sailing trip. Highly recommended, especially for couples looking for comfort, great service, and amazing views!"

Breakfast buffet was delicious and catered to everyone’s taste. The hotel staff was amazing. They played with our 1,5 year son and watching them just filled my heart with love. So cute and kind and from the heart. Thank you so much!"
"4.","Mariana Henriques","11","2025-10-30","5","We absolutely loved our honeymoon experience here! The staff were incredible - super helpful and went above and beyond to make our stay unforgettable. They organized the best land and sea tours for us, which made exploring the area so easy and fun. The location and view are amazing, we could walk everywhere and enjoy the stunning surroundings. A special thank you to Ramli, who was incredibly kind, attentive, and always eager to help with anything we needed. 5 stars! Our room was luxurious and had a beautiful view, truly the perfect place to relax and celebrate our honeymoon. Highly recommend Meruorah Hotel for anyone looking for a memorable and romantic stay! 🌅💖"
"5.","brad underhill","12","2025-09-30","5","Terrific hotel! Service was perfect. Location perfect. Room was very good with amazing views and meals first class. Pool nothing special (well great views but hard to imagine it is used all that much). But the focus is on diving and dragons and the beautiful region and this is the perfect hotel to stay at for those activities. We had a great time."
"6.","Noor Azreen","4","2025-09-30","5","I had an amazing stay at this hotel! They went far beyond my expectations by providing excellent hospitality from start to finish. The staff were warm, welcoming, and always ready to help with a smile, which made me feel truly at home. The facilities were well-maintained and of great quality, making my stay very comfortable. On top of that, the location is perfect — convenient and accessible, with everything I needed close by. Overall, this hotel delivers the best combination of service, comfort, and location. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a memorable stay."
"7.","Nikhil Bedi","1","2025-09-30","1","We booked this hotel for 2 nights and actually left after the first night and rebooked our flights and got a hotel for an extra night in our next destination - this hotel was the main reason. Let me start with this - the hotel has amazing location and the view from the lobby is amazing. However, unfortunately there’s a lot that can be improved with this hotel: - We had booked an airport transfer with the hotel and the car never arrived. The hotel couldn’t even locate their driver. Reading some of the previous reviews, it seems like a common occurrence. I actually paid for an upgrade to a sea view room from the hill view room but that was probably a big mistake. - We were on the 5th floor right under the pool and we wanted to go to bed early but we couldn’t because you can hear the pool water splashing in your room until there’s guests in the pool. - The room has really bad sound proofing. There was a boat with a party in the harbour until midnight and we could clearly hear the lyrics to the songs approximately 800 meters away from the boat. Btw if you’re on the other side you’ll hear to mosque so there’s no getting away from this. - We set the temperature to 18 in our room and it never got to that temperature. It stayed around 23. We called front desk, they sent an engineer who fixed it and it started cooling in a bit but in a couple hours went back to the same old. - The staff never even asked us why we’re leaving early or how the stay was. I generally found the staff to be very unhelpful and not very courteous. Probably the least helpful staff of all hotels I’ve ever stayed at in my lifetime."
"8.","Linda Wahyuningsih","7","2025-12-16","5","Bermalam 3 hari, hotel dekat pelabuhan bajo bisa jalan kaki, kalau hari sedang cerah maka akan beruntung dengan pemandangan sunset yang cantik, service baik. Even if you stay in Labuan Bajo without joining any island-hopping trips, staying here is still enjoyable and relaxing."
"9.","rosalind vivia tansy","7","2025-08-30","5","We stayed at Meruorah Hotel after a 3-day sailing trip, and it was the perfect choice. The sea-view room was spacious, comfortable, and well-equipped, while the staff were genuinely warm and attentive. The in-house activities made our stay extra special—afternoon tea, a complimentary foot massage, and sunset yoga (highly recommended!). The spa therapists are truly skilled, and the cocktails were excellent at a great price. The location is ideal—just minutes from the harbor and night fish market, with a jogging path nearby. Even the hotel lobby felt refreshing and welcoming. We’d love to come back for a longer stay! (photo: sea view from my room & the nice walking path)"
"10.","Carole S. Enriquez","3","2025-08-30","5","In the heart of Labuan Bajo. The hotel itself is top notch! From the moment you arrive, the friendly and attentive staff make you feel right at home. The atmosphere is warm, professional, and welcoming—perfect for both relaxation and adventure. Rooms are modern, clean, and comfortable, many offering stunning views over the harbor. The location couldn't be better, with easy access to the marina, restaurants, and Komodo tour operators. Breakfast is a highlight, with a great variety of local and international dishes. There's something for everyone, including traditional Indonesian options, fresh fruits, pastries, and even jamu (herbal drinks). You’ll leave full and satisfied, ready for a day of exploring. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Labuan Bajo—whether it’s your first time or a return trip!"
"11.","email M","4","2025-10-30","5","The hotel is lovely, really appreciate that we were upgraded to a slightly larger room! The location and view of this hotel is very good. Daily buffet breakfast was my favourite, good variety of food and juices. Love the infinity pool and sun beds. Hotel staff very professional and helpful, just as a 5 star hotel should be."
"12.","Jessica Rusli","335","2025-10-30","5","the view was sooo amazing! absolutely loved our experience staying here. the room very spacious and comfy. we can see the amazing scenery from our balcony. also the location of the hotel is very very strategic. their service also excellent, always ready to help."
"13.","Rafika Rizkinia","14","2025-11-30","3","Very bad service yg aku mention supaya diimprove kedepannya adalah, cara staff mengantar complimentary ke room. Ada satu staff yg ring a bell plus ngetuk pintu berkali-kali seperti tidak sabaran banget. Ini bad experience sih, so far sepengelaman saya nginep di 5 stars itu ya misal ada staff yg ring bell atau ketuk pintu cukup sekali atau max 2xaja, trs nunggu sampe kami membukanya. Laah ini pencet bel berkali2, ketuk pintu pun juga berkali2, such an annoying. Tolong yg staff seperti itu perlu ditraining kembali, biar meet standar pelayanan bintang 5. Selain itu amenities juga standar banget sekelas 5 stars. Terus bekas bedak yg berjatuhan dimeja tidak mereka bersihkan/lap, okelah tidak ditata barang2nya saya tolerir, walaupun hotel 5 stars lain so far nata2 barang2 yg dimeja sampe kadang presisi, tapi ini bekas bedak berserakan pun ga dilap at least."
"14.","Adrian Noguera","6","2025-09-30","5","This hotel is located in a prime location not only by the seaside, but by the main strip as well where all the dive shops are located. I spent about a week here and the service was absolutely phenomenal. The airport shuttle service was great. The room itself was beautiful and clean. The lounge area on the ground floor and the top floor (where the restaurant and the spa are located) provided a very relaxing and beautiful view of the oceanside. The spa itself was amazing - great vibes and top-notch service. I would highly recommend staying here for your next dive trip or if you want to explore Labuan Bajo outside of diving."
"15.","Anisa Wulandari","5","2025-07-30","5","We had to wait a bit longer to get into our room, and when we asked, they said it wasn’t ready yet. Around 10 minutes later, a staff member named Devina came to us, apologized for the delay, and explained there was a laundry issue that day. She asked if it was okay to send the towels around 5 PM—I said it was fine, as long as we could just get some rest first. Not long after, she came back with the room key and even walked us to our room. In my opinion, once it hits the official check-in time (3 PM), the hotel should communicate better with guests if there are any issues. But I really appreciate how Devina handled it—she followed up with a call to our room and even checked in with us the next morning at breakfast. She wasn’t just being polite; she genuinely wanted to know how our stay was going and if anything needed improving. Overall, the staff here are very friendly, even if the hotel has a few things to improve. If I ever come back to Labuan Bajo, I’d still choose to stay at Meruorah because of the warm and thoughtful service."
"16.","jess chong","4","2025-07-30","5","Great location with spectacular view. Definitely a luxurious experience when you are living here. Hospitality is top notch, the only down side is that they keep the room very bare minimum we had to call to get bath robes, shower and conditioner, iron. Would recommend if you were to visit this beautiful island! Great sunset spot"
"17.","Maxime Bury","13","2025-11-30","2","The lobby & the rooftop pool are the highlights of the property. The room was nice (if strangely designed – you can see the toilet from the bed through the all-glass shower stall). Unfortunately, there was a litany of issues: a broken AC that wasn't fixed for over a day (after mentioning it twice) until I had to beg for a new room; extremely slow & incompetent service at the bar (45+ min to get a drink, out of Campari for 3 days but menu not updated / staff not informed); poor maintenance (damaged curtains, horribly shrieking door to the rooftop bar, AC not working); arbitrary rules such as the pool closing at 8PM; a music festival testing their sound equipment right under my room at 6:15AM; the wifi was not initially working in the first room, and was extremely unstable in the second one, and very slow (capped at 5Mbps in both cases); the hotel is right across from the mosque, depending on the room location you'll need earplugs. In the end, despite being twice the price of hotels like Oh!Julia in LBJ, the delivered product was lower quality."
"18.","Karel K. Himawan","283","2025-06-30","5","Location is superb! Easy access to the city center. The view in the lobby is amazing. I could stay there forever. The hotel in general seems could be maintained better. While I could see the luxury impression, they did not seem to optimally maintain the hotel. Too many stains spotted in floors. The fragrance used in many public areas smelled rather for a cheap, below standard smell. No hand and face towels were provided. Coffee and tea were below standard for a 5-stars hotel. They had an interesting big billboard to congratulates guests on special occasion, which is a creative entertainment. However, they missed to include our moment despite we had told them prior arrival. Staff were all super friendly."
"19.","Valérie Perez","3","2025-10-30","1","Our stay at the Hotel Meruorah Komodo was extremely disappointing and does not in any way meet the 5-star standard described. Upon arrival, the air conditioning in our room did not work. After waiting more than an hour, we were moved to another room. However, the new room was also unacceptable: the bed smelled unpleasant, the shower had a strong musty odor, and the room was extremely noisy – we could hardly sleep. The food quality was very poor, and we both suffered from nausea the next morning. Neither cleanliness, service, nor overall quality matched the descriptions or photos on the website. The price-performance ratio is completely unreasonable."
"20.","Katherine Mah","15","2025-06-30","5","We had a wonderful stay! The hospitality was truly great — warm and lovely staff. The place is clean and well-maintained. We stayed in an ocean view room and it was peaceful and quiet 🌊✨ Breakfast doesn’t have a huge variety, but everything we had was tasty. There’s so much for kids to do! From swimming and the playroom to the theatre room and even fish feeding — our little one was never bored 🐠🎬 Location is super convenient too — just walking distance to seafood street, restaurants, ATM, convenience store, and pharmacy. We also had dinner at the hotel — the food portions were big and our kiddo said their mashed potato was super yummy 🥔😋 Would definitely stay here again whenever we visit Komodo 💙"
"21.","Jeff Tjian","5","2025-08-30","1","I am writing to share feedback regarding my recent stay at your hotel. While I found your staff to be friendly and courteous, I was disappointed by the overall lack of service attention, which significantly impacted the quality of my experience at a five-star property. Some of the issues I encountered included: • The airport pick-up transfer was delayed upon arrival, causing inconvenience after a long journey. Staff member recommended to make order your own transport • Upon check-in, a dirty plate was left at the front door of my room. Despite several follow-ups, housekeeping failed to address this in a timely manner. • The tables in the foyer area were stained, leaving a poor first impression of the hotel’s upkeep. • On the first evening, I ordered cocktails, but the staff forgot to relay the order to the bar, resulting in a long wait. • The executive lounge was disappointing, as drinks required additional payment despite being described as complimentary. • On the day of my departure, staff forgot to book my transfer back to the airport as requested upon checking in on the first day, creating unnecessary stress. While I truly appreciate the friendliness of your staff, the repeated lapses in service and lack of attention to detail did not meet the standards I expect from a five-star establishment. I hope you take this feedback constructively to improve the guest experience and ensure greater service consistency in the future."
"22.","Walter -","6","2025-10-30","1","NOT RECOMMENDABLE -EXPENSIVE AND POOR SERVICE - MANY EXTRA CHARGES I arrived with high expectations, but my stay was marked by several serious disappointments. I had booked two rooms for three nights, and we dined in your restaurant on all three evenings. Yet, two out of three days there was no Coca-Cola available—not in the restaurant, nor in the bar. For a 5-star hotel, this is unacceptable. If supplies run out, replenishing them should be basic service, not a recurring issue. I was also shocked to be charged for beach towel rentals. In every other accommodation I’ve stayed at in Indonesia—including far less expensive ones—beach towels were provided without extra cost. For the premium rates your hotel charges, one would expect added value and service, not endless surcharges. At breakfast, the only water available was warm, stored at around 30°C. When I requested a cold bottle, it came with an additional charge. Again, this is not what I expect from a hotel of your category. In the restaurant, service staff seemed more focused on their supervisors than on guests. The pressure on them was evident, and as a result, attention to clients suffered noticeably. Finally, at checkout, I raised these issues and requested that at least the towel rental charge be waived. My request was dismissed coldly, with the explanation that the fee was “obligatory.” This response showed a complete lack of flexibility and client orientation. Overall, I did not experience the level of service a 5-star hotel should provide. Instead, I was left with the impression of a property more concerned with nickel-and-diming guests than delivering genuine hospitality. Sincerely, To resume I will definitely not stay with you during my next stay or recommend your facilities. Beat Regards"
"23.","Arvind Mohindra","87","2025-10-30","1","A Disappointing Stay at Merourah Hotel: Flooded Rooms, Poor Service, and Missed Expectations in Labuan Bajo Our stay at Merourah Hotel, including the 75 sqm Phiniziy Suite booked for two adults + child 13 year old, and a second room on the 5th floor for a couple friend, was a profoundly disappointing experience that fell far short of even basic hospitality standards. The litany of issues we encountered underscored a complete lack of attention to detail, poor service, and an outdated approach that felt like a relic of indifferent, old-school establishments. The breakfast experience was frustrating from the start. The à la carte menu was extremely limited, with no option to order individual items. If you wanted something simple like a coffee and eggs, you were out of luck—guests were forced to select from rigid, overpriced combo meals that lacked flexibility or value. This set a poor tone for the entire stay. The room conditions were even more unacceptable. The second room we booked on the 5th floor for our friends suffered severe flooding, with water pooling up to two inches under the bed, creating an unhygienic and uncomfortable environment. Housekeeping was another disaster. The Phiniziy Suite was not cleaned at all on one day, despite placing the flimsy “make up the room” sign on the door—a loose, poorly designed sign that can easily fall off or blow away. On another day, housekeeping took the used towels but failed to replace them with fresh ones, leaving us to chase down staff to resolve this basic necessity. Coming back exhausted and frustrated by the absence of towels was infuriating and unacceptable. The service throughout was lackluster at best. Staff were disengaged, unresponsive, and offered little assistance with our concerns, giving the impression that guest satisfaction was irrelevant. Adding to the frustration, despite paying for three adults in the Phiniziy Suite, the high tea service was only provided for two guests. We didn’t bother availing of it even once during our three-day stay, as it felt like yet another oversight in an already dismal experience. For the price paid, we were shocked to learn that the 69 sqm Ayana Suite, at a property in a completely different league of luxury and ambiance, was only 10% more expensive. The value at Merourah is simply nonexistent. To make matters worse, the hotel’s location on a noisy harbor made sleep nearly impossible. Instead of proper noise insulation, like double-glazed windows found in quality hotels, Merourah provides cheap earplugs as a lazy solution. This speaks volumes about their disregard for guest comfort. In summary, Merourah Hotel’s restrictive dining options, flooding in the 5th-floor room, inconsistent and incomplete housekeeping, indifferent service, inadequate high tea provisions, and poor noise management made for a thoroughly regrettable stay. For the price of the Phiniziy Suite and the additional room, we expected far better—especially when a superior option like Ayana is available for a marginal cost difference. I strongly advise travelers to avoid this hotel and choose accommodations that actually prioritize guest satisfaction. P.S. The hotel pool is noticeably smaller than our home pool. This property feels more like a 3-star city hotel than a 5-star experience."
"24.","Monica","9","2025-08-30","2","I have to review this hotel because of the quite disappointing experience we had. Unfortunately, even though it is a 5 star hotel, the service lacks completely an adequate level of quality. There is no flexibility whatsoever, here a few examples: when we asked to get a towel to take it to the tour organized by the hotel, the answer was no; or when we confirmed we could use the shuttle on the way back (one day after our last day) as included in our room fare and previously agreed with a receptionist, another one didn’t allow to do so. In general, the feeling is that the service is insufficient for a 5 star hotel, not accommodating customers’ needs and expectations. Also, the rooms are overall nice, but not a 5 star standard at all. The curtain that can be pulled up or down in the shower, completely ruined at the bottom, the “fridge” which did not cool at all, the spa did not serve any complimentary drink when I went for a foot massage. All small things, but which give an overall feeling of “wannabe luxury”"
"25.","Eunice Tay","19","2025-07-30","5","We had a pleasant stay here and had great service from Irene and Edy (and the other staff that we didn't manage to get names of)! Room was clean and we had a free upgrade to the room with the seaview so we did not have issues noise. The breakfast buffet was quite good. Only qualm was that the staff came in to give us a welcome cake when we were out of the room, without our knowledge, which made us feel a little uncomfortable as our belongings were unpacked. Overall, great location and great stay here!"
"26.","Leo L","8","2025-11-30","1","Go to another hotel if you want to check in before 3pm. Facilities are below 5 stars level, such as no air conditioning in the gym. There is no locker in the shower room. As Erica said, I could put all of my belongings in the reception center before the room was available, however I didn’t think being naked and going to 6-floor to have a shower was a good idea."
"27.","Fauzhanni Azhima","29","2025-12-09","5","Mencapai kemewahan Meruorah Komodo Labuan Bajo butuh perjuangan indra penciuman. Dari bau pesing di gerbang KP3, langsung check-in ke kamar wangi bintang lima. The smell of success, literally. 👃✨ Menginap di Meruorah hanya karena reuni dengan kedua Tante, dari US dan Belanda setelah 7 tahun ga jumpa. Transit sebelum mereka cruising kapal Phinisi. Rendezvous actually, just to learn how to be patience and focusing on the good side. But, Di sini, mereka belajar arti sabar: sabar nahan napas pas lewat gerbang KP3 yang bau pesing, dan sabar nahan tawa pas lihat tempat sampah yang isinya tumpah ruah. Luxury life hack Labuan Bajo. 🚮🤣 Labuan Bajo: Surga bahari dengan 'sambutan' gerbang pelabuhan yang bikin hidung perih. Welcome to the real east side, Aunties! 🏝️💨 They were surprised for the price! Hahaha welcome to Labuan Bajo!"
"28.","Dave M","28","2025-10-30","5","Beautiful hotel in the center of town. Amazing rooms, great breakfast and superb roof top bar and pool. Great stay with easy access into town for bars, restaurants and shopping. Certainly a touch of luxury without the resort prices."
"29.","KA","70","2025-08-30","3","Great breakfast and nice gym and pool. But disappointed about the small plastic bottles of water in the rooms. They could refill glass bottles and provide water refilling station for guests like some of the more modern and big hotels in Bali (they can afford to make this change and be more environmentally friendly). They charged alot for a taxi up the road, more than double the cost of a taxi from other hotels (and same quality vehicle). After paying on the higher end for the accommodation you wouldn’t expect them to try and rip you off and it’s disappointing this is their mentality."
"30.","Phoebe B","39","2025-09-30","4","A little disappointing….. Sea View room on level 2 (2263) view partly obstructed by palm trees but still pretty sunset. Very noisy! People walking along the front, music, karaoke and the boats…. Those boats are super loud! Ear plugs solved the problem but be warned about the noise. Two small toilet rolls provided for 2 night stay, ran out on the 3rd morning… fridge wasn’t cooling - reception informed me they’re not meant to cool…. Interesting. Kettle didn’t work, didn’t bother asking reception as they would probably tell me kettle not meant to heat. Balcony tiny with two uncomfortable chairs with sweaty plastic cushions and NO table. Pools…. Two, tiny and freezing cold. Nice view from the pools over the harbour but only 8 (yes, EIGHT) sunbeds for the entire hotel…. First in best dressed for those - it seems if you get up early enough they’re yours for the day, just leave a book and a towel on them and you’re sorted! Go on a tour for a few hours and they’ll sit empty waiting for you to return. Staff too timid to do anything about it. So if you want to lie by the pool for a day be prepared to get up super early to secure your bed! Also, no umbrellas/shade by the pool so you can burn to your hearts desire!! The gym…. Okay equipment but no towels (just tiny face towels) and no exercise mats…. Poor. As an early riser I had to request the gym be unlocked at 5am for me - staff happily obliged but not sure why it’s not accessible 24 hours. Breakfast was nice. Overall staff are kind but there were communication issues, for the money we paid it didn’t represent good value is my feeling. We moved to the Katamaran Resort and are delighted with the hotel and room. Consider the Katamaran - similar price but a world apart in terms of service and amenities."
"31.","K. Van Ora","4","2025-07-30","5","This hotel is the absolute best. Everyone is so, so lovely and helpful (a special thank you to Irene who truly went above and beyond to give me recommendations during my stay and was so very friendly and helpful). The room was lovely, the front desk was so prompt and professional, and the hotel itself is beautiful. Bonus points for the amazing infinity pool! A+, would definitely return!"
"32.","The Travel Reviewer","51","2025-07-30","4","This is a nice property located right by the pier, so it is the perfect spot to start or end a liveaboard, but also if staying in LBJ it is a good base to walk the city. The rooms are big and modern. Service is very friendly and attentive, everyone is trying to make sure you're taken care of. Reasons to not give it 5 stars: 1) breakfast buffet was okay, but not quite as good as in other 5-star hotels; 2) WiFi absolutely sucks, which I find unacceptable in a hotel of this caliber; 3) as nice as the rooms were, they were a bit noisy, e.g. I could hear every time the upstairs people moved their furniture. Bonus points: lovely sunset from the pool area"
"33.","Elena Yfantis","17","2025-08-30","5","Very nice hotel with great facilities, especially the view from the pool and restaurant is beautiful! We loved the music at the restaurant as well. The location is great, right in the busy area with good restaurants, cafés and bars around. All the staff was so helpful and lovely, very attentive and ensured we had everything we needed. Also, the breakfast was amazing!"
"34.","Ridzuan Fook Onn Chong","13","2025-08-30","5","My wife and I had an unforgettable experience during our recent trip to Labuan Bajo. From the moment we arrived, we were captivated by the stunning panoramic views and the warm, genuine hospitality that greeted us. We checked in just as the sun was setting, and the fiery sky made for a breathtaking welcome. The staff’s sincere smiles and attentiveness made us feel instantly at home—and that warmth continued throughout our stay. Every team member we met, whether in the hallways, at breakfast, or at reception, greeted us with kindness and a cheerful attitude. It created such a joyful and welcoming atmosphere. Our room was clean, comfortable, and offered a gorgeous sea view. Waking up to that vista each morning was a highlight. While there was some noise from boats in the nearby harbour, it didn’t detract from the overall comfort and beauty of the setting. Breakfast was a daily treat! The spread included delicious Indonesian specialties and satisfying Western options. We especially loved the Korean pastries—such a delightful surprise! Standouts for us were the comforting Bubur, Tempe Goreng, and Vegetable fitters Goreng, all cooked to perfection. The breakfast staff were just as lovely, adding warmth to each morning."
"35.","Al Muatasim Al Bahlani","25","2025-09-30","4","Great Hotel with lovely location and view. If I am to visit this place again then I will stay here again. One issue that we complained to the managment and was rectified was the service level in some parts of room service. Otherwisr it is a lovely hotel."
"36.","So Young Kim","3","2025-06-30","4","The hotel is not far from the pier (5 minute walk) and there are plenty of excellent restaurants within walking distance. The staffs are extra friendly and attentive although it would be great if the housekeeping replenished my towels without being asked. The rooms are decently sized, bathroom is very clean and modern and the breakfast is okay. One recommendation is booking a car in advance for departure as there is no Grab and the hotel did not provide any assistance with finding a taxi."
"37.","Rudi Fajar","181","2025-07-30","5","Meruorah Hotel is an awesome and delightful place to stay! The location is unbeatable, right by the ocean and just a short walk to the fish market, cafés, souvenir shops, and even a mosque. I stayed in a sea view room, which was clean, well-maintained, and super relaxing. The staff and security team were friendly and helpful throughout my stay. A couple of things that could be improved: the check-in process was quite slow, and I noticed a few guests getting visibly frustrated. It might help to have a supervisor or manager present at the front desk during peak hours. Also, small requests like extra towels took a bit longer than expected. Other than that, it was a fantastic experience overall. I’ll definitely be back at Meruorah Hotel next time!"
"38.","Cynthia","82","2025-10-30","5","Kami datang untuk menikmati kopi dan snack di lobby hotel yang luas dan nyaman. Kebetulan saat itu ada paket kopi & croissant only 75 rb View nya luar biasa Service ramah, sabar dan sangat membantu.

Kamarnya bersih, dan sangat nyaman. Dari balkon roomnya kita juga dapat view laut dan bisa nikmati sunset n sunrise yg cantik. Next time kalau ke labuan bajo,so pasti will be back again...recommended banget buat liburan keluarga."
"40.","Christopher Young","8","2025-08-30","4","The hotel was very convenient to the airport and marina. This is a great location for one night before embarking on longer trips on a boat in Komodo National Park. The food at the restaurant took a long time to arrive and was not good but it filled the need. Beautiful hotel overall with comfortable rooms."
"41.","nicole seow","7","2025-06-30","5","Meruorah is a great place to stay at Labuan Bajo! Location is fantastic, super accessible to the main road where all the shops and restaurants are. Great views from the pool and lobby and the overall ambiance is relaxing and enjoyable! One downside is that there is a mosque nearby that can disrupt sleep due to the early morning calls to prayers. If you are a light sleeper, that may be a problem. However, Meruorah makes up for it by having amazing service staff! Devina from guest relations is an awesome staff. She is very helpful and friendly and always helped us with a big smile on her face :)) All the guest relation, front office staff were all very helpful and showed genuine care for us! Special mention to Faizal as well! Housekeeping was also fast when we requested for more items. Overall, Meruorah is a wonderful hotel to stay with a great location and great staff! Would definitely recommend to friends and family!"

Masjid , Cruise boat jetty, Fishermen village restaurants, convenient stores, chic cafe all within walking distance (less than 200m). Then within 500m you can reach popular Seaview dining cafes. Has its own worthy Seaview deck. Breakfast was always best time having breakfast with the view. Gym and pool is there. And cake to room every afternoon and movie theatre every night is plus plus for us."
"43.","Annn Annn","36","2025-04-30","5","Staff were very helpful, friendly, everything was great! The view here is priceless and expensive. Hotel building is sooo beautiful as well, location is in the city center where you can find most restaurants, shops, atm machines. Breakfast were very yummy too, love their bread so much. We stayed for 3 nights and everything was superb. They offer airport pickup and drop off, but they had fixed schedule, thus we arranged our own transport. However, it is around 10-15 mins drive to the airport so no issue about that. The room can be a bit noisy because it is behind the marina, and when bigger boats came and honk the horn it could be shocking. The hotel prepared earplugs, but we did not use it anyway. One thing that I could say to probably improve the hygiene (maybe not hygiene, but you know some parts of the hotel look not well maintained and old, remembering this hotel is relatively new). Oh, and I just remember that the minibar can’t keep anything cold, so it is more like a storage instead of fridge. Could be nicer if we can have proper mini fridge inside the room. Definitely will visit again soon and good value for money!!"

They created some personalised wishes on the tv making our family holiday memorable. For our wedding anniversary they made it more memorable. Notes on mirror.. bed setting etc was a surprise after long pool dip. We are not cake fan but luckily our nephew loves the cake. If there is fruits option i love fruits or fruits juice. My nephew was so happy to receive the surprise cake before we leave the hotel.and we have the teater room all for ourselves for 2 night ❤️. Very recommended."
"45.","alex susanto","2","2025-06-30","1","I booked two King Bed rooms at Meruorah Hotel for a family vacation with my small children (we have three young kids). Unfortunately, the experience was far from what we expected from a hotel of this standard. We arrived at 1:30 PM, and none of the rooms were ready. The check-in process was extremely slow and took nearly 30 minutes. The front office staff seemed unprofessional and disorganized—they didn’t seem to understand what they were doing. They informed us that check-in officially starts at 3:00 PM, so we left to have lunch while waiting. When we returned at 3:00 PM, only one room was ready. The second room, we were told, would be ready in another 30 minutes. However, it wasn’t. I kept following up, and by 5:00 PM, it still wasn’t ready. I asked the staff to please deliver the key once the room was ready, but even at 6:00 PM when I called, they initially said it still wasn’t ready—then suddenly claimed it was ready, which felt dishonest. Finally, at 6:30 PM, we received the second room key. To make matters worse, the second room was not what I booked—it did not have a King Bed as reserved. At that point, I was too exhausted to complain again, especially with the kids already tired from travel. I also realized that the first room was missing towels and a bathroom mat. I had to request towels, and they took an unreasonably long time to arrive. The housekeeping service seemed very slow, and overall, the hotel staff lacked professionalism and basic hospitality training. It appeared that they were not equipped to properly handle tourists. This was a very frustrating experience, and I will not be staying here again. Meruorah Hotel needs serious improvement in service, professionalism, and communication."

"47.","Mildred Voon","72","2025-06-30","3","If you are a light sleeper, don't choose this hotel!! Even with ear plugs (which the hotel provides), you will hear the blaring call to prayer from the mosque across the street.. At 430am. Service is also so-so, staff are helpful but don't seem to be trained well - not having the right info etc, but they are trying their best. Hotel breakfast is really good - lots of options. Great view from the restaurant and pool area. 5 Star infrastructure - beds are really comfy, hotel design looks luxe, things work - but service is 3 star at best. Location is very central, but I don't know if it's worth the noise you'll hear - from the mosque, the jetty, from the next door guest closing their door. :("
"48.","Tom Lim","10","2025-08-30","5","A luxury experience. I highly recommend to stay in Merurah Komodo Labuan Bajo because of the below reasons. First, the service by the property crew, Devina, was excellent. She has texted me 1 day before my check in date to make sure my transport are arranged and letting me know that I can contact her if I have any needs. Second was the arrangement to celebrate for my mother's birthday and they did an excellent surprise for her. With a big birthday wishes at the lobby and in room and also a birthday song from the crews. First time I see a property and crews putting in so much effort for this. Third, was the room and facilities are top notch. Fourth is the location of the property, near the pier and surrounded with lots of shops and food. A night market with just 5 mins walking distance. These are just a brief summary but you must really experience it yourself as no words can fully explain it. A big thank you to Devina and the teams for making me feel so welcomed. I will definitely stay here again if I were to visit Labuan Bajo again."
"49.","Gokul Yesodharan","138","2025-08-30","3","Tricky one to review, this. Let’s start with the pluses. Great location, and the views from the hotel are great. Facilities are very good. You could label them at par with other big name hotels. It does however fall short in some aspects: - on checking in, an upgrade was offered, but was an upsell for one day (pay the difference, and move back to original booking room after one night), which was a bit odd, as we didn’t ask for an upgrade. - on checking in, we were offered a discounted rate at breakfast, which we agreed to, and asked for it to be added to our final bill on checking out (didn’t want to pay upfront as I wanted to exchange cash and pay with cash). Front of house agreed. However the next morning, we went in for breakfast, and there was no note that a rate was agreed on, however, we by default got the Expedia silver tier benefit discount (however it was eventually a higher price than what was agreed) - While sorting the breakfast issue out, the manager was very laissez faire (and chatting with other staff about other things rather than dealing with our query with full attention - The breakfast itself was sub-par. I would recommend trying out the numerous cafes nearby that serve great breakfasts. However, the hotel is very convenient and has a great view - The upselling continued during breakfast; the spa tried to sell their overpriced services and requested a photo to prove that they had asked us to buy, which again was a bit odd - During breakfast, another came and asked us to give a 5 star Tripadvisor review. It just seemed like they were after a positive outcome via reviews rather than actually delivering excellent service - The gym is adequate, but the cross trainer didn’t work. Not too much of an issue, as the other equipment was fine - Night one was noisy due to some festival nearby, but the front desk did warn us, and they do provide earbuds - At check-in, we asked what the latest time was that we could checkout, and agreed to 1pm. However, we came in to confirm on the day of checkout, and then we were told we had to checkout at noon. However, we said 1pm was agreed, and then they honoured it - We came back to the hotel at 1250 to collect our belongings from the room, but the cards had been deactivated. However, we were able to activate them to collect our belongings I guess to sum it up, manage your expectations. If location and facilities are the biggest factors for you, this place works great. Just don’t expect uniformly high service throughout your visit!"
"50.","Orisca","17","2025-06-30","1","We chose Meruorah Hotel mainly for its central location, and in that regard, it did not disappoint. Being right in the heart of Labuan Bajo made it easy to access restaurants, shops, and the harbor. As expected in such a busy area, some outside noise was inevitable and generally acceptable. However, what we didn’t anticipate was how poorly the hotel handled that noise. The rooms had very little sound insulation, so noise from the hallway and the road was clearly audible at all hours. The early morning call to prayer from the nearby mosque was especially loud, and unfortunately, the hotel doesn’t seem to have taken adequate steps to mitigate the impact. They do offer earplugs, but only if you request them, and even then, what’s provided is cheap and uncomfortable, more of a gesture than a solution. Judging by other reviews, this is a long-standing issue, yet the hotel continues to rely on apologies rather than addressing it meaningfully. Our stay started on the wrong foot with the airport transfer, which was listed as benefit but was initially going to be charged. After we brought it up, they did arrange it free of charge. But the fact that it had to be corrected at all was frustrating. Things didn’t get better at check-in. We arrived to find no running water in the sink or toilet. Thankfully, this was fixed quickly, but it should have been checked before our arrival. Throughout our stay, we were disturbed by construction noise from upper floors, which continued daily. We tried to be understanding, but on our third morning, loud banging started before 7 AM, which was impossible to ignore. When I raised the issue at the front desk, the staff apologized and offered to move us. However, since it was already our last night, the offer felt too late to be of any help. What’s most disappointing is that they knowingly placed us in a room affected by ongoing construction, without any prior notice or attempt to prevent the inconvenience. That same morning brought further disruption: two power outages and a drop in water pressure made it a stressful and unpleasant start to the day. These basic utility issues should not be happening in a hotel that claims a five-star rating. There were no hand or face towels in our room, and when we requested them, the ones provided were heavily worn and in poor condition, certainly not up to the standard expected at this price point. While most of the staff we interacted with were polite and courteous, we did feel the receptionist seemed disinterested and disengaged. That kind of attitude only added to the sense that the hotel is not invested in its guests’ comfort or satisfaction. In the end, while the location is excellent, the experience as a whole was disappointing. The constant noise, poor maintenance, unreliable utilities, and lack of attention to detail do not reflect a true five-star property. We left feeling let down and will not be returning. I would recommend considering other accommodations in the area."
"51.","Way Yeoh","11","2025-06-30","3","The nicest hotel around the area. Great location and clean rooms. However service overall was lacking. We had told them several times it was a birthday celebration but we did not get a greeting nor a standard slice of cake that most hotels provide. There were some other small details could've been improved. It is a 5 star hotel, for the price per room I expect better"

However, there were a few things on which the hotel missed the mark: 1. The receptionist advised there would be a 100k IDR charge if I lost one of the plastic RfId keys. I have never heard of any hotel charging for a key since most changed to electronic keys more than 25 years ago. 2. First night no hand or face towels were provided. I had to call twice before 3. Second and third night there were no towels in the room. I had to call twice before receiving towels both nights Meruorah has 5-star location, views and ambiance with 3-star service."

"56.","IDK","11","2025-07-30","1","For more context, I've lived in hotels traveling non stop the last 3 years every single day. During this time, I've stayed in super exclusive 5* hotels such as in UAE and also pretty bad 2* ones too. I arrived from a 4 day boat trip and came with no reservation seeing some rooms available on both booking and the hotel's website and the hotel was close to the port so I decided not to book online and just go in person. I was there at 2:40pm. First I waited 25 min standing next to the desk chatting with a staff member about it. He was trying to figure out whether they have a room for me or not and what the price is. 25 min I kid you not. He couldn't figure it out. So I suggested that I can still book it online. He said ok. So I did. Then I had to wait 20 min in full uncertainty whether the reservation happened or not (I paid online too). Eventually it worked but imagine how frustrated I was. In the last 3 years I did plenty of last second reservations like this and I've never experienced such a level of cluelessness. I don't want to put the blame entirely on the staff member, I think it's much more part of the system that they have but at 5* level it's absolutely unacceptable. Imagine you are paying for 21h of your stay in the place and want comfort and convenience but you waste 1h standing there like a tool. Room itself is nice. So is the view. Wifi is mediocre at best which is also unacceptable. I had a similarly reliable one between islands in the middle of nowhere so also this should be improved. (I had to switch to mobile hotspot for 45min straight around 8pm) For this price and people who value comfort, I wouldn't recommend it all. I regret spending 10x more than an average stay price in this city to be met with the worst service experience I've had in the last 3 years."

"60.","Alessio Valentino Pelella","18","2025-07-30","3","The expectations were much higher than the attention and service received. First of all the transfer from the airport was bad organised: we waited and lost one hour. The drink service outdoor near the pool was quite bad: we ordered 2 drinks and they delivered only one; then after 10 minutes I personally went asking and they had lost the care to inform me that the drink was not available anymore. The majority of employees do not speak or understand English, which is quite a surprise in a 5 star defined hotel. Also the room did not have any TV service due to a general problem. After complaining at the reception about all of above, nothing has been done, demostrating the quite debedable hotel managing. It could have been many coincidences, however overall the service experience was very poor. At least the breakfast was good with many options. The location and the view from the swimming pool are very nice; regarding the sunset: keep in mind that during the local winter months (around June) the geometry is not the best (still nice but not wonderful as other places)."

The Bed and pillows are comfortable. Our seaview room has a great view of Port Labuan Bajo. For some people, it can be a bit noisy at night with boats travelling. They provide an earplug but only for 1 guest so i think each room should have 2 earplugs. The service is also amazing. We've been taken care and had a good conversation with the restaurant manager Mr Obi and Pastry & Bakery Chef Mr Yudi. Other staffs & hostesses are also very friendly. The food is good enough with improvement should be made on it's variety. The rooftop pool has a good size & a great view, but can get very warm in the afternoon. Morning time is the best time to swim for sure. The location is right at the city center, so we can just walk to the fish market and port. We'll come back to stay at Meruorah for sure when we go to Labuan Bajo."

Shoutout to Sam in the breakfast staffing as well for making all the incredible detox juices and amazing lattes! <3 Usually the staff would ask how our stay was at the end of the trip upon check-out which typically would be too late to amend anything or worth saying anything but Devina took the time to approach us with this question at breakfast on our first morning there which took our group by surprise but really appreciative of her service. There were a couple of amenities there were not working well in our room, she got her team to immediately action them which was delightful. Our group had a scrub spa in-house at the hotel which was reasonably priced and their service was too impeccable.

"68.","Matt Ball","9","2025-06-30","1","Don’t book it. Spend the extra cash and go to AYANA Komodo Waecicu Beach. It’s 100% worth it! The hotel itself is average—very similar to a lower quality Hampton Inn in terms of comfort and amenities. The staff was friendly, the room was somewhat clean, and the location is excellent for accessing downtown and walking to dinner. But don’t be fooled—this is not a 5-star resort, or anything close to it. It’s comfortable, but very, very basic. However, a major downside is the proximity to a mosque with loudspeakers for the call to prayer. While we respect the local culture, the first call begins around 4:30 AM and is extremely loud—impossible to sleep through—and lasts nearly 45 minutes. This happens five times a day and significantly affected our ability to rest. Unfortunately, it disrupted our trip enough that we ended up booking a different hotel. If you’re a light sleeper or value quiet in the early morning, book somewhere else!"

We asked on some questions when we check in, they said they will come back to us yet until the 3rd day we checking out, nobody came back to us.

"84.","ef 2 point eight","373","2025-06-30","2","Other than Devina from the main reception, it was a very amateur experience. When I had the do not disturb sign on the door, they would call everyday to tell me they did not enter the room because of the sign on the handle. I know. I put it there. On a few occasions when ordering room service, they would ring the doorbell and then literally within 3 seconds ring it again. I did ask the why? On one day the battery ran out of door lock and I could not access my room. I asked the breakfast restaurant to tell this to the reception so they could resolve it while having breakfast. When I was done and I asked the lady what happened, she looked like she had forgotten. It took 30 minutes for the guy to come change the battery. I was late for a group trip. At breakfast, I asked for only salt and pepper in my omlette, she even verbally confirmed salt and pepper only sir?. I said yes. There was none. When I asked, she said she forgot. Then the other day she did put but turned out the holes in the salt and pepper shaker were clogged and therefore nothing was coming out. I would not use the bathroom towels to clean my car. Rough like sand paper. When they did the room service, they did not replace the hand and face towels. Why? You are paying a lot for amateur service. Either hire professional staff or lower your prices. Its a beautiful hotel though. Nice bright lobby with views of the bay. Large open windows. A Koi pond. Clearly there was a theme to the architecture with the curved panels. Just wish it was professional - priced aptly."

You’re super close to restaurants (even a KFC), cafes (there is Starbucks), massage places (super affordable), dive shops, supermarkets and tour agencies, which made getting around and planning stuff really easy. AND, there is a MIXUE just a few minutes away! The room was clean, spacious, and comfy, with a view that made it hard to leave in the morning. The staff were also super friendly and helpful throughout the stay, always ready to assist or give suggestions on things to do.

Gw tau bagaimana simplenya ketika pake motor biasa, gw tau ketika praktisnya gw disopirin turun di lobby, dan gw tau hari ini gw pake moge. Melek kalian akan object. Jika memang kebijakan seperti itu buat para bikers moge lintas flores..jangan nginap disini"

"89.","Kevin Wesa","35","2025-05-30","5","Really nice harbour front hotel. Staff were ALL friendly and helpful - they all went above and beyond. We stayed 2 nights and then went for a boat trip. On our return, they had made welcome back decorations in our room - on our bed and on a wall mirror. They definitely went the extra distance. The breakfast was great. My wife had a massage treatment at the spa and felt great the next day. There was an infinity pool on the 6th floor that looked really nice. It was very convenient to get to the harbour for our Komodo boat trip. The harbour view from our 5th floor room was wonderful with all the big wooden tour boats. There is a bit of noise from the fishing boats as they pass by but this is part of the atmosphere. When booking, make sure you get the harbour front view as it is amazing. Five star review well deserved."
"90.","Aveline Agrippina Tando","196","2025-04-30","5","Strategic location in the mid of Labuan Bajo. Not too difficult to be reached from airport or central. Great room, esp the Horizon Sea View type. (I have been here twice, and the lower class one is too narrow). Excellent service from all the staffs, from check-in to check-out. They even provided me very early check-in at 11am, as a great service, and dropped my luggages to room while I was walking around Soekarno Hatta street. Moreover, they also have great breakfast and tasty menu. Plus point and hacky way that I did: more and more bonus while I booked via their direct website, such as airport shuttle, afternoon tea during stays, and some perks. Hence, affordable cost for staying here - while you love eating outside, shopping, and sleeping at the same time like me. Just a small input - they need to check more often about the bathroom aminities and refrigerators. I found the same issue in refrigerators in my last visit. Otherwise, surely will come back later, when I want to enjoy Labuan Bajo. Anyway, thanks to celebrating my birthday earlier!"

"94.","B N","4","2025-04-30","2","Self claimed 5 star hotel at the Central of Labuan Bajo. Walking distance to the ferry and food stores/ dive shops. Clean and good amenities. “Swimming pool” is a short strip dip pool right next to the restaurant, but nice view to sunset. ‼️before booking, consider if you can accept poor sound proof. Close proximity to mosque with 4:20-50am morning calls. Then 6pm and 8pm. On busy streets you can also hear loud music and beats from nearby bar, everyday from 6pm until late. The hotel provides ear plugs but isn’t it absurd when a 5 star requires you the visitor to bend by when you’re paying premium prices? Management passive about the situation despite multiple poor reviews on Google. Real feedback, I would prefer paying slightly more for further locations to stay… tours usually start really early and the sound made poor rest everyday that I was here. Disappointing."
"95.","Marius Aucamp","61","2025-04-30","1","The overall experience was not particularly satisfactory, as the air conditioning in the room was malfunctioning. It took a considerable amount of time for the staff to acknowledge the issue before arranging a room change. The personnel were amiable and the staff provided excellent service, including an airport shuttle as part of the fare. However, I rented a scooter for exploration, which led to a significant inconvenience. I was required to park in the basement, which necessitated a lengthy walk to another section of the hotel, because the closest door to the elevator was locked, passing through debris, construction materials, and heat, as the nearest elevator was inaccessible from the basement. I brought this matter to the attention of the manager, who was unable to provide a rationale or explanation for the locked door. It is regrettable that common sense did not prevail to unlock the door, thereby enhancing the experience for guests parking in the basement. A similar situation arose when attempting to walk from the hotel to the marina. Despite the existence of a direct pathway, it was locked, compelling us to take a longer route through the front lobby and adjacent shops, rather than utilizing the convenient stairs and pathway designed to facilitate navigation through the hotel, shops, and marina. Again, there was no apparent reason for the pathway's closure, other than to inconvenience guests. The breakfast buffet was also disappointing, with subpar bread options that seemed stale and a lack of meat choices, such as sausages or beef bacon. However, the coffee was quite good. In conclusion, while the experience was not entirely negative, the unnecessary inconveniences warrant attention from management, as they are easily remedied. I would consider returning to this hotel, but I hope that improvements are made in the future. I'm sorry for giving a 1star review but I guess that's the only way you can improve."

"99.","Vishnupriya Naidu","35","2025-05-30","4","Service - 10/10 Location - 10/10 Rooms - 8/10 Noise Levels - 0/10 This hotel is nice, new and conveniently located beside the Jetty. This is especially good for people who have trips to Komodo departing early, as we can make our way to the jetty within 5 minutes. The view is also exceptional. The hotel room itself was musky, but i think this comes with being so close to the sea. I wouldn't complain too much. Still does the job. While the noise from the mosque is not caused by the hotel in any way, this is completely disruptive for someone trying to catch a good night's rest after a tiring day of diving/island hopping etc. The prayer calls start as early at 4.30am (goes on for 15 mins) and then another at 6am (also goes on for 15 mins). I was at the room furthest away from the speaker and yet each morning I jolted up. I guess this can't be helped but please take note if you are a light sleeper. Ear plugs provided by the hotel was a nice touch, but wasn't very helpful. The hotel provided an option to upgrade to a sea view room for 400K IDR per night, but quite honestly, it wouldn't have made much difference given how loud the noise was. Will definitely return, but maybe try the sea view room as far from the mosque speakers as possible."

That said, I would definitely not consider this hotel a 5-star hotel and it’s fairly over-priced for the area and for what you get. There aren’t really any amenities, tiny pool, gym is only a few treadmills in a room, no place to buy drinks or food unless it’s during breakfast or dinner time…It’d be nice to be able to get a water or snack if hanging out at the pool and not have to leave and walk to a corner store"

The room was very clean, daily house keeping . The toilet however, had stains which most probably accumulated over time. The breakfast spread was good enough but the quality could have been better individually. The gym and pool is just “there”. Gym is lacking of equipment for a 5 star hotel. Overall, I felt that the hotel has so much potential due to where it is located. The exterior looked amazing but the interior was off. The staff were all very polite and accommodating."

I highly recommend booking your spa session around sunset—you'll get to enjoy a rejuvenating treatment while witnessing one of the most stunning sunsets imaginable. If you're visiting, don’t miss out on the Meruorah Signature Massage—it’s a must-try! Will definitely come back again. 🌅✨"

The location is a big plus—right in a prime spot with the fish market, cafe, and shops just a short walk away, making dinner plans easy and delicious. However, the gym was quite small, and unfortunately, the AC was broken during our stay. Also, if you’re planning to visit in February, keep in mind that it’s the rainy season, and they remove all the lounge chairs—even if the weather is sunny. We had no lounging spots, which was a bit disappointing. Overall, it’s a great place to stay, but I’d recommend coming after February to enjoy all the amenities fully!"

"112.","Adib Brilian Muhammad","7","2025-03-30","5","Pengalaman yang sangat mengecewakan menginap di meruorah labuan bajo. Mungkin ekspektasi kami sekeluarga yang terlalu tinggi untuk hotel bintang lima ini di labuan bajo : 1. Kami menginap untuk tanggal 28-31 Maret 2025, pada saat check in dilayani oleh Bapak Andy (kalau tidak salah). Kami memesan 2 kamar di 2028 dan 5038, include breakfast. 2. Pada saat check in kami SUDAH MEMBERITAHUKAN BAHWA KAMI MUSLIM DAN BERPUASA dan sudah di request menu breakfast jam 4 pagi diantar ke kamar. 3. Pada saat malam pertama menginap kami mendapat kiriman breakfast jam 4 pagi untuk sahur. 4. Pada malam kedua , jam 4 kami bangun. Tidak ada breakfast yang diantar ke kamar. Pada saat telp receptionist dijawab bapak tidak request untuk sahur hari ini, Kecewa aja sih untuk hari ini, terlebih kami menginap lebih dari 2 malam. 5.sampai dengan 30 maret 2025 jam 04.41tidak ada permintaan maaf/kompensasi atas hal tersebut. Saya tunggu sd saya check out. 6. Kecewa sekali dengan pelayanan hotel bintang lima ini, tidak ada konfirmasi ulang telp ke kamar/telp ke nomer HP saya. 7. Sekian dan Terimakasih. Tidak akan kembali untuk yg kedua kali. 8. Terlampir menu sahur saya dari hotel bintang lima di labuan bajo Sudah di respon dengan baik oleh Bu Irene selaku manajer hotel. Terimakasih.

"115.","Ayu Melinda","10","2025-05-30","5","Our recent birthday celebration at Meruorah was nothing short of spectacular, an experience we wholeheartedly recommend. From the moment we arrived, the commitment to exceptional service was evident. We were delighted to be offered an early check-in, a seamless process thanks to the wonderfully friendly and attentive Ericka, who even took the time to suggest local Labuan Bajo attractions. We were utterly captivated by our Signature Sea View room. The immaculate cleanliness and tidiness were immediately noticeable, and the ocean view from our balcony was simply breathtaking – a truly stunning backdrop to our special occasion. The hotel's excellent facilities further elevated our stay, providing every comfort and convenience. Dining at Meruorah was a delight, particularly breakfast. The spread was both varied and delicious. We were warmly welcomed by Chef Yudi, who graciously prepared a special French toast for us, a thoughtful touch that truly stood out. Mr. Adi and Mr. Putu also ensured a warm and inviting start to our mornings with their genuine greetings. However, the true highlight of our stay, and what made our birthday celebration so profoundly memorable, was the extraordinary service provided by Ms. Devina. Her daily attention to our needs was impeccable, and her coordination of a magnificent birthday surprise was truly touching. The beautiful room decorations, expertly executed with the help of Ericka and Safri, along with the delicious birthday cake and the thoughtful display of our photo in the lobby, demonstrated a level of care and personalization that exceeded all expectations. Thank you, Meruorah, for crafting such a meaningful and unforgettable birthday experience. We are eager to return at the next opportunity and will undoubtedly be recommending your exceptional hospitality to all."

"121.","Amol Kothari","10","2024-12-30","1","The low rating is for the food department, who are unable to follow simple dietary restrictions that are advertised on their menu, and hotel administration who is unable/unwilling to find a reasonable resolution. The property (esp the views) and general staff that helps you were really great, no complaints about them! We had ordered 4 packed vegetarian breakfasts worth 900K, (Menu B vegetarian option), since we were going on a cruise at 6:30 am, and had specific instructions for no egg. On the cruise we found that the vegetarian noodles had chicken in them, and the fried rice had egg, which killed our appetite, and left us hungry given lack of eating options given the cruise sails in remote areas. On getting back, the hotel administration offered a dinner service to makeup for it, but we wanted to try other local restaurants with more vegetarian options, so declined. They also offered an airport drop-off service, which we declined since we had a taxi booking. I instead asked to compensate for 2 breakfasts (worth 450K) that we paid & billed separately for our kids, and anything more they could do, to make up for the other 450K, which I think is the absolute minimum to simply makeup for the value of the bad breakfast (not accounting for any inconvenience). They did call again at night, but we missed the call (not sure what the manager was offering). At checkout in the morning, I was in a hurry, asked them to compensate for 2 breakfasts (450K) and some of our in-room dining which we had on the last night (atleast 450K of our dining). This time the hotel administration (some other person), said the breakfast and food had already been billed, so they could not reverse it. To me this is a sign of not wanting to resolve the issue, given both the grievance and resolution were for the food. Having traveled widely, I know even the most basic hotels would have resolved this. It’s a shame this soured the mood on an otherwise great experience with the property and their staff."

Conveniently located besides the harbour. The price is quite reasonable for what is offer. The buffet breakfast was delicious with a huge variety of options (Indonesian, Asian and Western dishes). Chef Yudi came to each table every morning to make sure everything was good. Every morning he came to us and asked us how was our diving the day before. A true gentleman. The staff at the restaurant, Obi, Sony and Jeni, true professionals, making sure every lunch and dinner was served to perfection suggesting the best options and going the extra mile to make us feel happy and welcome. Their sweet smiles and kindness were greatly appreciated. The room was spotless, with modern decoration, beautiful bathroom and a super comfortable bed.

"128.","Jennifer Hanea","5","2024-12-30","1","ATTENTION! We stayed for 4 nights and it was simply horrible! My sister and I were so happy when leaving this place. But why? First of all the prices in this hotel are too high for what you are actually getting for the service. The food in the restaurant has not the standard of international cuisine - however I do understand that this will or may get better over time. What's a very let down is the service of the waiter in the restaurant. You will wait a long time before getting even your bottled drinks or your food. (When we were eating there were no guests or just 2 other tables dining in.) Still, the waiter are friendly and always smiling. What A LOT of guests have mentioned is the VERY (!!!!!!) loud surrounding! No one told us in advance that there will be prayer about 6-7 times a day for minimum 30 minutes. The problem is that the mosque is next to the hotel and the prayer is transmitted per megaphones - so you will hear the prayer in the whole town but especially in your hotel room. When the prayer started it was like you are outside listening to it. The hotel has zero sound proofing. The worst thing is the ship that starts to honk several times every night around midnight. (The prayers start very early around 4 o'clock.) They will also charge you for the transfer to the airport with 225k IDR! (The drive from the hotel to the airport are just around 7 Minutes!!!!!!) That's a total scam! When arriving to the airport we just had to pay around 70k for the transfer with a local taxi. When we heard how much they were charging for ONE drive for about 7 min. I wanted called a bunch of local taxi companies but they all said to me that my hotel has airport transfer and they will not pick us up! That's very shady and a frightening. This trip was just expensive and getting on my nerves! I do not recommend at all!!"

"134.","Merinda Khoe","73","2024-12-30","4","The location of this hotel was incredibly fantastic. It was very walkable to go to the harbor or just walk around for cafes or restaurants. Moreover, loving the concept of this hotel. Either for cost effectivity or sustainable environment (or both!) they only activated 1 lift (since not too many people), few small lights and the design of this hotel was semi-open for some areas, hence the light apparently came inside (so no lamps or electricity are needed) Which was excellent! 👍 The view from the lobby was also a stunner. So beautiful and they also put so many sofas and tables. The service was also great! The receptionist always deliver what we requested. The thing that could’ve been better, 1. The mirror in the room: would be better if they put the mirror not only in the bathroom But the bedroom and bathroom was decent and comfortable. 2. Some of the tiles were not in a perfect condition, not a major issue. 3. Lounge and swimming pool area : the lounge was lovely and we could see sunset from up there, however there was something a bit off with the design of the swimming pool, with a large area they could have more spacious swimming pool. Overall, we enjoyed our stay due to the location and view from the lobby (was amazing and beautiful)"

From reception, security, housekeeping and to the restaurant staff, every single one of them was focused on the customer needs and doing the work with a smiling and friendly demeanor. I could hardly find any fault at all during my entire 2 nights stay. Fast check-in, great suite, outstanding location and views, and amazing restaurant (both ala carte and breakfast buffet)."

The big downside here is not the hotel, but the neighboring Mosque with unpleasant loud chanting in the morning. (Volume is really, really loud) This really puts a negative shadow over the hotel for us as it will wake you up every morning at 04:00. The hotel cannot do anything about this of course but keep into consideration if night rest is of importance to you. Or bring good earplugs ;)"

"146.","Lionheart77","11","2024-12-30","4","The structure is well maintened and the staff is very helpful and gentle. Overall the service is very good and the pros are a well prepared breakfast and the central position in Labuan Bajo. The great problem is caused by the very near vicinity with the local mosque that starts the chants at 4.00 in the night with an absurd high volume. The earplugs that the staff will leave in your room can't help in any way to reduce the sound. This is a problem that in reality will affect all the hotels in the area. My only advice if you decide to stay here, is absolutely to reserve a room in the marina side even if you will gonna pay that more!"

Our group spent two nights here for meetings and exploring the nearby islands, and we couldn’t have asked for a better base. The rooms were spacious, beautifully designed, and offered stunning views of the ocean. The staff went above and beyond to accommodate our needs, making our meetings seamless. After our activities, we enjoyed the hotel's relaxing atmosphere and delicious dining options. Its proximity to Komodo Island's attractions made our adventures hassle-free. Highly recommended for both business and leisure stays!"

"149.","Youssef el Berrah","102","2024-12-30","3","The good: Nice looking hotel on walking distance of the marina which why we chose it. Beautiful lobby overlooking the boats but very warm (no ventilators). All staff is very friendly. Great view from our room facing the marine. The bad: Shower is cold in the morning unless you run the hot water for at least ten minutes. No protection for the sun at the pool beds. Service in the restaurant is horrible: waited 20min for a double shot of whiskey with ice in an empty restaurant. They then showed up with two glasses of single shot? Can you imagine how bad service is when busy? Staff hardly speaks English and seems untrained. Internet in the room is fast but unreliable/inconsistent. Gym is very small and limited. Last but not least: VERY NOISY. Woke up every morning because of furniture being moved around on the 6th floor. We were right beneath it. If you decide to stay here, make sure you are in the other wing facing north."

The hotel's location is ideal, situated right in the heart of Labuan Bajo with easy access to the harbor and local attractions. The rooms were spacious, clean, and beautifully decorated, providing a comfortable retreat after a day of exploring. The breathtaking views of the ocean from the room and the rooftop made each moment truly special. One of the highlights of my stay was the delicious seafood options available nearby, just steps away from the hotel. It was a culinary delight to savor fresh seafood dishes at affordable prices. The staff at Meruorah Komodo went above and beyond to ensure that my stay was memorable. Their attention to detail and willingness to assist with any request truly exceeded my expectations. Overall, I cannot recommend Meruorah Komodo Labuan Bajo highly enough. Whether you're visiting for adventure or relaxation, this hotel is the perfect choice. I look forward to returning in the future!"

"152.","Lindsey Ong","36","2024-12-30","1","The hotel has no sound proofing and is very noisy from the ships all night - whether they are honking or motor sound from moving along the bay. Multiple IT card issues to the room which needed resetting. We had booked transport from the airport to the hotel at 250k but no one showed up to pick us up. We ended up taking a taxi for 70k. We also ordered a tea at breakfast which never appeared. I ordered fish for dinner and it was still raw and not fully cooked when it arrived. Small pool and only a few sun loungers. We returned from lunch at 3pm and our room was still not made up. Even when we requested from reception to make up the room, it took them > 1 hour. This is our honeymoon and we are staying here a couple of nights before going diving - disappointing and choose somewhere else. Bring ear plugs!"

Strategic location which is close to the port and the restaurants. There is a shopping center right next to the hotel where there is Starbucks and some other stores. The view is breathtaking and it has adequate amount of facilities. The breakfast has many options and some of them are suitable for vegetarians. Some low points of this hotel is the service. The check-in was really slow and the reception didn’t have any first aid box for emergencies. However, the service at the restaurants in the hotel is good. The infinity pool is the icing on the cake but I hope they will add more facilities to the gym. Overall, it’s a no-brainer hotel for Labuan Bajo."

They go out of their way to make you feel welcome and taken care of. And that view, just wow. The cherry on top is the location. It's a walk away from the famous fish market where they cook fresh seafood for you and it's a 10 minute ride to the port where you board for island tours."
"157.","Bobby Meers","12","2025-01-30","1","Location is good that is near the harbour, you can easily walk to the harbour and take boats to Komodo and snorkelling trips. However, hotel is unprofessional and overpriced for the quality it gave. The hotel quality is equivalent for its price. We were expecting more. But hugely disappointed by it."
"158.","Anastasia Wahyuni","30","2024-12-30","3","I was disappointed by my stay here. We stayed for 4 nights in Meruorah - my partner and I booked a sea view room as well as a village view room for my mom. Yes, the lobby is stunning, and you quickly learn that that, the views, and the location are the best parts of the hotel. Everything else is so off and not worth the price they charge. My biggest issue is the staff. Don’t expect the kind of concierge that will help right away you when you need something, like help with laundry or bringing up a kettle to your room. Instead, they will make you do the work of contacting 3 different people to figure out what’s going on, instead of figuring it out internally themselves. On our last night, our AC wasn’t working and our rooms were very hot. We were feeling frustrated because this was one of the more expensive hotels we booked during our trip. We had to call the front office multiple times during the hour and they didn’t have any clear answers or directives. Finally, we suggested being moved to a different room. It was then they revealed that the whole floor was experiencing AC issues so they eventually moved us. The bathroom was really dark. Because we booked two types of rooms, I realized that ONLY TWO LIGHTS in our sea view bathroom was working. One above our sink and one in the shower. Having seen my mom’s room, I realized that our mirror light, the light above the toilet, and underneath the sink were all not working. I called staff to help fix the situation, and they only fixed the mirror light, which was also dim and didn’t help brighten the room much more. I don’t get the shutter being in the shower bc there was mold all over the bottom. The glass railing on our balcony wasn’t safe to lean on???? Which seemed to me like they were cutting costs bc on the rooftop, you could tell the quality of glass and construction were different. Despite having a pool and ocean tours all around them, they didn’t provide any racks on our balcony to hang up our bathing suits, while also putting signs on our railings prohibiting us from hanging our clothes on them. This shows me a lack of thought in their customer experience design. No soundproofing on the windows at all despite the loud surroundings - another sign of cost cutting. Yes, the boats and calls to prayer were loud and that’s something they could have designed more properly for. The breakfast has many options but like others I do question the quality. One afternoon, we sat in the dining area for some drinks. After 15 minutes of waiting, no one came up to take our drinks order so we just gave up. The pool area felt so cramped. The hotel was built for looks and I think they skimped on important aspects of the design and overlooked essential guest needs. The staff needs to be better trained. Try a night at meruorah for the sunset but then stay elsewhere."

There is ZERO sound proofing - they are directly across from a sort of military base that blasts sirens and songs at 5AM. The shower water didn’t get more than lukewarm and the sink water wouldn’t even get past room temperature. The lobby is gorgeous but I think it’s the only aspect that is 5 stars."
"164.","Phoebe Dewing","10","2023-12-30","4","Had a lovely two night stay at the Meruorah hotel, we’d moved to this hotel as we wanted to be more in town. It’s certainly a very good location, short walk to all the restaurants on the main strip of Labuan Bajo. The welcome to the hotel was very pleasant with lots of friendly smiles. I would like to really highlight **Ronald** who was working on the door/valet. He stayed and talked to us for a whole 30 minutes whilst we waited to be collected for our tour. He was such a lovely gentleman, spoke very good English, and genuinely wanted to talk to us. We were offered a welcome drink, which we excitingly accepted as we hoped it would be a cold beer. However, on arrival to the bar on the top floor we found it was actually a local concoction comprising of coconut and some sort of jelly(?), whilst not unpleasant we certainly would have preferred this to have been a beer! We didn’t have time to dip in the pool but it looked clean and pleasant with a few lounge chairs around it. We also didn’t have time to visit the gym but it looked well equipped when we popped our heads inside, although I don’t think there was air con so that could get sweaty quickly…! The rooms were very comfortable, a good size and very clean. The bed was also extremely comfortable. Plenty of toiletries were provided. Negatives were the price didn’t include a breakfast, and it seemed a lot of money to add this on so we went out to eat instead. The bathroom towels could have been a bit bigger. Also, although not technically the hotel’s fault we had two really poor night sleep due to the construction work next door going on til around 11pm, followed by the call to prayer from the mosque at 4am, followed by the police academy across the road practicing their whistle salutes around 7am… We had the option to come back for one more night after our boat trip but decided to go to another hotel that was further out of LB which we knew was going to give us a quieter night."

The staff is hospitable, but only a few can communicate in English very well. The negatives are its location (yes), the rooms are next to the marina so there is constant sounds from boats' engines. Also, there is a mosque next to the hotel so you hear the prayers every few hours and for hours in the evening on Friday night. It is a good hotel for stay for one night, if you want a peaceful retreat then probably look at the hotels outside the city center."

Jadi buat para traveler muslim, hotel sangat recommended karena bisa subuhan berjamaah setiap pagi.. masjid besar yg bersih disponsori BSI hanya berjarak sekitar 2-3 menit jalan kaki. Ada catatan kecil, semoga saja pihak hotel bisa memperbaiki SOP. Ceritanya, hari kedua saya ke Laut, sewa Boat, udah telpon minta sarapan dikotakin (at least pastry dkk), katanya bisa, eh pas ke datang ke restoran ribet bener, saya tinggal aja.. pas ke Boat karena kapalnya bersandar di sebelah hotel ada jalan dibukain, eh pas sorenya balik pintunya dikunci suruh masuk lewat luar shg jalan muter, karena sedang capek jadi terasa mengganggu… pas baru sampai kamar ternyata kamar belum dibersihkan (padahal udah jam 4 lewat), kita baru rebahan tiba-tiba datang petugas room service, karena memang pengen rapih dan ganti handuk ya sudahlah.. padahal lagi capekcapeknya… walau petugasnya ramah , kayaknya manajemen perlu memperbaiki SOP, karena seharusnya paham psikologi dan kebiasaan tamu hotel… O iya satu lagi, saya kebetulan bersama 2 anak kecil umur 4 dan 6 tahun, keduanya malas main di Kids corner-nya yg di lt6, karena tdk menarik"

It is an abuse.The room is noisy, dirty (photos of the windows and bathroom), and nowhere near worth the price paid. I asked to speak to the hotel manager, and it's impossible. There are always excuses: he's not here, he's in a meeting, he'll be here in 30 minutes, etc... but he never shows up or addresses a customer’s complaint. The only good thing about the hotel is the location; the rest is really bad."

"171.","Peter Harding","2","2024-12-30","1","I have travelled extensively throughout south-east Asia for more than 30 years and this is the worst hotel experience I have ever endured. We had two rooms booked, dropped our bags at 2pm, and went for a late lunch. At 3pm, only one room was ready which we went to, the bathroom was covered in mould and smelt awful - photo attached. We returned to reception and complained that the room was unacceptable and a health hazard, with little response. We were patient until 5:30pm, when reception and management had failed to provide alternative rooms, as they were still not clean. The management had pre-charged our credit card when we arrived, we are still waiting for a refund some 2 months later, as we cancelled the booking and stayed at another hotel. The staff were appalling, and when we pressed them for better service to address our accommodation issues, they became rude and unhelpful. Do not stay here it is a dump beyond the main foyer. The operators and their management should be removed from hospitality, they are giving tourism in Flores and Labuan Bajo a bad name."

"173.","Stella W","15","2024-12-30","1","Disappointing Experience at Meruorah Hotel. The hotel's customer service really fell short for a five star hotel. If you're looking for a nice hotel that would offer peace of mind in case unexpected situations happen, I’d look elsewhere (keep in mind you're gonna be in a small town with barely any facilities). I had a much better experience with another five star resort that honestly is not way more expensive, not to mention also has a better facilities, restaurants, and view than this (I've been to Labuan Bajo twice before this happened). I was supposed to stay there on Nov 10 2024. Unfortunately, on the day of, my flight was canceled because the Labuan Bajo airport was closed due to a volcanic eruption and it was impossible for me to get there. I called the hotel asking if it's possible to get a refund or any hotel credit for a future stay as this is an unforeseen circumstance due to a natural disaster. In general they seemed unconcerned and unprepared to handle unexpected situations. They just told me they can't do anything and to call the reservation team instead. I tried calling the reservation teams with the number they gave me four times over the course of two hours and no one ever answered. At this point I decided to try again later as it was a Sunday, so I thought maybe their office was closed. I tried calling again the next day and still no answer. Finally, I emailed the hotel on Tuesday, explaining everything and recapping my attempt to contact them. Again, they were very unsympathetic and not helpful. They told me because they were not informed before the check-in date that I was no longer coming, I was marked as a no-show in the system and they were not able to do anything for me. To that: 1) There was no way for me to know the airport was gonna be closed. 2) I had called the hotel on the day of to inform them that the airport was closed (which they already should have been aware, to be honest) 3) I tried to call their reservations team five times with no luck. For comparison, the liveaboard operator and the other resort I had planned for this trip both offered to rebook me for next year. It's ironic because my reservation for Meruorah was supposed to be refundable up until a certain date, while both the liveaboard and the other resort were non-refundable and non-changeable, but they were still much more understanding of the situation and accommodating. Even the hotel I ended up booking in Bali for that night upgraded me to a better room after they heard about what had happened. Now if you really don't care about customer service and you're 100% sure nothing unexpected is going to happen during your trip, the property itself is not bad. My first stay there was alright as nothing unexpected happened which is also why I thought I would stay there one more time before my liveaboard trip. However, as I mentioned before, I've stayed at two different properties before in Labuan Bajo. Meruroah is a nice hotel but nothing to write home about. It has a nice view especially during sunset but so do most other hotels in Labuan Bajo. Some will even have better views as Meruorah is located at sea level while some other ones are located higher. I'd probably give them four stars if it's not because of this entire experience but I can't recommend them anymore after what happened. Side note: I'm not entirely sure why, I emailed them in English and for some reason they responded to me in Indonesian. Fortunately, I do speak Indonesian fluently, but I was surprised when I got the response. Just a heads up for those who might not speak Indonesian."

Earplus are being handed, but who wants to use earplugs in a 5 Star hotel. - In the bathroom is a roller blind for privacy. Because that part is directly in the shower cabin, of course there is mold. Terrible design from the architect. If anything; that roller blind has to be outside the shower cabin to prevent mold. - when arrived mini bar wasn’t cooling. In total a nice hotel, with 2 critical design flaws, that are unacceptable especially for the steep price (175€/night without breakfast)"

"177.","Dovile Vitonyte","35","2024-12-30","2","This place was an absolutely terrible experience: 1. Sooo noisy! Forget about getting any sleep in this place as the sound proofing is non existent. Sliding balcony doors have no sound isolation so you get all street noise, doors to the hall also have no proofing and you can hear every guest that comes and go to the rooms. Also hall is just an outside because there are no walls at the end so you get street noise there too. However the worst thing is that at 23:00, 23:30 and at midnight a massive ship honks its horn so that whole island is aware of its presence. If you try to sleep during this hour better don’t bother otherwise you will jump in the bed not understanding what’s happening. Then brace yourself for morning prayer at 4:20am. Your best earplugs will be defeated and after listening to it for half an hour (yes, it goes on until 4.50 and the hotel is right next to the mosque) you will no longer be able to sleep. And then let’s just hope that you did not book yourself a tour that starts at 5.30 leaving you with 4h of sleep that you got. If you did, you will find yourself coming back from the tour and going straight for the nap just to find yourself awaken by another prayer. And you will keep repeating this routine until you leave this place. 2. Everything takes eternity in this place. We came once to the lobby to enjoy the view on the evening and asked for couple bottles of water. 20 min later we asked to check on water and staff assured us that they are bringing it. 10minutes later we lost our patience and went to the room and got the water from the room instead. We also tried the dinner at the top floor restaurant and wanted to share a bottle of red wine. After waiting for who knows how long we were told that they don’t have that wine. We asked for a different bottle instead. Again, after some time the waiter came back and said that out of 6 red wines they have only 1 available- so much for a 5* hotel… just go to the town and have your dinner there: much cheaper, better dishes and quicker service. 3. Extremely overpriced: after landing at the airport we gave a call to ask how much is transfer to the hotel. The price we were given was 250k!!! For the reference the regular taxi price is 70k. You pay around 150k in Bali to go to Seminyak which takes around 1h and the drive to this hotel is 6min. Small bottle of sparkling water here is 100k… I cannot believe that we paid so much to stay in this hotel just to get sleep deprived and be looking forward to leave this place. 4. Pool is very small for such a big place and has only 6 sun beds Some things that we liked in this misery and the reasons why I give 2* instead of 1*: Nice view from the lobby and from the rooftop, also comfortable beds and clean room."

On top of that the shower was broken, there was mould in both room types we stayed (waterside and road side). The breakfast is fine, and the service is also but it’s way overpriced for what you’re getting. They charged us 300/400 IDR for getting a taxi 12 minutes down the road.."
"182.","maya maya","4","2024-12-30","3","I think this is the first time I’m disappointed spending a night at a 5 star hotel. When we arrived around 2 pm, the guests were already lined up in a long queue and so many people were waiting in the lobby. Understand the check-in could only started at 3 pm due to high season, so we registered our name and proceed to wait as the room was still unavailable, as per the staff request. No welcome drink, I noted. The lobby was getting more crowded, at 3pm we checked again, but still the room wasn’t ready. The receptionist helped to call the housekeeping team to prioritize our room, then gave us a voucher for a welcome drink, which was a bit funny cause a welcome drink had always been given when guests firstly arrived at the hotel freely, even in a 4 star hotel. The drink also taste like marjan. At 4pm, the room finally ready, the room was ok, with marine view, but we noticed some stains on the sheet. Understand it’s high season, I won’t blame the receptionist nor the housekeeping, but the management should review & do something to anticipate this situation, i.e. understaffs at housekeeping team maybe? The next morning, breakfast was very average in taste & food variety also limited. We get used to pay additional charges for 1 of our kids, but IDR 250K for this limited variation of menu, definitely not worth it. My child only ate 2 eggs for IDR 250K, when he usually very keen & excited to have breakfast. Pool area also quite small, with limited pool chairs. Parents with small kids need to be very attentive, as I reckon there are some dangerous spots for kids around the pool."

"185.","Amalia Suhaimi","8","2024-12-30","5","My stay at Meruorah was absolutely fantastic. Everything from the location and views to the service, room, facilities, and breakfast spread was top-notch. We used the laundry service, and our clothes were returned in less than 24 hours, crisp and clean, which was impressive given that we had just come back from several days of muddy and wet hiking in the mountains. While flying my drone from the hotel lobby's outdoor area to capture the beautiful sunset over the sea, I lost the signal and assumed it had fallen into the water. I was quite upset. However, the next day, I learned that a local had found my drone near the hotel. The hotel security had retrieved it and kept it in their lost and found, as they heard a guest had lost a drone. When I returned from my boat tour, I was thrilled to be reunited with it, thanks to the hotel's attentive and efficient staff. The breakfast spread was amazing, and I have to reiterate that their guest services are exceptional. Thank you, Meruorah. I will definitely return with my family and friends!"
"186.","Michael van Trigt","11","2023-12-30","5","Perfect experience with a big personal touch. We first embarked a boat the night before. Which due to sickness had to be cancelled. We came last minute to the hotel with a request for a room. The room director; Debby, was very helpful and incredibly kind. They even send up more water for me to consume because I was still not feeling well. 10 out of 10 would recommend. The personal touch, the food, the comfortable room, and the view was well worth the money. Debby and the rest of the staff, thank you!"
"187.","Renut","77","2024-12-30","4","Situated at the start of town, it is just next to the fish market and 5 mins walk to the harbour. Hotel has a nice view and rooms are spacious and clean. A pity our nature view room which was on the 2nd floor was facing some strange wall and object. Please also note that the mosque is nearby and you will hear the early morning prayers. The hotel does provide ear plugs though. A good place to stay for a night if you want to be near town."
"188.","Raymond Valiant","740","2022-12-30","5","First of all, this hotel has a splendid view to the marina bay of Labuan Bajo. I suggest to book earlier a room with s view to the sea-side. If not that lucky, then you can still enjoy the view from the restaurant area at the first floor as well as the lounge and open air space at the top level. The hotel itself is quite well maintained, the service is acceptable and the overall experience is alright. The rooms are well furnished, clean and sanitized. The food and beverages are pretty default. The buffer dinner maybe a bit different in menu. However, I must warn you that not all picturesque and instagramable photos of this hotel may be in reality. There are still lacks in the sense of creating a five-star experience."
"189.","kylie robertson","2","2024-12-30","1","Unfort this was not what we expected with a 5 star hotel. Our stay started with our full view room being a tree not able to see anything else. A fridge that was required for medicine (insulin) did not work and had to be left in their kitchen. Stains on couch. A daily clean was not satisfactory with rubbish items not collected for disposal. Hot water in shower did not work until service came to fix. Management were of little assistance. Front desk were not willing to offer any local assistance as tourist who had not been to Flores before. Information desk/guides for guests would be ideal."
"190.","Joseph","319","2024-12-30","5","Wonderful location. Would stay here again. But not for a long vacation or time alone. It is smallish rooms and the view us narrow. Great staff working hard. Harbour view rooms are great....if you don't want to sleep in. Will stay here again and again."
"191.","Bill Holt","100","2024-12-30","4","I had originally booked a room at the Eco Tree 'Otel downtown, but found it so incredibly loud that I left without unpacking my bags, which was a first. I really needed a good night's sleep. The Meruorah was located on the edge of town and further away from busy roads, so I booked a room online. Arriving it became apparent that their systems are antiquated, as the front desk was unable to verify my online payment, which later became an issue. Asking for a quiet room, they recommended an upgrade to one facing the ocean, which also became an issue as I discovered that the early morning fishing boats made more noise than anything on the street. And regardless of room type, the super loud, piercing Muslim prayers from a nearby mosque could be heard everywhere. Thankfully I had silicone earplugs. That said, the room was clean, well-appointed, and the bed comfy, and I got the rest I needed prior to heading out on a liveaboard the next day. Shower was a warm trickle but did the job. All in all hotel doesn't feel very well cared for, is nowhere near its five star rating, and making money seemed more the focus. Taxi rides to the airport arranged by the hotel were inflated to 250k from a typical 75k, and laundry cost 40k per item when a nearby business (Anya) did all 15 of my items for the same price. The 250k breakfast buffet cost was way more than anything local. Would not likely repeat."
"192.","Andrew Granholm","30","2023-12-30","5","This is a beautiful hotel with STUNNING views of Flores. It's right on the water and the hotel lobby is one of the most beautiful I've seen. Half of the rooms face the ocean and the other half face the city, but my recommendation is to see if they can have you face the ocean. The location is at the center of town and it's walkable pretty much everywhere or a quick grab anywhere. The rooms were amazing, though the gym left something to be desired. That said it was still a lovely resort. Now, the only gripe I and a couple of guess had were some things were not as communicated as hoped. For instance, I request a taxi to the airport at 10:30 the day prior; however, the next day they lost my reservation and had to have the hotel driver drop me off. I think this happened to a few people and I'm not sure if it's that they were short staffed or things got lost in translation.. Despite that, the staff were really professional and friendly. I would 100% stay here again when I visit Flores."
"193.","Tada S","3","2024-12-30","2","Good location however don’t book the hill view room unless you want to be woken up each morning at 4:30am through loud speakers from a local place of worship. We booked 2 rooms travelling with young kids and only able to accommodate us on different levels."

PLEASE BOOK AT SEA VIEW for your better rest, especially if you book early morning trip. ROOMS ARE amazing. the staffs are also very nice.

"197.","Bastien","89","2024-12-30","3","This is difficult for me to put more than 3 stars for my stay in this hotel, I'll explain you why. Yes the view from the hotel is amazing and the rooms are nice and comfy, This hotel is certainly ticking the boxes to be a 5 stars hotel on the paper, but there are a lot of details that are a miss in my opinion hear me out: 1/ No welcome drinks even though it was included in my booking. 2/ They ask for a 2.5 millions Rp deposit for the room. Never been in a 5 star hotel which does this before. I told them I had no cash and only a debit card. They told me we would see later upon check-in (we arrived early) but turns out they didn't asked it when they gave us the key. (Good note on the guest service who allowed us to check-in 2h before as soon as our room was ready, thanks for that) 3/ Every time you want to get to/from your vehicule in the parking, you have to get out of the lift at ground floor, walk 100m, go downstairs, walk 100m in a dark, creepy parking (video attached). Definitely not a 5 star experience. They could allow guests to park outside in front of the reception, plenty of space, but you are not allowed to. 4/ Breakfast is very average for a 5 stars hotel. Food is mostly Indonesian and limited to basic options. 5/ There was some low volume music resonating in the room and heavy footsteps like someone dancing on Saturday night, enough to wake me up from midnight to 1 am. Guest support thinks it was a party on a boat in the bay in front but how do you explain the footsteps almost in sync with the loud music? So not really hotel faults it's either a guest on the floor above or a boat, but take in consideration that it can happen. 6/ The gym is super small and not enough equipment, no sauna / jacuzzi either. The pool and deck is quite small for such a huge hotel. Only 7 lounge chairs. They have a ton of conference rooms downstairs and on the rooftop of the secondary building that seems underutilized / not used at all. The layout of the hotel could have been better optimized in my opinion"
"198.","W Kris123","58","2023-12-30","4","Location, location, location. This is the main plus point for the hotel overlooking the ocean and the jetty. The room I picked was a superior seaview, which is the best as it has a balcony with a remarkable view of the ocean, small island and ships everyday. The only downside was sometimes the ships were a bit too noisy you could hear their activities as the room did not have a double glass door. Breakfast was ok, quite good on the variety and they also offered local delicacies. Service is good, staff are quite friendly and polite. Overall quite satisfied."

Staffnya ramah banget dan helpfull, cekatan pula. Aku suka banget sama lobby nya keren, nyaman indah dan cocok untuk tempat bengong ngelamunin masa depan. Kamarnya sesuai ekspektasi balkon mengarah langsung ke laut super keren sesuai permintaan di lantai 5. Untuk tempat tidurnya hmm sebenernya kurang sesuai ekspektasiku kalo ternyata ga senyaman dan ga sebesar dari hotelku sebelumnya tapi masih ok, kayanya ukurannya queen bed i dont know, bukan masalah. Ukuran kamarnya ga besar, ok ga jadi masalah juga, karena butuhnya untuk tidur bukan buat main futsal di dalam kamar. Menu sarapannya endulita banget cucok meong mantap jiwa enaaaakk dan bervariasi. Cuma yg aga bikin speechless air mineral di dalam kamar aku pikir bakal sama kaya waktu aku nonton yutubenya bobocan pake equil. Ternyata ini engga, air mineral biasa yg aku ga tau itu merk apa sebenernya. Atau mungkin equil hanya untuk kamar2 dengan harga yg lebih mahal dari kamarku kali ya, ga untuk semua jenis kamar. Lokasi super strategis, pas banget malamnya lagi ada pentas musik di deket hotel, cari makan gampang banget. Untuk lokasi dabest dah ini hotel dan fasilitasnya. Makasih ya meruorah 🥰♥️"

"202.","Grace","4","2024-12-30","2","My significant other and myself arrived at the hotel around 5:15pm to check in. There was a line maybe 12-15 people long at the check in counter that took us around 40 minutes to get through. We finally checked-in; however, we were told our room was not ready yet and to wait in the cafe/restaurant area for 20 minutes (it is already about 6pm at this point). After over an hour our room was finally ready (it was after 7pm by the time we got to our room and we had a business dinner at 7:30pm that we were consequently unable to make). We didn’t receive any type of free beverage or complimentary item during our wait as an apology. For any hotel this seemed really disappointing, but for a hotel boasting a five-star accommodation this seemed just bizarre and mis-advertised. We also booked a breakfast-included option (more expensive than without g and were told in the morning that our breakfast was not included and we had to pay 350,000 each for the buffet. Feel like we wasted some money staying here and were very disappointed with how our reservation was managed."

"207.","Rai SG","105","2023-12-30","5","A Pleasant Stay at Meruorah Hotel in Labuan Bajo, with One Small Hiccup During my recent trip to Labuan Bajo, I had the pleasure of staying at the Meruorah Hotel, which offered a memorable and enjoyable experience, albeit with one minor concern. The hotel's excellent service, beautiful location, and range of amenities made it a wonderful choice for my vacation, but the size of the room left a bit to be desired. The Meruorah Hotel's location is undoubtedly one of its most significant advantages. Situated in close proximity to the bustling harbor and offering stunning views of the surrounding seascape, the hotel provided a serene and picturesque setting. Watching the sunsets from the hotel's vantage point was a highlight of my stay. Upon arrival, I was greeted warmly by the friendly and accommodating staff, who ensured a smooth check-in process. Throughout my stay, their attentive service and willingness to assist with any requests were commendable. The hotel's common areas were tastefully decorated, exuding a charming and relaxing ambiance. The outdoor pool area was a delightful spot to unwind after a day of exploring the beautiful sights of Labuan Bajo. Additionally, the on-site restaurant offered a diverse menu featuring delicious local cuisine, satisfying my taste buds with every meal. Unfortunately, the one aspect that fell short of expectations was the size of the room. While it was clean and well-maintained, the limited space felt slightly cramped, especially when traveling with luggage. The room lacked ample storage, making it a bit challenging to keep things organized during my stay. Despite the room's size, the bed was comfortable, and the essential amenities were provided. However, I believe that a larger room or more efficient utilization of the available space would greatly enhance the overall guest experience. In conclusion, the Meruorah Hotel in Labuan Bajo offers an otherwise exceptional stay. Its prime location, attentive staff, and delightful facilities make it an ideal choice for travelers seeking comfort and relaxation. However, if the hotel could address the issue of room size, it would undoubtedly elevate the overall guest experience. Regardless, I would still recommend this hotel to fellow travelers, but advise them to consider their space requirements when booking their stay."

Also the room is spacious, clean, amanities are complete ( there are hairdryer and iron in the room). In the morning when the harbour is busy we can hear the horns and people 's activities. There is pools ( adult and kid), restaurant, spa and kids room in this hotel. Breakfast is kinda basic, there are not many options but everything that they serve are decent (i will give it 4/5 rating for the breakfast), also i think the restaurant needs to add some signature dish or local dish to the menu.

"213.","Teddy Hendra Z","143","2023-12-30","5","Nestled upon the edge of the cerulean Flores Sea, Meruorah Komodo Labuan Bajo promises an escape steeped in luxury and tranquility. The first glimpse of the infinity pool, mirroring the vast expanse of the horizon, instantly transports guests to a haven of peace. Local touches, woven into the décor of the spacious and elegant rooms, whisper the island's rich heritage, while modern amenities ensure every comfort is met. The staff, with their warm smiles and genuine hospitality, serve as attentive companions throughout the stay. Mornings are greeted by a symphony of flavors at the breakfast buffet, where traditional Indonesian delights dance alongside international fare, each bite a testament to culinary expertise. However, a slight lack of depth in the savory dishes serves as a gentle reminder that perfection, though striven for, is ever-elusive. While evenings may lack the boisterous energy of larger resorts, the quiet beauty of the island offers its own unique charm, inviting guests to fully immerse themselves in its serene embrace. Despite these minor imperfections, Meruorah Komodo Labuan Bajo delivers an experience that resonates beyond the moment. It is a tapestry woven with breathtaking views, impeccable service, and culinary artistry, creating an unforgettable escape into the heart of island paradise."

If we’d known this we could’ve just booked our own transfer. Also my husband was half laying down on one of the many lounges in reception and got told by a staff member that’s not allowed and to sit up!!! You definitely do not want to be told this while you’re on holidays. So many more hotels I’d wished we’d stayed at in Labuan bajo.

For example, the pool area has no access to shade and only 6 loungers, which seems inadequate for such a large hotel. The “restaurant” is more like a glorified cafe and the gym had no door, rendering the air conditioning useless. The rooms are functional and clean, but there is no place to hang a towel, nor any lotion or conditioner. The refrigerators are not well ventilated so things we put in actually came out warmer unless we left the cupboard door open, heating up the room. Breakfast was plentiful and tasty, with good, attentive service. Overall, an average stay in a place that set and failed to meet higher expectations."

"222.","Lex D","17","2024-12-30","1","This hotel is overclaimed that its 5 stars hotel, may be their local standard, not international standard. The room is horeible cause the sliding door cant close tightly. The hotel refused to change a new room. Since the room is facing the roadside, so the smoke from ciggerrates came to the room because the room is on second floor. Waiting for them to fix from 4pm-7:30pm, nothing. The hotel manager agreed to give a full refund by contract directly to Agoda since I booked via Agoda. After that Agoda told me that the hotel refused to give me a refund since its non-refund booking and no proof of letter confirmation from the hotel. This is ridicurous since its the hotel problem failed to provide a new room. They are trying to force the guests to stay in that horrible room. Finally, this hotel is not trustworthly. Unfornuately that this island has no any international hotel chains to compete the locals made the locals get rip off tourists by over price, not the quality."
"223.","Julie Henderson","123","2022-12-30","3","Unfortunately we were not over the moon with this hotel. Pulling up in the taxi, it seemed like an impressive resort but in actuality, it seems more corporate and business focused - lots of conference rooms and while the pool was nice enough, it wasn’t huge and there were only 6 sunbeds (two sets of 3), none of which had any shade available. Thus we ended up having to go to another hotel for our planned afternoon at the pool. Breakfast was good, a lot of variety of western and Indonesian foods. The rooms were fine and had a very nice view but our bathroom had a strong sulphur smell and the fridge did not stay very cold. If I were to visit Labuan Bajo again, I would most likely stay somewhere else."

The facilities are old and in need of repair or renovation. This was probably a very nice hotel at some point, but it is showing its age. It only has two very small elevators and only one of the two worked during our stay. Because of this, we had to use the stairs multiple times. Our room was huge, but only air conditioned in the bedroom and living room. Therefore, the large bathroom, shower, and walk in closet were extremely hot and humid. The staff were inattentive and forgot to deliver our luggage to the room. Even though the location is good, I would personally look for a better hotel if staying in LBJ."

So why am I giving a poor review? It's less about the room/hotel, but more about how they handled the issues related to the room. Firstly, me and my fiance are working this trip, so wi-fi is crucial especially for a luxury 5-star hotel (which the hotel should know, as we aren't the only guests who work during their holidays). We checked in on Monday night, where our room had no wi-fi. No biggie, we complained the next morning at 9AM. We leave after, and come back at 2PM, surprise-surprise still no wi-fi and no heads up from the front desk. Fiance comes to the lobby to complain, we leave again and come back at 9PM, maybe not so surprised anymore, still no wi-fi, still no heads up from front desk. We call to complain and the IT guy comes up and says its a problem from the provider and the provider themselves has to come down to fix the issue. Front-desk offered no solutions. We called after and they told us we need to switch rooms. It's 10PM now and we have to wake up at 5AM for a boat ride tomorrow All I need is some wi-fi so I can work. I ask if we can use the meeting rooms cause no one occupies the meeting rooms at 10PM. They said they need to check, check what? the occupancy? 15 minutes pass and again no word from the front desk. We have to call them again, and they finally agree to my terms. As a guest of a luxury 5-star hotel why do I have to be the one constantly looking for answers and solutions from the front desk. Be better. Just because you're government owned, doesn't mean you can treat your guests with a lower standard. Don't expect problems to just disappear and your guests to be silent. They need to do better. Would not recommend, save your money and stay somewhere else. Also I don't know where to put this, but the room had the stench of malt vinegar."

The view from the hotel is one of the best in the area, you could see sunset from there clearly. The hotel has a rooftop restaurant/bar and they occasionally have a bbq buffet. The experience was nice, the breakfast, the bbq buffet was also great, the service however was not exceptional, but not bad just normal for the 5-star hotel experience. 9/10 would go there again👍"
"228.","Lex Daru","7","2024-12-30","1","This hotel is a a scammer! According to the problem of room no: 2003 during period July 4-6, 2024. After check-in, around 4pm when I entered the room, I found out that the sliding door couldn’t be locked. So, I called the reception to send someone to fix it. So, they sent the mechanic to fix it. After finishing, I just found out that the sliding door cannot closed tightly. Since the room no: 2003 is on the second floor, which face to the roadside at that time I smelled smoke from the outside come in to my room via the gap of the sliding door, so I looked from the sliding door seeing someone smoking. If the sliding door is closed tightly like the other rooms, there shouldn’t have smoke coming from outside. Moreover, the insects, bugs, mosquitoes can easily get into the room via the gap of sliding door. So, I informed the receptionist at 5 pm to send someone to fix it, but it seemed that the receptionist didn’t pay much attention to it. So, I asked them to change to a new room instead, but they refused by giving an excuse that today the rooms all full. When I returned to my room around 7pm. The sliding door still had the gap. So, I came to inform the receptionist, they just said they would send the mechanic to fix it as soon as possible and asked me to inspect with them. So, I refused to enter the room to inspect with them because I already informed them since 5 pm to fix, and I’m a guest to come to stay for leisure, not coming for inspection since it’s the hotel’s problem that provides not good condition room to me. So, I asked the receptionist to see the manager, but they insisted that manager is already go home. Around 7:30pm, someone claimed that he is a supervisor came to inform me that the sliding door could not be fixed, but the smoke wouldn’t come into the room because nobody was there, he said that he couldn’t guaranteed that there will be mosquitoes in your room. Then the supervisor is gone. So, I came to check the room, the sliding door still has a gap, which cannot close tightly. They just keep me waiting from 5pm till 8 pm by closing the curtain and sprayed mosquito repellent all over the room, which makes no one can stay in the room. So, I decided to checkout. While, I’m carrying my luggage’s to the elevator, the supervisor came with another men, who is claimed that he is a manager. So, I took them to the room no: 2003. The manager inspected the sliding door can’t be closed tightly and smelled sprayed mosquito repellent. He just gave my an apology, so I asked him just changed the room, but he still insisted that all rooms are fully booked. So, I asks the manager that since he seen the room’s problem and can’t be changed to another room. I asked the manager at the night shift on July 4, 2024 that so, I just check out and the hotel just give me a full refund and I will find another hotel at 8 pm instead. The manager agreed on my offer. So, I called Agoda to tell the solution, at that time the Agoda agency had talked to the manager, but Agoda said that the manager refused to give the refund. After hung up the phone, I asked the manager why he told the Agoda that you would not give the refund, since the manager agreed to give a full refund to me. The manager answered that the hotel cannot give any refund to me since I have booked the room via Agoda, so I have to deal with Agoda and the full amount of refund will refund. I asked both manager and supervisor 3 times, they insisted that I would get full refund for sure. Around 8:30 pm, the hotel also offered a free ride from Meruorah Komodo Labuan Bajo Hotel to another hotel. However, on July 6, 2024, Agoda informed me that they cannot get a full refund to me because the hotel claimed that the booking cannot be refunded by claiming that the property are non-smoking and maintained a strict on this matter, which is not relevant since the problem is that the room isn’t in a good condition that leads smoke from outside and may have mosquitoes comes into the room. Moreover, the night shift manager is accept to refund by contacting Agoda to get full refund."

Prime location, however things will be much different if the trash in the water in the hotel vicinity could be removed. The docks is within walking distance if you wanted to explore the islands, and also lots of commercials including sports gear store, pharmacy, convenience store and coffee shops beside the hotel. Bars, bistros, and other seaside culinaries are also within walking distance. Wifi is very decent."

"234.","Michael L","10","2024-12-30","5","Meruorah was a perfect hotel After a long journey through the komodo national park on a boat for 5 days. It was perfect for a day of relaxation. Clean amenities. Easy check in. Good food with live music on a rooftop. Relaxing pool. Beautiful view of the harbor. Everything was great. Only thing I would improve upon is the ac unit. It works, but takes a very long time to cool the room. Otherwise Im very happy with everything"
"235.","Tubagus Rizky","28","2021-12-30","4","Amazing view of the bay, especially during sunset. Just make sure to choose the sea view rooms, cause the hill view is very unremarkable. Speaking of rooms, they feel more like 4-star hotel rooms. Breakfast buffet is also nothing amazing, just 4-star hotel standard or even lower. On the other hand, the infinity pool on the rooftop is a great choice to spend late afternoon till sunset."

"238.","The Bachinin Family","24","2023-12-30","2","This is parody for 5 star resort. If you can, better avoid this hotel. They had error with the system and we couldn’t get key in first day. So I went up and down 4 times with myself to find out they every time key is not working, before they send somebody with me to let me in to the room with master key, after that every time when we want to get to our room we have to go to reception and wait about 15 minutes in a queue to get to our room. When asked, can you fix the key and bring to our room, they simply say “no”. I have to go to reception to take it. Never ending Want welcome drink? Go to 6th floor to take it in the bar! Pool upstairs is a joke. There were a lot of more small disappointments as blinking light on the ceiling just in front of your eyes so you cannot sleep without closing it with tape, half-blocked sea view because of construction, dusty furniture etc. this hotel worth 5 times less then we paid for the room. We could stay in 3-stet hotel and our experience would much better."
"239.","Clarence Joseph Arokiasamy","15","2023-12-30","1","Very loud noise starting at 6.30 am due to staff celebrations. Paying 5 star hotel prices to be woken up at 6.30 am by loud music and shouting just in front of our room is just unacceptable. We were not told that the staff event would be happening when we checked in. A note was only provided to us in the morning when the party was already happening. Staff would not be bothered with our complains and brushed us off when we complained saying that nothing could be done. Horrible experience. Avoid at all cost. You will get more peace in a cheaper hotel."
"240.","Kelly Weymouth","19","2024-12-30","5","The view from the top floors is amazing! The location is perfect. Short walk to harbor and downtown restaurants and shops. The hotel is a little loud- you can hear what is happening above and next to you. Thin walls."
"241.","David","189","2024-12-30","1","The hotel is brand new, but it's falling apart already. They skimped out on the construction. There's rusty nails sticking out from the floorboards, the plaster on the walls is crumbling away, the paint on the walls is dirty and uneven. For service, it may be a 5 star hotel but they don't provide a 5 star service. For us, they offered an airport pickup service which we agreed to and booked. At the airport, they forgot about us so we were waiting around for half an hour while someone came to pick us up. When we got to the hotel, there were barely any guests, but we had to wait for 20 minutes in the lobby while they tried to prepare the hotel room key. We booked a private driver through the hotel a few weeks beforehand to drive around the island. The hotel didn't communicate the booking to the driver properly, so we found out from the hotel that we'd have to pay 50% extra on the day. This made a terrible stay even worse. It seems like this hotel is very poorly managed and very poorly maintained. It's a shame, the hotels in Bali were a fraction of the price but were brand new, were far better maintained and provided a better level of service. The difference is like night and day. I would look elsewhere instead of booking here."
"242.","a nexus","167","2024-12-30","3","This is not to the standard of 5* hotels i have grown to expect in Indonesia. Service was inconsistent, the rooms were awkwardly designed (strange nooks and crannies, bedside table on one side only,) and food was average. The price was expensive when compared to the rest of Indonesia for what you receive. Lastly, I choose to pay the hotel for a shuttle from the airport to the hotel on arrival - there is no Uber or equivalent and was willing to pay up a little for the convenience. I expected a hotel vehicle, what I received was a regular taxi, the hotel charged me 225k IRP and paid the taxi driver 50k - they made 450% profit - that's an outrageous profit margin. On the return trip I arranged my own taxi and paid 50K. Arranging your own taxi on arrival should be easy - there are lots, but you will need cash."

"245.","AnilKumar Bijjahalli","72","2023-12-30","5","Meruorah Komodo Labuan Bajo Hotel is a stunning hotel located on the seafront, just 10 minutes from the new airport and close to the marina. This beautiful location offers breathtaking views and is set to host the 2023 ASEN summit. During my stay at the hotel, I was impressed with the excellent service and attention to detail. Despite the preparations for the upcoming summit, there was no disruption to guests during their stay. The hotel staff was working hard to ensure that everything was in order for the event while also making sure that guests were comfortable and well taken care of. One of the highlights of my stay was dining at the hotel's restaurant. The food was delicious, and the service was exceptional. The staff went out of their way to accommodate my strict vegetarian diet, and Mr. Julius, in particular, was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the food on offer. Another highlight of my stay was the exceptional service provided by the hotel staff. From check-in to check-out, the people were friendly and always willing to help. Mr. Ferbi was another staff member who stood out during my stay. He was friendly, knowledgeable, and went above and beyond to make sure that guests had a great experience. Overall, Meruorah Komodo Labuan Bajo Hotel is a great place to stay in a convenient location. The hotel is well maintained, and the staff are friendly and knowledgeable. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Labuan Bajo and looking for a comfortable and enjoyable stay."

"249.","Angela Yu","14","2023-12-30","2","I would not recommend staying here at all. Beautiful views and room (very comfortable bed), but there is basically no service or when it's there, it's unhelpful and inadequate. There was a large police event while I stayed there that blocked off the entrance to the hotel and the road, during check-in times. Because of this, I had to drag my big bags over. No one came to help me even when I was right in front of the hotel and they could obviously see me struggling with my bags. The event basically took over the hotel and their staff. Another time, I went to sit down in the lobby on the couch and someone from the event told me I couldn't sit there. I told hotel staff and they seemed confused, and ushered me to a different section without sorting it out properly with the event person. I asked the concierge about an activity, and they said they would let me know. I never heard from them again. I was very disappointed in this hotel. I would have had the same experience if they left a lockbox with a key for my room for check-in and check-out. I couldn't wait to leave."

You don’t need ride into town because you are next door to all the nice resto, the seaport for your tour, and the famous night market. It can get a bit noisy when the ships are blowing their horns but that happens during the day. Staff is super friendly and room is comfy and clean. Ask for a room facing the water if you want to see a beautiful sunset from your balcony. Lastly, the breakfast buffet is a must! So many good selections and includes a full bakery. Don’t miss it or you’ll regret it."

Despite confirming our cab booking twice, they were utterly incompetent, causing chaos with our transportation. Don't be fooled by their empty promises; they can't be trusted. Now, let's talk about the food at the hotel restaurant, which is a complete disaster. Brace yourself for tasteless torment. The dishes they serve are a horrible mix of flavors that will make you question why you're even eating. Prepare for regret with every overpriced bite. The audacity of this place knows no bounds! They charge exorbitant prices for subpar service. Save yourself the pain and go somewhere else where you'll get more for your money. When you enter your room, be prepared for a nasty surprise. Insects will be your unwelcome roommates. I urge you, don't make the same mistake I did. Stay far away from this hotel. The staff is incompetent, the food is terrible, the prices are outrageous.

This Stunning hotel has a beautiful infinity pool on 6th floor roof overlooking the harbor and surrounding city along with a restaurant and a nightclub on the seventh floor. Suite was spotless with every detail and all the amenities were covered(bathrobes, fully stocked mini fridge with non alcoholic beverages, plush towels, toothbrushes, soaps and coffee machine) staff was very friendly and helpful with any requests we had giving us a warm smile. Breakfast starts at 6am and ends at 10am (included with stay) so you have about 15-20 before your Komodo island tour bus picks you up(this hotel is the last stop before the dock) so 6am pick up will be around 6:20am at this hotel. Breakfast is out of this world! Everything you can imagine plus it’s fresh with fantastic service. This is a 5 stars resort in an up and coming city that I’m sure will be a modern, clean upscale Version of Bali in 10 years. Airport is 7 minutes away and a $3 taxi ride, roads are new or being upgraded and modern upscale businesses are coming in, so much potential to come for this beautiful community. Highly recommend this hotel to everyone! Update: after first night the curtains in bedroom don’t close all the way so morning sun may effect your sleep but I will pass it on to management, one other detail was the suite had 2 TV’s(one tv had CNN but the other did not?) big bonus for full coffee bar at breakfast! Cappuccino, latte, shots."

Untuk kamar hotelnya juga bagus. Kabarnya kalo Pak Jokowi ke Labuan Bajo, selalu nginep di sini."

"277.","Reza Chen","6","2022-12-30","5","The first thing that crossed my mind when I entered the hotel lobby was: I was going to enjoy my stay here. The hotel was located in a very strategic area, close to practically every place you’d want to visit to make your stay more enjoyable: Cafés, restaurants, ATMs, supermarkets, you name it. The sidewalk was pretty wide, making it great for strolling around the area. When I entered the hotel lobby, I was welcomed by the view of the sea with beautiful islands as its background. It was made even better since the design of the hotel lobby made it possible for the guests to enjoy the view comfortably due to its incorporating open space concept. Breathtaking. I stayed in a room with a balcony that faced the sea. I believed I sat at the balcony most of the time since the view was just too good to miss. The room was comfortable, no major complaint from me. However, I could hear the voice of the guests next to my room since the rooms were connected by a connecting door. It was not a big issue, but probably could be improved since the guests next door was not even talking with a very loud voice. As for the food, I only ate the breakfast. It was a buffet with a quite wide range of options. Some of the food was a bit too salty to my liking (e.g., the beef bacon and the cold cuts), but the rest was tasty. One thing to note, the hotel was located next to the sea. Since one of the main attractions of Labuan Bajo was living aboard, there were quite a lot of boats that docked near the hotel. It was not a problem in the daylight, but might be a bit annoying for some people in the night as it could be a bit noisy. Overall, it was a pleasant stay and I would love to visit Meruorah again someday!"

Was under construction when we arrived and we could hear everything, also early in the morning. A/C stopped working mid night. Generally speaking it is NOT a 5 stat hotel. Maybe 3. Not worth the price, not worth your hours of sleep. Hillside view = musk view. Be aware of that as you will wake up at 4:38 every day. Only good thing is that its on the main street (which you can hear from your bed)."

IMO hotel needs to improve take away breakfast..asked them a much more healthy option. And they make it. Even hostels have better option. Also, because I booked 4 sea view rooms they provided bathrope. But they only provide for suite. Which make non sense... Also, they have those private parties in the evening so you can't enjoy the restaurant balcony/terrace. And they ask you to eat at G floor. Overall, I will come back because the staff is great and clean hotel"

"286.","Meee","3","2022-12-30","3","We stayed for 4 nights Overall It's 4.5 star hotel . Not 5 star. What I cannot stand is the smell of pillows. All of 4 pillows smelled musty. I couldn't use them at all . My husband wrapped them with bath towel. In addition, a comb got mold .Even though I threw away to a trash bin everyday, The house keeping took it back and placed the same one again, or the new one which got mold was set . Amenity is minimum. I hope there are some body cream ,better quality shampoo , cotton buds or something. About morning buffet quality, compared to another 5star hotels, I cannot say it's satisfying. Taste is normal. There were so many flies around foods. It's better to cover all of foods. Shower Toilet doesn't work well. What I give 5 star to is cleanliness and location!! It's excellent!!. I'm satisfied with that ."

The view from the Lobby and the Restaurant is the best. I would never regret to give 5 stars rating for this Hotel. But, I should say the food is not too special due to less variant and taste is not excellent. Once I ordered pasta with prawn, it was so salty. Really salty!! However, I believe this Hotel will be growing fast and being one of the great hotel in Labuan Bajo due to its location is close to the airport."

I just arrived and queuing already and then was being asked to pass the ID card so that they could paralelly process the check in admin (that's what they said earlier) and I waited just near the lobby at the seating area. And then I saw couples of new guests are being served for check in process. This has been more than 20 minutes waiting time, until I myself asked the receptionist. And they said just because I wasn't there, they skip my registration. They were they one who asked me to wait nearby the lobby, I have waited for almost 20 minutes seeing other new guests were being served and they put the blame on me WITHOUT even saying sorry. What a horrible experience."

"306.","CC Y","160","2022-12-30","2","Very impressed by the foyer which really captures the local landmark and harbour. Check in fine and off to my room 2003 (door needs some wd40) hillside view and it was suggested I should try harbour next stay. Room well set out and has a balcony with no view to speak of which is one of the first disappointments. Go to swim and try bar and told cannot as the Presidents wife staying there and hotel serverly restricted, this explained the 100s of police around. Can not use gym or pool or eat in 6th level bar. I raised this with reception and asked why wasn't I advised prior or at check as paying for full amenities. Could not explain and offered 1 x meal of room service to compensate. Ridiculous. At 420am after a night on a great bed the local mosque starts and not even industial ear plugs would drown it out. This continues 3 times daily light sleeps or even heavy will be challenged. As others have mentioned the hotel isn't so much 5 star as there is shoddy workmanship about:loose boards, fittings not fitting etc buffet breakfast leans towards a local and Malay crowd but tasty, would suggest signs to let folk know what is vegetarian or not. Most staff are truely lovely but again 5 star their English skills could be lifted, but much better than my Indonesian. Views at sunset are to die for and once we could access pool it was heaven though no shade. In the main street with not all that much around but some decent eats within walking distance. I wouldn't go back and almost moved to another more remote resort when restricted to room only."

Later that night the front office said they cannot find the key to open the connecting door. We asked for maintainance personil to force open the connecting door, and they said they had no maintainance personil. Wow.... 5 stars hotel without any maintainance personil. The next day, we had booked take away breakfast for island hopping by speed boat, when we wanted to pick up the take away breakfast no body at front office nor kitchen aware about our reservation. We must higher our voice before getting the kitchen prepared the take away breakfast. Meruorah really succeed to ruin our holiday mood. Their service was nightmare. Only front office staff saying sorry without ability to give any solution. No manager concerned about our complaints. Definitely won't recommend this hotel."

Ricky made my wife comfortable, escorted me to the pharmacy where he translated for me so that I could purchase medical supplies, and even provided ice for my wife's knees and tea free-of-charge.

"341.","YAN DJUNA","36","2020-12-30","5","Pengalaman tidur mewah di resort bintang lima yang dengan panorama luar biasa. Dari kolam renang (infinity pool) nya yang besar, langsung bisa melihat perahu, phinisi, laut dan dermaga tempat siapapun yang berwisata ke pulau-pulau kecil seperti Rinca, Komodo, Padar. Beruntung bisa berenang sambil melihat sunset. Melihat sunset juga bisa dari restorannya yang berada di lantai 5 atau dari kamar tidur bila memilih kamar jenis sea view. Dari Komodo airport hanya 7 menit saja. Dan begitu tiba langsung ketemu lobby yang langsung melihat laut. Letak Inaya Bay Komodo di Labuan Bajo sungguh strategis sebab dekat dengan pusat jajanan seafood yang segar di sebelahnya yang bernama Kampung Ujung dan plaza yang terdapat Starbucks, restoran-restoran, BRI, Telkomsel. Staf yang ramah akan melayani dengan senang hati. Untuk fasilitas segera akan ada fitnes center, spa dan ballroom untuk 700 pax."

"351.","Bull Dogg","962","2022-12-30","1","We had a firm reservation with this hotel, done on the hotel website, and it was cancelled the day after due to “an overbooking issue”. There was a government conference in Labuan Bajo the same week we visited and we were bumped at the benefit of some other guest. However, the hotel kept our money AFTER they cancelled our reservation and then assumed, without informing us, that we would want a room if another guest cancelled. We were dumbfounded to learn, through a Whatsapp message, that this had happened, when the hotel asked us, at 19:20 the evening of the original reservation date (three days after canceling our reservation!), when we would check in! Obviously we already found another hotel immediately after receiving the cancellation from Meruorah. We find this unprofessional and unethical. We will come back to Labuan Bajo, and then we will choose another hotel. Fortunately, JW Marriott is building a new luxury resort about 3 minutes from Meruorah, and we look forward to staying there, or in another resort in the area - most of which have better locations than the Meruorah."

Currently(early Jan 2020) the management still working their rooms expansion building also clearing the old pier sea fronts. I am happy with their chatty ground staffs, they would uniformly greets with our pleasure(dengan senang hati) to their guests. One thing that I find troublesome, are. They dont & cant provide a nail clippers on their services. Assuming a 5 star hotel would close or provide more than your own places. I hope in the future they will provide more of small things matter to their customers. It would be a lose appreciation if they still ignoring this kind tiny accidents like this. Tonight its its my last stay here, I would hate it to leave such wonderful Flores island remembering top high star hotel on a island still cant provide a nail cutter to their guest. I have asked 2 departments(house keeping & front desk) before dark, and they answers with same- sorry we dont have it rhymes.

But food need more variety - Strategically located near to marina (walking distance) and in the same building with small mall : KFC, Starbucks, Kimia Farma, PCR Clinic. - Walking distance to some good eateries : Kampung Ujung, Taman Laut, La Cucina, Hong etc. - Excellent sunset view Cons : - No good view for Signature Hill View Room. Need to improve sound proof especially with mosque just across the street. - Small pool, not suitable for kids - Take away breakfast only ready after 05.15 (for people who want to take early morning sailing tour)"

Padahal ketika akan melakukan reservasi sudah disebutkan bahwa refund adalah fasilitas yang kita terima. Terakhir bertanya kapan estimasi refund tersebut, jawabannya “terus terang ini yang susah bagi kami”. Apa iya hotel bintang 5 yang sampai diresmikan presiden, tidak punya standar proses refund? Kita sebagai customer pasti sudah sangat sabar & tentu akhirnya menghadapi proses hampir 2 bulan ini sangat merasa tidak secure. Apalagi dengan nominal yang tidak sedikit dan alasan refund pun sangat2 wajar sekali. Merasa sangat kecewa"

I should say that most of the staff were excellent, especially Dominik. Thank you for your top notch hospitality! He was definitely an asset for Inaya! Oh, also Diana. Thank you for the extra miles especially when you helped us to find a birthday candle for one of our friends in the group. However, my colleague and I had a glitch on the second night with the front desk due to their check in policy. There was quite inconvenient and I didn't expect to have such an experience with a 5-star hotel. I'd like them to take that glitch as an evaluation to have a better service & hospitality ahead. Since I reside in Labuan Bajo, I surely will cooperate with and stay in Inaya Bay again. Therefore, I hope I can give a 5-star review in the future."

Iam sure Labuan Bajo developing some this and that as their way to put the badge of Premium Tourism Area'. And one of them Inaya Bay Komodo. For city people if u need to hang out and keep to get your city atmosphere ...perhaps u can get it here. Starbucks , KFC, Planet Station and also pharmacy too. Stand on the center of Labuan Bajo (*Kampung Ujung), this place quiet strategic as well. May you explore behind the buolding and u can see the harbor too. I have to give compliment for people who work here to keep this place keep clean. I live the trees on the side road too... just a good combination between nature and modern architecture."
