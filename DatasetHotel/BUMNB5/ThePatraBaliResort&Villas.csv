The truly Bali-like park not only invites you cordially, but the more so make you experience dedicated hospitality and care. Always quick and accurate service. Great and fresh local food is yummy. The pool and its bar are well equipped and operated. Thank you barlady Puspa for your adequate action when I hurt myself. Your Margheritas are truly healing! Thank you pool hero Budiarta for your service and kind attention in the hospital. You are a great support in moments of uncertainty. Thank you Natalia and Heba for your daily kind and professional service in the restaurants. Great pizzas you serve! And the herbal drinks have been a discovery to this enthoustastic Dutchman!"
"2.","Danielle Dufall","76","2025-11-30","1","We chose to stay at The Patra Resort & Villas because of its beautiful grounds. I’ve stayed here many times before and, having just had a baby, I thought it would be the perfect place to relax. Unfortunately, that memory has been completely shattered. The resort has clearly gone downhill badly. What was once a 5-star experience now feels neglected and rundown. It’s insulting to be charged full price for what’s advertised as a luxury resort when it barely meets a 3-star standard. The towels were in worse shape than those at low-end motels — thin, frayed, and clearly years past their use-by date. It feels like nothing has been updated in over 15 years. At the pool bar, we were told we couldn’t charge a drink to our room. I had already checked in, provided three passports, and left my credit card on file, yet somehow this basic convenience wasn’t available. Never in my life have I experienced such a ridiculous policy at a so-called 5-star resort. Instead of relaxing, I had to walk back to the room, soaking wet, to get my card all because no one at check-in bothered to mention this policy. Completely unacceptable and embarrassing. Then came the final straw. On our second night, around 9:30pm, the room phone rang loudly — waking both my husband and our 7-month-old baby. It was the hotel about a transaction issue. We said we’d check it, but they called two more times, waking our baby each time. The noise was blaring, and the complete lack of consideration was infuriating. When my husband explained they had woken our child they laughed like it was a joke. I emailed the hotel regarding this and they didn’t even have the decency to reply. I gave them the opportunity to respond and nothing. I’m honestly devastated by how our stay has turned out. The first two nights have been stressful and exhausting instead of peaceful. I wish we could cancel the rest of our stay. To make matters worse, we have friends joining us soon, and I’m embarrassed to have recommended this resort. Nobody should have to spend their holiday angry and counting down the days until they can leave. I do not recommend the Patra villas and resort and unfortunately we won’t be back. I’ve given many reviews on google and they have always been honest, if I could have given 0 stars I would have."

However, since my arrival, I have experienced nothing that has anything to do with a 5-star hotel. Even at check-in, the staff were completely confused. Although they asked me if I wanted the upper or lower suite, they wanted to give me the upper one. At least the coffee tastes good in the restaurant of a 5-star hotel. Although I paid by credit card and they have my details, I can't charge anything to my card/final bill. You order a salad with tuna and what you get is not tuna. They've chopped it up so finely that you can't even tell if it was tuna in the first place. To me, it tasted like chicken. Another long discussion ensued. In the end, they called me in my room in the evening to say that I hadn't paid the bill immediately. I explained to them that I had given them my room number and would pay when I checked out. A huge scene for 200,000 IDR in the end. They want a deposit of this amount. You don't need to worry about this amount if you do a good job and offer good quality. Customers will pay on their own if the quality and service are right. On top of that, there are lots of construction sites and building work going on everywhere and the Japanese restaurant is closed. But there's no mention of this on the website. The hotel is run-down and you shouldn't expect 5-star hotel quality. The staff are not properly trained. I'll be glad when I can finally check out here."

Enak banget buat joging pagi atau sore dipinggir pantai, sunset ok punya. Kolam renang bersih. Bangunan kamarnya terlihat agak tua, tapi bersih dan rapi. Makanannya enak dan beragam 💙 Staf sangat ramah."
"5.","Tomas Colard","6","2025-09-30","3","Decent hotel. The rooms are nice, but getting a little bit old. The pool is nice. Also convenient that it is close to the airport. Lastly, the staff is also friendly. Wouldn't recommend to eat at the hotel as prices are triple of what you pay in town, a bit ridiculous. The taxi to the airport is 150k IDR for 2 minute drive. Take a grab and it is 25k. A bit odd."
"6.","Martana Yasa","3","2025-10-30","5","Best Five Star Hotel near of the airport, great place during waiting the flight. Clean and comfort room, best quality of food and beverage, great pool for relaxing. It's not only hotel, but a lot story behind of this property. Thank you for sharing great experience of Balinese History & Culture. Most recommended and must try!"
"7.","Danit Henarusti","29","2025-11-30","5","Sangat berkesan menginap selama 2 malam disini.. staff hotel ramah, menu breakfast enak dan beragam, layanan buggy car yang siap antar jemput dari lobby ke kamar, lokasi pinggir pantai dan dekat bandara sungguh menjadi pengalaman yang indah. Kolam renang luas, sangat cocok jika membawa keluarga menginap disini. Semoga next time ke bali lagi bisa stay di the patra. Sukses selalu"
"8.","Yggdrasiii GBX","3","2025-12-23","1","Really bad room condition. Smell tap water, smell air, everything moist, and lots of cockroach and mosquito. Not acceptable for living in this room with children and parents. When I tried to cancel the accommodation, they did everything they could to avoid it, constantly making excuses and deliberately making things difficult for me. They even tried to stop me from answering the phone when I called for help. I spent five hours arguing with them, which caused me to lose many other plans and forced me to look for another hotel in the middle of the night. Despite all this, I still insisted on cancelling. This place is simply bullying its customers."
"9.","Amel Seddiki","12","2025-11-30","2","Unfortunately, our stay at this hotel was quite disappointing. The room we received was very old and nothing like the photos shown online. There were also mosquitoes inside the room, which made our stay very uncomfortable. We were also surprised that even basic drinking water was not provided, and we were told we had to pay for it — something that should be a standard service for guests. Overall, the experience was not comfortable and definitely not worth the price. I hope the management improves the cleanliness, updates the rooms, and provides better basic amenities."
"10.","Jacqui Oakley","54","2025-09-30","5","I was really surprised by this resort the pool and meals where beautiful. Staff fantastic. Slightly older style but rooms more like an apartment still clean and lovely. Only complaint is the spa is not well sign posted and is lacking the resort style this beautiful place should have."
"11.","David Rudge","202","2025-11-30","5","It was a great place to stay for one night we just over nighted as we had a plane to catch the next day. Great room but it is a massive complex but they will take you and pick you up in a golf cart. My only negative was I thought the food and drink was overpriced for what it was Breakfast buffet was ok had better but ok since it is included in the price of the room"
"12.","Nidhi Dave","45","2025-09-30","5","Beautiful and relaxing location. Villas were nice. Room service options are limited and longer wait times for food to be delivered but otherwise it’s a good place to relax, unwind and just have a good family time. Beach at hotel is not very clean, pool etc is good to hang out."
"13.","Meredith McGregor","103","2025-10-30","4","I booked The Patra very last minute, at about 11pm, to escape an awful, noisy hotel. I wish I'd booked this place originally. It's so close to the airport (though not disturbed by aviation noise) and has a lovely resort vibe with nice tropical gardens. Rooms aren't exactly new but are very comfortable and the bed and pillows were excellent. Most importantly, it was quiet and I was able to sleep, which wouldn't have happened had I stayed at the other hotel. Breakfast was excellent- plenty of Indonesian, western, Chinese and Indian vegetarian options. Love the Indonesian desserts! Gluten free bread is apparently available if you give them notice. I didn't find the staff particularly warm, but they were efficient. I didn't have time to use any of the facilities, but I used the on-site money changer, which had good rates. The resort definitely is ageing, but is well-maintained and provides a high-quality Bali resort experience minutes from the airport, so is perfect for a transit. I will stay here again next transit. Edit: I stayed here again at the end of my trip, due to its proximity to the airport. As good as the first time. Tried the spa, nice massage - not sure if the current location is a temporary one? Stayed again in a deluxe suite. Unlike the first stay, there was no TV in the bedroom- looked like it had been removed and not replaced. Was still able to use the one in the living area. Would stay again."
"14.","Bayu Bhaskara","266","2025-10-30","5","Wow, awesome The ballroom is perfect, food is good and excellent service bring from their staff. From lobby you can find exciting stunning painting view you cant imagine, how they are painting there😬. Pool also good, there having event for friday night for classic dance. Thanks so much for bring us best moment here."
"15.","haydee cowper","14","2025-08-30","2","The setting and the gardens are beautiful, the accommodation was tired and a bit shabby. Some of the staff were very helpful but it took 15 minutes to bring us a drink and it wasn’t busy, some of the staff were indifferent and worse rude. The food in the buffet breakfast was awful, tasteless, not fresh except for the egg station which was cooked fresh. The pools were great however there were only a few lounges around them so hardly any of the patrons could be accommodated. This hotel had been recommended to us and we were disappointed and won’t go back."
"16.","PAUL 10","8","2025-12-09","3","Rooms were the least impressive part, a bit dated, but still clean. The actual villa itself was beautiful. Breakfast was nice. The service was really good. Was only there for one night and was a nice stay."
"17.","Bagjoz Mezzo","193","2025-08-30","1","Hotel bintang 5 yg menurut kami “kurang layak” Tiba di lokasi jam 2 pas, tidak ada penyambutan petugas didepan utk menurunkan koper . proses cek in lama, saya sudah pesan di OTA Traveloka tp di resepsionis tidak ada data alhasil kita harus nunggu dulu cukup lama, 1 jam menunggu tidak kunjung dipanggil kalo kita ga nanyain mungkin gak akan di panggil2 . Setelah drama menunggu 1jam 10 menit kita dapat kamar dan kecewa lagi ketika ke kamar tidak ada buggi yg mengantar,kita jalan ke kamar yg lumayan jauh dari lobi,kalo saya pribadi gak masalah tp kita berlima+1 bayi umur 1,5thn . Setelah sampai kamar kunci nya pun tidak bisa utk membuka kamar. Untung ada petugas yg membukakan. Kamar mandi shower gabisa nyala,wc ga bisa si splash. Shampo cuma dapet satu pdhl kita berlima. kalah bgt sama hotel2 bintang 2,3,4. Entah karena ramai atau perlakuan berbeda karena kami turis lokal bukan bule. Sangat berbeda jauh dengan hotel2 bintang 5 di nusa dua yg mereka tdk membeda2 kan turis lokal maupun mancanegara pdhl saya dapet Harga tidak jauh berbeda. Cukup sekali kesini kapok 😂"
"18.","Rahul Goyal","9","2025-08-30","3","Depending upon how one has preference. My recommendation is this property is below par. 1. Right on public beach. You can stroll around. The public beach is not very clean. 2. Room provided to us was approx 1 KM from lobby. Took us 15 minutes to walk. Most of time we waited for buggy for a ride. Be prepared to walk under hot sun. 3. Two restaurants on property and the Italian restaurant we found always empty. The other restaurant food menu had limited choice. One day we had moring tour @6.45 AM. Even the staff did not arrive till 6.45 AM for breakfast, though was supposed to be open @ 6.30 AM. 4. My wife fell down and had bruised knee. The hotel did not have even a band-aid. I asked for ice-pack, was diverted to bar. Ended up taking some ice cubes in a plastic cup. 5. There are no restaurants nearby. You need a vehicle to go out. Alternatively you can order food through an app. However, be prepared to pick up from lobby. Not convenient if you are 1 km away. 6. This is a Government run property as informed by my driver. In nutshell, the best I would qualify the property as 3 star."
"19.","Amy Price","11","2025-09-30","5","We had a fantastic stay at The Patra. The rooms were very spacious and clean. The pool was very large with ocean views. All the food was delicious but most importantly the staff were so friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend The Patra for any transits as it is so close to the airport."
"20.","Andrey Belov","62","2025-07-30","1","Oh my... This is not a 5 star hotel, however it matches its very low price. Rooms are very dated and moldy, everything smells and is falling apart. Towels are yellow. Showers barely work. Sheets are well used. Bar and restaurant are really old...and food is uninspiring. Beach is a trash field. + You constantly hear the airport."
"21.","Daniel Jackson","36","2025-09-30","2","I don’t think I would stay here again. The place is old and the room had a funny smell. It was a unique 2 story room but we didn’t appreciate having to take stairs up to the bedroom and the furniture downstairs was very uncomfortable. Also the beach by the hotel is super crowded and dirty. Trash everywhere. The one plus is it’s close to the airport."
"22.","mohamed ilyaz","25","2025-11-30","2","I stayed 3 nights, Hotel is quite old not sure if we can call as 5* hotel, where they are charging for water bottle from guests when you run out of water in your room, laundry staffs are ringing doorbells no stop in the morning which is really annoying, airport transport is 150k for not even 1min drive. Breakfast buffet is very less options serving, Restaurants prices are nightmare I don’t recommend to dine in at hotel restaurants, Services are average on the day one buggy driver was not even smiling as I had 3 luggage’s he’s not ok to drop on my room."
"23.","Ria","357","2025-08-30","5","I love the Patra Bali. I stayed there a few times. The location is superb. It is close to the airport but i don't feel disturbed by the noise. I really enjoyed the sunset view. You can see planes landing and take off with sunset behind them. The beach in front of the resort is beautiful. You can swim there. There is a big and beautiful statue here too. The rooms and building are quite old but well maintained. The room size is big. Some of them will require you to climb stairs. So if you have problems with stairs maybe can ask for room on the ground floor. I love old hotels like this than modern ones. It presents Balinese culture. I love their swimming pool also. It is quite big hotel complex. Service is good. I recommend this hotel."
"24.","Mustafa Moutaz","162","2025-11-30","3","Food is accepted Room service is good Location is good Atmosphere is good Going to your room is annoying specially if you want a car you must wait several minutes if there was a car!! Going to lobby you must walk 5 min or waiting a car!! They need to add some new towels! And clean the entire room specially the bathroom!"
"25.","Lauren Pierik","1","2025-10-30","1","I had a very bad experience with this resort. I made the payment through a bank transfer as instructed, but only the next day—after the money had already been sent—they informed me that Indonesian banks are unreliable and that it could take a long time for the funds to arrive. Because of this, I was forced to pay a second time with my credit card in order to secure my booking. Months later, the money from the bank transfer was officially debited from my account, but the resort continues to claim that they never received it. When I contacted them, they refused to issue a refund. In fact, during a phone call, they literally told me that my money was “gone” and that I would never get it back. This is extremely upsetting. If they had informed me before the transaction—not after—I would have never made the bank transfer in the first place. I feel misled and treated unfairly, and I would strongly caution others against making payments to this resort via bank transfer."
"26.","Aini","287","2025-08-30","5","Ada bintang sepuluh enggaaaa.. wow banget. Yang kasi ratting 1 ini patut dipertanyakan. Beneran inep di sini apa buzzer. Hehehe.. saya datang bersama keluarga sudah pukul 2 dini hari. Petugas dan kru tetap menyambut kami dengan ramah dan baik. Diantar dengan Pak Diamus yang sudah bekerja 24 tahun di hotel ini. Sehat selalu bapak.. Hotel aset plat merah ini, di bawah naungan Pertamina. Jadi tau sedikit historinya. Pagi hari kami sarapan dan anak usia di bawah 6 tahun tidak dikenakan biaya tambahan. Setelah sarapan kami jalan-jalan ke pantai dan hotel memiliki akses sendiri ke pantai. Teman-teman bisa melihat landasan runway pesawat karena hotel ini emang tepat berada di sisi airport Ngurah Rai. Di sini juga ada pantai Jerman dan pantai Kuta. Saya lebih suka ke pantai Jerman karena engga terlalu ramai. Pantainya juga bersih. Pasirnya berwarna hitam keabu-abuan dan sangat lembut. Untuk makan pagi, ragamnya sangat bervariasi dengan rasa yang sangat lezat. Mantab deh pokoknya. Hehehe.. semoga lain kali bisa ke sini lagi dan bisa lama2 😅 Saat cek out kami dilayani Mbok Dwi yang sangat ramah. Terimakasih ya semua staf Hotel Patra. Ini tambahan (Agt '25) buat review saya setelah baca review beberapa tamu belakangan yg kurang baik. Semoga management hotel Patra bisa menanggapinya dg baik. Alhamdulillah banget saya disambut staf dengan baik meski datang dini hari. Even saya wisatawan lokal, kami disambut dengan ramah sekali."
"27.","Biju Bhaskar","25","2025-06-30","4","A peaceful resort near the airport with a spacious layout and traditional Balinese charm. I was pleasantly surprised with a free upgrade to a suite—thanks to the hotel team! The villa was spacious and surrounded by beautiful gardens. Buggies are available to transfer between the lobby, pool, and beach, which is super convenient. Loved the beachfront access, and breakfast even had some Indian options. A great place to relax and wind down before a flight."
"28.","iksan surya tirta","12","2025-10-30","5","Best deal banget.. kolam renang luas, ada kolam terpisah utk anak yang cukup besar. Belakang hotel langsung view pantai 👍🏻 Jarak dari lobby ke kamar jauh, tapi ada buggy car yang siap antar jemput"
"29.","Steven Lee","11","2025-12-16","3","Definitely not a 5star No need to choose this one bec of their location to the airport Room is soo old and far away from lobby/entrance"
"30.","Riddhi Sangoi","8","2025-12-09","1","Property and the Rooms are decent. Their room service is fine but their Airconditioner doesn't work after 12 in the morning. And their restaurant and food options are pathetic, the restaurant stinks badly and food here doesn't taste good."
"31.","Shades of the City Ky","71","2025-11-30","5","Large resort that runs traditional style Can’t complain for the price we are paying, very good for value (5 star hotel that’s new and polish are at least x3 x4 times this price) Rooms are very large Yes it’s old, however, no smell/rotten part Wouldn’t recommend the restaurant - it’s overpriced with small western menu"
"32.","Taufiqur Rohman","332","2025-07-30","5","Resort yang luas dengan konsep kamar berbentuk villa, memiliki beberapa kolam renang yang memiliki akses ke pantai, menu sarapan bervariasi. Selain itu, patra dekat sekali dengan bandara (bisa jalan kaki),"
"33.","Nurotus Saniyah","8","2025-08-30","5","Recommended sekali. Resortnya luas, akses pantai, dekat sekali dengan bandara. Hotel lama tp terawat sekali, kamar luas dan bersih, makanan oke dan staf2nya sangat ramah dan helpfull sekali. Definitely will comeback 🫶🏻"
"34.","Rosie","25","2025-10-30","5","Resortnya luas banget.. kamarnya juga luas dan nyaman. Kolamnya luas. Akses langsung ke pantai, enak buat yang mau liburan santai di hotel aja bisa sunsetan di pantai."
"35.","MAHESHKUMAR JANI","9","2025-10-30","5","This resort is very nice, and Radhitya, who works here, is a great person. He's very helpful and a good guide too, who also guides you on the beautiful places in Bali"
"36.","Yonarisa Prahesti","17","2025-07-30","5","At the end of May, my family and I traveled to Bali and choose to stay at The Patra Bali Resort & Villas, mainly because it came highly recommended as a family-friendly hotel. Thankfully, it meet our expectations and gave us a truly memorable experience. From the moment we arrived, the staff was incredibly helpful and friendly, always ready to assist with a smile. Although the check-in process took a bit of time, the team noticed we were traveling with a baby and generously offered us a complimentary room upgrade — such a thoughtful gesture that we really appreciated. The location is ideal — just minutes from Ngurah Rai International Airport, yet the resort feels peaceful and secluded. It’s perfect for families seeking a balance between convenience and relaxation. The breakfast buffet was another highlight, offering a wide variety of dishes. There was a good selection of Indonesian and Indian cuisine, likely to cater to the many Indian tourists visiting the hotel. Everything we tried was satisfying and flavorful. A very special moment during our stay was when I received a surprise birthday cake during breakfast! It was completely unexpected and truly touched my heart. Thank you to the staff and the entire Patra Bali team for making my day extra special — it’s a memory I’ll cherish forever. 💖 The resort also features a large swimming pool that our family enjoyed every day, along with easy beach access and a scenic jogging track for morning walks by the ocean. The kids club is spacious and well-stocked with toys and games. While the facility itself is a bit dated, it still offers everything children need to play and have fun safely. Overall, our stay at Patra Bali was filled with warmth, kindness, and genuine hospitality. It's a perfect choice for families looking for a relaxing and caring environment. We left with happy hearts and hope to return again someday."

"38.","Giovanni P","6","2025-04-30","5","We just stayed a few nights at Patra Resort and had a really lovely experience. The location is super convenient—very close to the airport—which made our arrival and departure easy. I was a bit concerned after reading some reviews about possible noise from the airport, but honestly, I didn’t hear a thing. It was calm, peaceful, and really easy to sleep. The resort has multiple swimming pools, and the adults-only one was especially quiet and relaxing. Breakfast was another highlight, with a great selection of fresh options, including meals prepared on the spot. The staff were very welcoming and attentive, always making sure everything was just right. Overall, I’d definitely recommend this resort for a comfortable and restful stay."
"39.","Wiraguna Goes Bali","38","2025-10-30","5","An amazing experience at The Patra Bali! Peaceful atmosphere, friendly staff, complete facilities, and delicious food. A perfect place to relax, learn, and enjoy the beauty of Bali. Three wonderful days at The Patra Bali! Peaceful place, friendly people, and truly memorable moments. Thank you, The Patra Bali! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"40.","Alex Maj","31","2025-06-30","4","We booked and called through before our arrival to say we need two twin bed push together as have little ones, we got confirmation that was easily done, our flight got delayed for 8 hours and we arrived at hotel ground looked amazing upon arriving they sure looked better as you wonder grounds, but we got to reception and got held up, told we had to wait which was very annoying considering checking was a day before, we arrived at our room eventually was a king so was not what we wanted, it wasn’t to great so we went had breakfast, our option was to leave or check out other room and villas, we payed upgraded and decide to stay, breakfast was good with large variety, main pool was amazing and you could watch planes roll in every 2 min and land while lazing by pool was cool, our new accomodation for next 3 days was exactly what me and my family expected from a resort in Bali, if I could give anyone advise though don’t opt for the cheaper rooms there not 5 star by any means. Kid club here is amazing with Dina so lovely and attentive to toddlers, she went above and beyond, I would stay here again because of her great work running the kids club making my little ones feel welcomed."
"41.","Joe","65","2025-07-30","1","“Travel isn’t always pretty. It isn’t always comfortable. Sometimes it hurts, it even breaks your heart. But that’s okay. The journey changes you; it should change you.” – Anthony Bourdain The Patra in Kuta, Bali, has been a recurring character in our family’s story for over 15 years—a once-beloved haunt where the sunsets painted the sky in fiery hues and the ocean whispered promises of escape. But on our most recent visit, the script flipped. What was once a familiar embrace felt more like a weary handshake from an old friend who’s let themselves go. The Patra, it seems, has lost its soul, and I’m not sure it’s coming back. Let’s start with the lowlight, the kind of moment that makes your blood run cold in a way that no tropical heat can thaw. Our kids—6 and 9, full of the reckless joy that only a hotel pool can ignite—were tossing a ball, laughing, living their best Bali life. Enter a group of grown adults, who, in a display of staggering immaturity, demanded the kids hand over the ball or face a beating. Yes, you read that right. Grown men threatening children over a pool toy. In a Western city, this would’ve been a police report faster than you can say “child endangerment.” We marched straight to management, hearts pounding, expecting swift action. Instead, we got shrugs. Silence. The offenders carried on, unbothered, while the hotel’s moral compass spun like a broken weathervane. You don’t get to call yourself a family-friendly resort if you let this slide, Patra. Safety isn’t just a buzzword; it’s a promise, and you broke it. The room—oh, the room. We shelled out for one of the pricier ones, expecting a touch of luxury, or at least basic upkeep. What we got was a museum of neglect. Every door handle groaned like a haunted house prop, every door squealed in protest when opened, as if begging for WD-40. Lights flickered or flat-out refused to work, casting the room in a gloom that felt more like a cave than a tropical retreat. Stains on the curtains whispered of better days, and the shower? A temperamental beast that couldn’t decide if it wanted to scald or freeze us. It’s as if maintenance checked out years ago and left a Post-it note saying, “Good luck.” The property itself is a crumbling relic. Bricks are missing from walkways, scattered like the ruins of some ancient civilization that forgot how to care. The gazebo’s decking is a minefield of loose timber and protruding nails—our tetanus shots were up to date, thankfully, or we’d have been playing a dangerous game of “guess the infection.” It’s not just neglect; it’s a hazard, plain and simple. The Patra seems to be sleepwalking through its own existence, cobbling together half-baked ideas to recapture its former glory. Spoiler: it’s not working. Then there’s the evening entertainment, or what passes for it. A live DJ by the main pool, pumping out tunes laced with profanity and odes to strippers, while kids—kids—are still splashing nearby. Look, I’m no prude, but there’s a time and place for adult anthems, and a family-friendly pool at 7 p.m. isn’t it. The Patra seems to have an identity crisis, unsure if it wants to be a hedonistic nightclub or a kid-friendly resort. Pick a lane, folks. But it’s not all doom and gloom. Yet, even Bali’s magic can’t redeem a place that fails its guests on the fundamentals. The security, for instance, is theater at best. Guards “check” cars with mirrors but barely glance down, performing a pantomime of safety that feels as hollow as the hotel’s response to our complaint. A hotel that doesn’t take violence seriously doesn’t deserve your trust. It’s a gut-punch realization, one that lingers like the aftertaste of a bad meal. Would I return? Probably not. The Patra feels like a place that’s given up, coasting on its prime location while the cracks—literal and figurative—grow wider. For us, the scales tip heavily toward “never again.”"
"42.","Amrutha Jayavelu","5","2025-08-30","1","Horrible experience! The below average food to horrible customer service and house keeping. Rooms old and falling apart. The door lock to the room don't work, the fridge in the room doesn’t work. Our electricity went out and it took 3 calls to get someone to come look. Absolute waste of Money."
"43.","pritha chakrobarty","17","2025-10-30","2","I had high expectations from the hotel but let me down..Dirty beach..delayed service..rooms allotted far apart eventhough we booked 3 months before. Breakfast was good."
"44.","Donna P77","178","2025-05-30","5","We stayed here for our last night in Bali and only had to pay $60AUD to stay in the room until 6pm as we had a 10pm flight. The rooms are amazing pools are great. Buffet breakfast was amazing one of the best I've seen. Staff were very accommodating and the. Check in was flawless under 5 minutes.

"46.","Tom Attenborough","63","2025-06-30","3","Convenient for the airport (and doubly so if you enjoy the sound of them taking off, and the smell of their aviation fuel wafting over your sun lounger). 20 years ago, this would probably have been a very nice place, and the initial impression from the lobby and the pool remain good. That's where it ends. The staff are friendly but appear lazy and as if they are trying to avoid doing anything. I'm sure this is down to a management issue with some underlying subtext rather than the staff themselves, but here's what I observed: Want to leave a card deposit and have things charged to your room? That seems like a feat of monumental proportions, but will eventually happen if you ask enough. Want an international power adaptor? You have to walk to the lobby and give a cash deposit, even though they (eventually) swiped your credit card on arrival. Unless you ask three times and then it will magically be possible again. Want a drink with your meal? You'll almost certainly have to walk to a different outlet, as none of the staff want to serve customers at lunch time - they are all too busy putting the plates and bowls away in the cupboards after breakfast time. It took fifteen minutes for a drink to arrive at the lobby bar, and I had to remind the staff what things the menu had promised would come with a Nasi Goreng. If you want a hotel near the airport for a rest and a swim, it's fine - but don't come expecting a resort experience. At $100 USD a night, it felt fairly reasonable for the convenient location. It needs a refit and a bit of better management."
"47.","DrTempie","23","2025-06-30","1","This is not a five star hotel. The rooms are tired and in some cases literally falling apart. We had three rooms with all Varying issues. Broken shower head which when you turned the water on hot the back wall of the shower and flooded the room. called the staff to come help with the shower and was told it is broken, just remove it from the hook and wash yourself that way. Towel rack falling out of the wall and cracks all through out the rooms. The grounds/-gardens albeit nice (overgrown) have not been maintained at all, and it looks like the roads are falling apart, with large potholes and half completed maintenance. Staff levels are not sufficient to service the three pools that they have (main pool is beautiful) and the prices are high for the quality of food that you get. I am sure that sometime ago this hotel was amazing, but right now it is tired/dated and needs a lot of improvements."
"48.","Moch Faisal Karim, PhD","133","2025-05-30","5","We stayed at Patra Resort for two nights and were pleasantly surprised. Although it’s a state-owned property—technically a subsidiary of Pertamina—it’s very well-maintained. The design may feel a bit classic, but there’s a timeless charm to it that makes the experience memorable. Each room is essentially its own villa. The smaller villas are split into two levels—either you’re on the ground floor or the upper floor—and both feel spacious. The larger villas are single-storey and offer even more room to relax. The breakfast was decent—not a huge variety, but enough to start the day. The price point is reasonable, especially considering it’s a villa with good facilities. A unique touch: every morning, the staff plays Indonesia Raya, adding a nice sense of national pride to start the day. The best part? It has direct access to Kuta Beach and is just minutes from the airport. Overall, it’s definitely worth the price if you’re looking for a peaceful stay near the beach and airport."

The only thing we would say is read the laundry costs properly as we didn’t and were shocked when we got quite a large bill at the end of our stay for 3 loads of washing so would suggest taking your clothes somewhere local close by to have them washed to save you some $$"

No help in putting luggage in the car or helping with an umbrella to reach the room. Restaurants: they just have 2 Italian restaurants and one more . The menu is aligned towards the Italian and American crowd. 2/5 Pools : Huge and neat and clean. 4/5 Beaches : Dead and cannot go on beaches. There is a varuna statue near the beautiful beach. I would not recommend this place if you want to sit and relax at kuta. ."

Staff were not helpful or just rude in some cases completely ignoring us. Would not recomend coming here even more so if your Australian as they cater more for Indians and Arabs.Its a nice spot on the beach unfortunatly its no where near anything so prepre for a taxi or 20min walk to go anywhere. P.s food and drinks here are rediculessly expensive almost twice the price of Australia and 5 times more than any where else in Bali we went."

Improve your menu of breakfast and PLEASE MEANTION VEG and NON-VEG tags.Because me and spouse are pure vegetarian and we ate coffee and pasta everyday in breakfast no other options are available in resort some veg foods are too much oily. That's why I suffer from cough. Improve your Wifi facility. Even the hair dryer was not in bathroom but in room's drover at least mentioned the tag of hair dryer on drover. There wasn't sufficient water battles for us and if we want more water bottle there will too much expensive. Next time we will not come here and we will not suggest about this resort to ours friends and family. Recommendation:-add some South Indian food in your breakfast so vegetarian Indian people have something options to have. Security stuff and restaurant stuff are very kind and humble nature.

"82.","Pooja Sanikop","16","2025-01-30","1","1/5 Stars - Disappointing Experience at Patra Bali Resort My recent stay at Patra Bali Resort was marred by the extremely poor service, particularly in the restaurant and reception. The restaurant staff were inattentive, slow, and seemed completely disinterested in providing good service. Orders took an inordinate amount of time to arrive, and even then, they were often incorrect. When I politely brought this to their attention, I was met with a dismissive attitude and a complete lack of apology. To make matters worse, the room service was abysmal. I ordered a simple meal, but it took over an hour and a half to arrive. When I called to inquire about the delay, I was told that they were busy and that it would take just a few more minutes. This level of service is unacceptable, especially for a resort that claims to provide a high level of hospitality. Overall, my experience at Patrabali Resort was extremely disappointing. The staff seemed poorly trained, and the service was consistently slow and unfriendly. Unless the resort takes serious steps to address these issues, I would not recommend staying here."

And at night it all looked the same. It is near to the airport and main shopping street. I would totally recommend it to anyone. Had a great time in there. The hospitality was so too good. I would suggest to book the villa on first floor, so if it rains you're not worried about bugs or anything. Though there weren't any bugs. But for a girl it felt much safer to be on the first floor than the ground floor."

The floor needs a good scrub or wax, the pond outside needs to be urgently emptied, there is tons of bacteria on the surface and it smells. No drinks in the mini bar, my pillow had a blood stain on it, the coffee is not good either. The furniture looked tired. Please forgive me but I have to let other tourists know as we paid 200 Pounds Sterling for this for 1 night. I think even a 3 star accommodation can deliver better, we travel a lot and cleanliness is one of the most important factors when you stay somewhere. I am sure you agree with me there. The only reason we stayed here is that our flight left at 7 am and we wanted something close to the airport and I thought we would be in good hands in a 5 star hotel. The pool in the hotel is very large but after seeing the room, I doubt I would go in it as I question their capability in taking care of the pool as well. The food in the bar area was ok, but if you offer Indonesian food with sambal, please deliver sambal. I asked for it and received a surprised reply sambal? I am trying to find a few good words. You can't hear the planes, that's good."

From the moment we arrived, the staff made us feel incredibly welcome with their warm smiles and exceptional hospitality. The resort is beautifully designed, blending traditional Balinese architecture with modern comforts. The rooms are spacious, impeccably clean, and offer stunning views of the lush gardens and the serene ocean. Every detail has been thoughtfully considered to ensure guests have a relaxing and luxurious experience. The food at the resort's restaurants is delicious, offering a wide variety of both local and international dishes. I particularly enjoyed the fresh grilled meat and seafood night and the vibrant flavors of the traditional Balinese cuisine. One of the highlights of my stay was the resort's impressive pool area. It’s the perfect place to unwind, with plenty of sun loungers and attentive service. The beachfront location also provides easy access to the pristine sands and crystal-clear waters of the ocean. Overall, The Patra Resort is a true gem in Bali. Whether you're looking for a romantic getaway, a family vacation, or a peaceful retreat, this resort has it all. I can't wait to return for another unforgettable stay!"

"103.","Nas E","10","2024-12-30","1","Hotel failed to meet expectations. This is NOT a 5 star hotel! Confused at other reviews marking this hotel as clean! Did they only do half a refurb? Avoid if you are expecting comfort in your last couple of nights in Bali. We booked this hotel the night before flying back home & after affordable yet beautifully luxurious and comfortable hotels, we were met with immense disappointment. The entrance is grand and exceptional, leading to an initial false sense of security. The receptionist was on autopilot and the least friendly of all front desk experiences we’d had. She had told us our room was an upgrade but feels like a huge downgrade! Followed the bellboy into a maze of villas and it quickly became clear this is not the luxury we expected. The walls were patchy, guest dirty plates with food left out & uncleared and remained so even an hour later when we walked past again. For the sake of one night we didn’t complain but wish we had. We only used the hotel for a place to sleep before our flight yet when it came to getting into bed there was even paranoia on whether the bed itself would be clean enough as bed frame was dusty & marked. Extremely loud AC that drowned out all the external noise once turned off. Thought we’d choose a warm night in exchange for quiet only to be met with outdoor noise instead. Could not stand to be in bathroom longer than I had to. Would not be so disappointed and alarmed at everything pointed out had I actually chosen a 2 or even 3 star hotel."

"106.","YH HS","400","2025-09-30","1","Every nice 5 star resort, excellent in all aspects. Had a very relaxing stay. If any shortcomings, the quality of food at breakfast, although with many selections, could use some improvement. This is my 2nd visit, and everything seems to have gotten worse. It is Friday night at 11 PM, and some musicians (!) are still making loud noise and had been yelling through speakers, not really singing. I called front desk, they said there is no manager on duty, but they asked the people to stop at 10, since that's the curfew time, but those people just ignore them. What kind resort is this? They paid people to make ruckus and keep the guests up late at 11 pm? Also, TV is a 20 year old lcd TV with no web function and bad resolution. 5-star resort, really?"
"107.","Widodo Kadarmihardjo","8","2025-05-30","4","The beach is dirty, if it is clean then this resort will be perfect, value for money. They should at least put some effort to clean the beach. The staffs are great."
"108.","Linda Thomas","15","2024-12-30","2","The goods are that the hotel is massive, the pool is amazing and the location is great. However, the service was not great. 2 pm was checkin time but we only got the room by 2:30. They kept us waiting without any updates. We had to go to the Front office team to check the status of the room and finally at 2:30 they confirmed that the room is available but when we reached the room, the staff was still finishing up. After this the next morning the toilet flush stopped working. Quite disappointing for a 5 star to deliver such an experience. No compensation or service recovery was done. Nobody bothered or simply apologised for the experience."
"109.","Mark Vamo","10","2024-12-30","3","Friendly staff, nice location, you can walk from the airport (10 minutes). We stayed here for a day during our transit and paid 150k pp for entry. Expensive drinks/food, but nice views. Be aware, if you go to Indonesia, this is not an Indonesian expierence. If you are into luxury and western food, go here. I really recommend spending your time here during a transit."

Fantastic facilities and very close to the airport making it a breeze to get to our morning flight without all the traffic. We spent a lot of time at the pool bar with Windu and Yoga who were fantastic! The trainees too, everyone was so friendly and attentive! Rooms were clean and comfortable and everyone round the resort was always smiling and happy. Would recommend to anyone ! Thank you for a great stay!"
"111.","Lee Cherry","3","2024-12-30","1","We stayed in a 3 bedroom villa for 5 nights. Rooms were big but very dirty. I strongly recommend you to bring your own sanitizer to clean the rooms. 4 washrooms in the villa, all of them have yellow stains, 2 weren’t flushable. Supposed to have a private pool in villa, but it was very dirty with brown water in it. Staff were lazy and rude, they even allowed guests to play fireworks in midnight and my whole family woke up by the noise, not recommend you to book this hotel if you bring along young children. They said they offer private beach on website, but guests can’t really enjoy it because it was full of garbages on the sand. They supposed to have 3 restaurants in the hotel, but one was closed, and the receptionist recommended us to go to discovery mall for dinner, he said because they don’t have chefs there, whatever we order from the menu, they order from outside restaurants and bring to our table, which will take a longer time. How ridiculous! Thank you Patra for ruining our trip and impression of Bali."
"112.","Mahesh Sagar","13","2025-01-30","1","Pathetic customer service standards for a so called five-star hotel. Despite our booking includes free ‘mineral water set up’ in the villa, we didn’t get anything despite multiple follow ups. For a group of five, all we get provided was just some kind of two 300 ml bottles of some ‘home-made’ bottled water. Anything over two standard bottles and they will ask for payment…and when we explained that it’s included in our booking, the reception will apologise but will do absolutely nothing. You ring the room service, and they will keep asking for the payment. This saga continued for the entire duration of our stay, and no one was interested in either understanding or ratifying the situation. Absolutely pathetic!!! Why can’t they simply make it clear that by ‘free mineral water set up’ it means only two standard water bottles regardless of size of your group and any additional bottle will cost 20k IDR for normal water bottle and 50k-60k IDR for mineral water bottle. For the entire duration of our trip in Bali, we stayed in various accommodations, including self-contained villas, but Patra Bali is the lowest in our list. Also, you keep waiting for your luggage to arrive in your room following the check in process and it simply won’t get delivered until at least many-many follow up calls. The location and restaurant staff were amazing, but both the hotel management and room service team need to lift their game up and be honest dealing with customers. & yes, the villa we stayed was the highest of all – The Royal Villa! Noting there are so many similar hotels nearby, we won’t mind trying other place next time. We had some great expectations from this hotel, but following our two-night stay, we are not happy at all and won't recommend staying here to anyone. Good luck if you still want to try your luck!"
"113.","Russell Tearle","15","2024-12-30","1","Not sure how this place can be called 5 star. Service diabolical. Food menus average. ‘Fresh fruit juice’ is from a package not made fresh. Only good thing so far is the location. Rooms are old. The whole place seems like it needs a refit. There are rats running around outside. Very expensive and not worth the money. Plenty of better hotels just next door."
"114.","aruna bihola","7","2025-01-30","2","he hotel room was very nice; however, the service did not meet expectations. Upon arrival, I was not offered water or any refreshments, even after waiting for nearly an hour and a half for my room to be ready. Additionally, the 24-hour buggy service was unreliable, as it arrived too late, causing us to miss our flight. Lastly, housekeeping was subpar, as dirty plates were left in the room for three consecutive days without being cleared."

"117.","Fred Gohsman","116","2024-12-30","3","I expect quite a bit from a 5 star rated resort and the Patra fell short. To be fair, at times service was great, the pool was nice for the kid, and breakfast was quite diverse. However, the negatives kind of soured our stay. For us, issues with the room, directions and service at the restaurant brought our rating down. We ate at the Italian restaurant on Thursday and had a nice experience. We were provided with a nice assorted bread basket before our food came and had tasty wood fired pizzas among other tasty plates. On Sunday evening, however, at the same restaurant, we were told that the pizza was not available any more, even though an hour later we noticed the pizza station was going strong with neighboring tables enjoying. After a long day, the kid was hungry and cranky. After waiting a while, we had to ask for the bread assortment, they brought it but it was just kind of thrown on the table. After dinner, we ordered dessert. Only after ordering, we were told that a few items were not available. When it came, the creme brulee which the easier referred to as Cream Rule was pretty much baked egg; no could stand more than a bite. Of course, they didn't bring any spoons to eat the dessert with. After asking twice, they provided giant soup spoons. The waiters shirt said that he was in training but it would seem that no one had trained him nor the rest of the staff. The room had several issues including stinky bathroom, leaking shower, bin functioning dust bin, rusted tub, cob webs, and lack of towels. After a week's stay calling room service every day to provide towels, on the last night the room service man tried to scold my wife, telling that they don't provide bath towels for children. When he did show up with the towels, my wife felt threatened by his demeanor; as though he was trying to at some sort of chauvinistic superiority. What a way to end a stay at their resort! Lastly, we dumped a bunch of rupiah at the spa. The problem was the directions to the spa were flat out wrong and deceiving. But when asked, none of the staff seemed to have any clue where the spa was located."
"118.","trupti shivalkar","58","2024-12-30","4","We stayed here for 3 nights last week. It is located next to the airport & that is its main advantage. Amazing property considering its location, facilities and cost of each night. Our Deluxe Suite was very comfortable. It was generously sized, well laid out, and absolutely spotless. The room - and the hotel's common areas - had clearly been given a good refurbishment and were well maintained."
"119.","Steve & Emily Bako","3","2024-12-30","2","Not what I was expecting. Decided to stay here the last night of our trip as it was close to the airport. Though the staff are friendly and the landscaping is nice, the rooms and food did not meet my expectations. The room is very plain and dated. I found the bed uncomfortably hard and the locked door between our room and another guests room was so thin that I could hear every word and every sound coming from next door. The bathroom was very outdated and in need of repair. The bath tub enamel had peeled away and rusted on the inside, and there were ants on the floor, having entered from one of the cracks. The wifi router flashed a bright green light that lit up the room, and I was thankful to have brought an eye mask and earplugs. We tried the food at both the Italian restaurant and the restaurant serving Indonesian food. Having spent the last week travelling across Bali and tasting true Indonesian food I can only describe the food at Patra as well-intentioned, Americanized and bland. In conclusion, if you are looking for a budget hotel with close proximity to the airport this may be an option for you. It certainly is not a 5 star hotel by any means, but it will provide a roof over your head, friendly service and lovely pool access. The sunset view is nice also."
"120.","naomi ginn","5","2025-01-30","1","This resort is the BIGGEST SCAMMERS. they lied about location, Resort is directly next to airport. My shower was covered in mold, My sister in laws room reeked of filth. maintenance of this resort is so poorly kept once you exit the lobby / main pool. Reception rang my room 5 hours after ordering room service @ 11:30pm while we were sleeping to collect our plates, only for them to never collect them. They force you to pay for drinks and room service immediately when you order as it “cannot be charged to the room” then presented us with a bill for all the same items that were already paid for at the end of our stay. As we did not think to get a receipt we were again forced to pay for everything again. This resort has TRUELY ruined my experience of Bali and i will never recommend anyone i’ve ever met to go here"

The staff here were very friendly, very happy to help and had great attention to detail. I only stayed 1 night so my experience was short but I found the room to be clean, comfortable and up to my expectation. The breakfast was adequate, like everywhere in Indo there are flies hovering at every morsel of food so fruit and salad was questionable but their range was decent. As it’s next to the airport I did hear planes landing and’s taking off but that’s to be expected. Overall a positive experience for a very short stay."

"127.","Ruhane Kapil Anand","9","2024-12-30","1","We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights and it was the most disastrous experience. Firstly they gave us a really old furnished and stinky room (207) then on requesting they changed it and shifted us to other room (320). Room 320 was a beautiful looking room but to our shock there were so many insects in it. Daily we had to call the housekeeping to clean it. They offered to change the room after we shared the pictures to our agent and this offer was made late at night. All our activities were booked so we had to go for them as well in the day as we were just there for 5 nights. And anyway we had no guarantee that the next room will be clean or not as it is not at all a well maintained property. We also had a lizard in the room which was horrifying. Also, there’s no Indian breakfast at all whereas there were so many Indians staying here. This property is very near to the airport but any nearby market is accessible through a cab only. I don’t recommend anyone especially with kids to stay in this property."
"128.","wulan widya","17","2024-12-30","2","The plus point is only the location near the airport so it is good if we want to catch a flight. However the room is old, dirty looking wall, and their service is so lacking. For example, I asked for hairdryer because the room has no hairdryer and took them forever to bring it to me. More importantly, why the staffs didn’t check if the room had everything before accepting the guest in the first place. I am totally feel disappointed."

The furniture in the rooms is a little bit old-fashioned, but they are working continuously on renovation. You can relax next to one of the pools, which is a perfect place to see the wonderful sunset. The staff and their hospitality are amazing; we were lucky to try new Patra Bali signature cocktails as well. I hope this was not the last time we visited this Resort."

However very clean & very friendly service. Food was probably more authentic than we had on our entire trip - delicious 😋 the grounds were a bit dated but the pool area was fantastic & a stone throw from the beach. You could see planes landing during day as airport is only 1km away and the sound of the planes didnt bother us at night as we were tired & it was late when we arrived. Overall pleasantly delighted. I would recommend."

Reviews here must be fake. the hotel listed as 5 stars which is something I don’t understand. Pictures speaks for itself. Stay away from this hotel and don’t ruin your bali stay here."

The property is very huge put up in a vast area... require golf carts to move around....every time we miss out the route to reach the reception/restaurant. The room was very good, spacious and clean, but distance from reception/restaurant is a major issue. As the hotel lobby and reception is under repair, the hotel was kind enough to give us complimentary dinner on both the days for the inconvenience caused by the construction activity. It was nice of them to have offered this to us. The breakfast was yummy. Their restaurant faced the beach... Only negative point would be distance to cover inside the property and also there were no markets closeby... But for these, the stay was quite good."

We stayed in one of the smallest rooms and found that the room is dirty, smelly, there's lots of noise, the rooms are old, and the bathroom is a disaster. There are much better villa's for this price that are at similar key locations with service as good as, if not better than Patra Resort. You just may not be able to play tennis."

But some furnitures really need to be upgraded, it's very old (but I can still feel the lux in it tho). The breakfast was so-so, but the hospitality of their staff was top notch. It'a very near to the Bali airport (you can just walk for about 10 mins from airport with no hassle), but it feels like you're in some remote private area. Good job Patra!"

We began our 2 week long trip with a 4 night stay at the Embassy Suite and ended it back there with a 2 night stay. Since it was my sister’s 60th birthday they even sent a small surprise pastry and candles. The beach outside is amazing, quiet yet connected to all the fun activities. Don’t worry about flight sound, you’ll get the best sleep and their breakfast spread is superb. On the last day my sister was a bit unwell and they went out of their way to help us. I am definitely staying here again on any future visits. In fact, this is one of the few senior citizen friendly hotels and if you are travelling with a big family, Patra is ideal. I do have one grouse though. It would be nice if they make the entire breakfast zone non smoking. The place is fully open and even if you sit inside in the non smoking section, away from the poolside tables, you still get to inhale second hand smoke. Ruins your morning completely"

We unfortunately only has two pillows for our entire king size bed. room service never arrived, when we phoned back we were told that our order was accidentally never placed. The resort entrance to the beach side is shocking. It is covered in litter and the walkway is dirty and unkept. The pools are nice and the staff are friendly and helpful most of the time. The lobby is very welcoming and makes you feel like this is an amazing place, as you wonder into the abyss of rooms sprawled through the place, you get a true sense of the lack of upkeep and maintenance required to render this place into the five star resort it presumably once was. The resort is a 20-30min walk away from along the nearest mall which features most western restaurants and outlets. This is a good stroll along the beach where you will no doubt encounter the locals trying to sell you something. A two and half star hotel at best."

I liked the breakfast, I thought it was okay. Nothing fancy. There was a walking path or trail along the nearby beach. I didn't get to fully explore the place. The room was adequate and served my needs. The place is in need of some updates."

"162.","Thomas Hsiao","8","2024-12-30","4","We had ants issue in our room and staff took care of it immediately and upgrade us to another room. Unfortunately it seems like the ants are in the entire villa. I was afraid to eat anything in my room because I noticed they were crawling on my balcony as well even though the new room didn't have ants. Location is superior right beside the airport. Private beach is quite dirty so most guest only stayed by the pool which is a shame... I booked here for the private beach. Hotel dinner lobster was dry so it was quite disappointing and Pina colada tasted like cough syrup it was bad... Breakfast buffet was good though."
"163.","Souryadip Banerjee","66","2024-12-30","3","This is going to be a mixed review. There are many pros and equally numerable cons. I stayed there with my family in the end of December 2023. Pros The main pool- Located just by the beach, it is clad with regional decor and a sunken bar to its left. It Is quite big and service in and around the pool is rapid. Everything was clean, systematic and 0 complaints. There’s plenty of space even if it is busy. The Bar by the pool has really fast service and drinks are reasonably priced judging by the quality and swiftness. There is direct access to the Kuta beach through here, but the beach here is not particularly breathtaking. It is advisable to enjoy the pool and only the view of the beach/ocean. This pool has to be one of the key reasons of staying here, Its really beautiful. Proximity to airport- Given the dire state of traffic conditions in Bali, if you are looking to stay in the nearest decent hotel/beach near to the airport, this is the answer. This is the closest resort to the Denpasar airport. You can literally see planes landing from your resort. Food quality- In general, quality of regional Balinese food was amazing and reasonably priced by 5 star standards. The breakfast spread was amazing and vast with something from all main cuisines. Resort grounds- The scale of the resort is quite big and at no time did it feel needlessly vast. The grounds are quite expansive and has a nice tropical vegetation setting. There are 3 pools all parallel to the beach and lounge areas by the beach every 15-20 meters. Cons Communication- Biggest problem I faced was the half of the staff were trainees and they did not understand proper English at all. And the worse part is, instead of asking me to repeat something, they nodded and smiled at basically everything. It took me 2 days to get used to how to communicate with the waiters/staff here. Every time, I had to search for the senior staff member to make sure my order was correctly placed and there was no miscommunication. Had to speak really slow and even use sign language at times to make sure everything was clear. Need of renovation in rooms- The condition of rooms from inside are quite good however once you step out in the balcony, you can find the exterior falling apart at places and at some places sheer lack of maintenance. Rusted columns, unclean ponds, destroyed paint on the walls, etc. The drainage in the bathroom was faulty, it kept smelling at random intervals and had nothing to do with our usage. Slow service- In many cases, it took us 30 minutes to even receive a bucket of ice or a blanket. I am referring to services only related to room service and housekeeping. I dont know if it is because of being understaffed or miscommunication but it was pretty annoying. At one point, I gave up and just ran to the reception to get stuff. I personally enjoyed my stay here after the 2nd day when I realised what does not work in the hotel. It is a really nice property but definitely needs a renovation in certain places and better staff to cater to guests. 70% of the guests are tourists and speak English, so that is a necessity."

View pantai dibelakang hotel sangat menarik sekali."
"168.","Annie Sprague","25","2024-12-30","5","So clean and traditional Bali with gorgeous artworks and statues and a magnificent wall mural on entry. Breakfast was comprehensive with plenty of choices and, excellent late coffee with my breakfast. Last night we had the Nasi Goreng Special with a lobster, and rendang and sate lilit and fried rice. Absolutely delicious 😋. The grounds are extensive and very well maintained. And I love watching the staff riding around on bicycles because there is so much space. Lots of quiet and private spaces to relax in. We spent one whole day relaxing and swimming with 2 loungers on one of the many Bale’s. Even though it’s close to the airport the place is extremely quiet at night and we never heard an aeroplane. Plus, the AC is able to be turned up to 24*C if it’s too cold inside the bedroom. Happy to recommend 👌🏽"

Bapak menginap disini? Dan pertanyaan-pertanyaan yang meragukan saya menginap disini. Mungkin karena saya hanya masuk menginap dengan menggunakan mobil Brio. Saya berani jamin ketika saya pakai mobil Alphard mungkin tidak akan ditanya-tanya. Poor you Hotel Patra."

"173.","Arjen Thonen","47","2023-12-30","1","Terrible place that is outdated and nothing like shown on pictures. How on earth is this a 5 star hotel?! 2 at best I would say. Everything is old, ugly and broken. There was construction going on which was not mentioned when booked. The pool looked liked an abandoned place, the grass was totally dry and brown, the beds were rusty and nasty, there was trash and cigarettes on the floor and to top it all off terrible music. The fountain in front of the swimming pool looked like sewer water was coming out, water was all brown and dead leaves everywhere in the water, like where is the maintenance here? Only good thing is that it is close to the airport but seriously don’t expect anything near a 5 star experience."
"174.","Suci Ayunda","145","2023-12-30","4","Kami menginap 2 malam di kamar premium. Ditipe ini terdapat ruang tamu dan terdapat bathub dikamar mandi. Resort terdiri dari bangunan-bangunan Villa yang terdapat beberapa kamar dalam satu bangunan. Terdiri dari 2 lantai di setiap bangunan. Resort sangaat luas sehingga kalau dapat kamar agak belakang, agak jauh ke pantai dan restorannya. Tapi tenang ada buggy yang setiap saat bisa di telpon dan cepet respon-nya. Ekspektasi saya akan cukup berisik suara pesawat karena lokasi sangat dekat dengan bandara. Ternyata tidak, malah cukup tenang suasananya dan view sunsetnya bagus banget plus ada view pesawat hehe. Kekurangannya hanya kemarin toilet agak bau dan bocor."
"175.","Iska Aditya Nugraha","529","2023-12-30","5","Sangat dekat dengan bandara, jika kalian dari bandara bisa lah jalan saja ke hotel ini Hotelnya memang model yang bukan tumbuh keatas, jadi seperti cottage2 gitu. Memang Patra jasa hotel konsepnya hampir2 mirip, di SMG, Cirebon, juga seperti ini. Reception sangat ramah, setiap yang datang dikasih welcome drink Kamarnya luas sekali, cocok buat yang suka salto2, bisa kesana kemari. Suasananya sepi dan enak buat kalian yang ingin pergi dari hiruk pikuk perkotaan. Didalam hotel ini langsung ke pantai, ada kolam renang juga yang terawat, banyak tempat duduknya. Dari pantai ini jika berjalan 2KM sudah sampai kuta, kalau kalian pelari bisa mencoba track ini Makanannya variasi, enak, level bintang 5 Semoga bisa berkunjung kembali"

"178.","Stella Marie","4","2024-12-30","5","We had a wonderful stay at the Patra hotel. The cottage was huge beautifully decorated with traditional balinese style and the location was just great with easy access to the beach. The breakfast each morning was superrr..full variety of western, indonesian, chinese, indian...we had problem with our bathtub, which always leaking resulting flooding in our bathroom but it's not realy a big deal for us since the housekeeping was super efficient, they always came to our room less than 5 mins after we called them ..All the staff are friendly, helpful and they really make you feel like part of their family and give wonderful support in every need of your visit..we will certainly stay here again next time we are in Bali."
"179.","Simranjeet Kaur","31","2023-12-30","4","Very nice and clean quiet place to stay near airport in Bali. Big huge pool with beautiful sunset view which took my breath away. But still I hold 1 star for breakfast service and spa. Breakfast served was cold and everything finished before time. And I think if u r looking for spa for relaxation in ur resort then this is not the resort. Spa closes very early and opens late. Staff is very polite , friendly and welcoming. Kids club is big enough to keep them busy. We had a good family time in the resort."
"180.","Bagus Mulyawan","10","2022-12-30","4","Merasakan pengalaman pertama menginap di The Patra selama 3 hari 2 malam. Nuansa hotel bergaya tradisional, dengan ratusan kamar dengan konsep resort dan villa. Kami menginap dengan kamar konsep resort (2 lantai, connecting tangga diluar kamar) dengan tipe deluxe suite (73 sqm). 1. Hospitality. 8/10. Saat proses reservasi, operator/marketing cukup responsif dan ramah. Ketika tiba check in, langsung dibantu oleh petugas yang membantu membawakan koper dari kendaraan. Disambut ramah oleh receptionis serta ada welcome drink. Petugas hotel juga memiliki keramahan yang baik, serta operator telp yang cukup responsif. Namun, saat akan check out, tidak ada petugas yang menawarkan bantuan saat kami akan membawa barang ke kendaraan. 2. Kamar/Villa. 8/10. Kami ambil 2 kamar deluxe suite yang konsep resort di posisi lantai 1 dan bersebelahan (adjacent). Kesan pertama, ruangan kamar cukup dingin dan rapi. Aminities, furniture dan pelengkap kamar lainnya, tertata cukup rapi dan bersih. Tersedia payung. Kamar terdiri dari kamar utama dan living room, tidak ada pantry. Telp kamar ada 3 buah. Tv ada 2 buah. Kamar mandi bathup dan tersedia shower. Terdapat peta area hotel di pintu masing-masing kamar. Tirai kayu di kamar mandi tidak bisa di adjust buka-tutup, tapi cukup tidak terlihat dari luar. Petunjuk kiblat masing-masing kamar tidak sama, ada yang terpasang di plafon dan ada yang terdapat di laci lemari (harus cek-cek). 3. Kebersihan. 7,5/10. Area publik di lingkungan hotel terlihat bersih dan terawat. Untuk kamar juga cukup bersih, terawat dan beberapa bagian terlihat baru direnovasi. Area restoran indoor dan outdoor cukup bersih. Main pool juga bersih dan terawat. Namun, ada beberapa area publik hotel yang tertutup (close). Mungkin tidak difungsikan karena sepi kunjungan saat pandemi. Halaman kecil di sekitar kamar yang masih banyak sampah dari daun tanaman hotel. Serta ada tokek yang berada di dalam kamar. 4. Sarapan. 7/10. Tersedia coffe bar jika menginginkan latte atau cappucino dll. Egg station cukup lengkap sajiannya dan bisa menyajikan sesuai ekspektasi. Sajian sarapan buffet. Menu main course kurang variasi, untuk rasa yang rata-rata. Saat banyak tamu, beberapa manu main course sudah habis lebih cepat. 5. Dinner. 7/10. Sajian dinner secara ala carte. Pilihan menu secara paket dan hanya ada 3 paket tersedia, seharusnya bisa lebih variatif. Untuk rasa sajian cukup lebih baik dari pada menu saat sarapan. 6. Fasilitas. 7,5/10. Restauran buka 24 jam. Tersedia buggy car untuk didalam area hotel. Papan informasi dan petunjuk arah area hotel tersedia cukup banyak, sangat membantu jika berjalan sendiri. Memiliki 2 pool, 1 main pool dan 1 pool khusus untuk dewasa. Namun pool khusus untuk dewasa sedang maintenance. Untuk kelengkapan swimming, hotel hanya menyediakan handuk, tidak ada pelampung, kacamata renang dll. Kursi tunggu di lobby tidak cukup banyak saat ramai pengunjung. Beberapa spot area tidak cukup penerangan saat malam hari. 7. Wifi dan saluran tivi. 7/10. Koneksi wifi cukup baik dan mudah. Saluran tivi lokal dan internasional. Namun, koneksi wifi saat di area terbuka tidak tersambung. Saluran tivi internasional hanya 3/4 chanel saja. 8. Lokasi. 8,5/10. Salah satu hotel dengan spot terbaik di pesisir barat bali. Hotel berbatasan dengan bibir pantai. Menyajikan pemandangan sunset dan perahu nelayan. Sebagian kamar, ada yang tipe ocean view. Bersebelahan dengan bandara, sehingga menambah hiburan untuk anak. Namun, cukup banyak anjing liar berkeliaran (tidak mengganggu). Pasir pantai putih-hitam. 9. Keamanan dan privasi. 9/10. One gate system. Portal buka tutup dan dijaga oleh petugas. 10. Service dan lainnya. 9/10. Saat delivery makan dari luar hotel, diantar oleh petugas hotel. Kemudian ojek motor diijinkan masuk sampai area dekat drop off. Seragam petugas hotel cukup baik. Rekomendasi: 1. Sajian menu bisa lebih baik dan variatif, untuk standard hotel bintang 5. 2. Kebersihan lingkungan villa bisa lebih baik dan rapi. 3. Fasilitas yang belum berfungsi dan belum optimal, semoga bisa segera difungsikan kembali dan lebih optimal."

Menginap di sini pas Ramadhan, buka puasa disediakan makanan yang enak. Sayang saat sahur hanya buffet makanan biasa, buah dan minum saja. Kelengkapan breakfast yang biasanya lengkap, belum tersedia. Jarak antar kamar agak jauh dari ballroom lokasi kegiatan dan sempat nyasar karena berbelok-belok jalannya. Lokasinya dekat bandara, dekat pantai juga. Ada monumen jg di tepi pantainya."

"183.","Rakhmawati Ningrum","12","2023-12-30","3","Unfortunately we read the bad reviews after it was booked for us for a night. We couldn't change it as it was non refundable. We ignored the distance, renovation, old furniture, mosquitoes and even a lizard in the bathroom, as it was just for a night. Then we experienced sewage smell in the water from all the taps. The water was brown literally at the start. They send house keeping twice to fix it but the smell was constant. This is unforgivable because we didn't take bath or wash ourselves. We had children and we could get infected if it was unnoticed. They seriously need to pause taking further bookings and fix all their issues and renovate this outdated resort then continue."

The wall painting was peeling, grease on the walls, spider webs all over there - under the tables, under the wall pictures. Old and yellow AC.

Hotelnya cukup luas, kalau yang hobi jalan pasti sangat menyenangkan untuk explore hotel, untuk yang gak suka jalan, tenang aja... pihak hotel sudah menyiapkan Buggy Car buat mengantar...

"191.","Sammu Uichico","6","2023-12-30","4","Large resort with multiple pools and beach access. Also has large open spaces for parties outdoors and also many meeting rooms and conference spaces that can be used. Was here for a conference for 6 days. Great meeting rooms but keep in mind that the resort area was so large some participants got lost. Conveniently located very near the airport (you can actually walk to the airport but I would recommend taking a car). However not too close to food and shopping areas (well it's about 1.8km or slightly over a mile walk to shopping and food areas) but not as pedestrian friendly to walk, you can go via the beach to get to the areas that have shopping and food but it's slightly longer. Great place for people that want a relaxed vacation and schedule or for conferences and meetings. Rooms are a bit dark (for my taste) but we got an upgraded room so it was quite large and roomy-bathroom has a separte shower and bath tub :)"
"192.","Chad Zawistowski","20","2023-12-30","5","It's definitely a resort, and close to the airport. (Noise wasn't an issue for me, but you can see the planes take off) The main downside is that you're in Kuta, which is rather overrun with tourist schlock and not the best representation of Bali culture. Still, not bad. If you're taking a yoga course the floating shala is really cool. I wasn't a student so can't speak to the quality of instruction. Powerful AC units in the rooms were very nice. I also enjoyed the pool and live Balinese music during complimentary breakfast."

However there was an issue that I faced in the beginning which was, the white coating of the bathtub in my room had gotten off and it wasn't looking at a good shape so I asked them to get it fixed. Since they said they will be unable to fix it I asked them if they can give another room, which they did. I got a different room with a shower as all the bathtub rooms were unavailable. Moreover, the breakfast provided by them didn't have a variety, mostly they served only the Bali local food, therefore food was an issue and can be a problem for vegetarians. Rest everything was perfect such as timely cleaning of the room, room service, house keeping, etc. Since it's a beach resort there's a huge area for walking and cycling, you can visit the beach frequently."

"213.","Bhaumik Bhatt","10","2024-12-30","4","One of the best scenic luxury beach hotel resort in Kuta nearby the Airport. I would have given it 5 stars but i'm giving 4 because of the only thing I didn't like about the resort. They provide two 200 ML water bottles only for one time. Then if you order one bottle they charge IDR 50,000 i.e Rs. 250 in INR. Rs. 250 for 200 ML Water Bottle which is very very expensive 🙄🙄🙄 So I'll suggest all the Indians to bring their own water bottles from stores outside the resort."

Sebelah bandara persis. Pinggir pantai kute banget. Aman karena udah ada pemecah ombaknya. Jadi mau pagi, siang, sore bolbal ke pantai juga aman, hehe. Tapi klopun tnyt gak sengaja kena luka, staf hotel siap ngebantu dengan peralatan P3Knya, ko. Jalan pinggir pantainya pun aman buat jalan/lari pagi/sore. Kolam renangnya ada 2 (not to mention kamar2 yang udah punya sendiri, yaaa), jadi bisa milih mau renang dimana. Tiap kolam renang, ada gazebonya, jadi bisa nyantai ngambil napas dulu klo kecapean, wkwk. Stafnya juga ramah2. Kekurangannya disini seperti halnya resort lain yang ga ke atas, tp ke samping, berasa jauuuh jalannya, hehe, padahal klo udah tiap hari ya ga berasa jg sih. Mobil shuttle ke kamar dari lobby ada, tp suka kekurangan tenaga yang nyetir, jadi lama nunggunya, dan akhirnya kami jalan kaki aja sendiri. Oia, kamarnya luas. Kebetulan kami dapet yang di atas, jadi bisa nikmatin udara pantai, seger banget. Balkonnya ada 2, jd bisa dapet 2 view. Nice stay, deh."

Pas mau balik k room dr lobby, dg 1 ank kecil, 2 lansia, i was waiting at the boogie point (from lobby to my room is quite distance), i already ask the staff to take us and they ask me to wait, trus security dateng sm tamu lain 1 org, my mom nanya ke securitynya bapak yg anter ya? Dan security nya tidak menjawab malah ngomong sm tamu yg dia anterin 😊 sampe tamu yg dateng belakangan itu udh naik boogie car, tamu itu yg nanya ke securitynya ibu nya nga sekalian pak? Trus securitynya ngatau jawab apa, then he left us in confused 😊 after that baru ada staff lain yg dateng (dengan 2 tamu lain yg udah disuruh naik dluan k boogie car) trus staff nya baru blg mau sekalian diantar? I got so pissed omg😭 sm turis asing aja ramah bangettt 😅 tp baca2 di kolom komen ada juga sih bule yg ngeluh hospitality nya 😅 definitely wont spend my 1,8 million rp anymore for 5 star hotel like this 😊"

Kamar 202 honeymoon villa, punya private pool, bed-nya berkelambu, plus bathtub. Swimming poolnya menghadap Pantai Jerman yang ada patungnya di tepi laut. Ada pula floating library yang bukunya kebanyakan tentang Bali, lounge untuk melihat sunset, restoran jepang, dan sebagainya.

Modelnya bungalow, banyak ruang terbuka di antara unit-unitnya. Kamar-kamar bersih, luas, dengan fasilitas lengkap. Area makan dan bar ada di antara lobi dan kolam renang yang berposisi di sisi pantai. Sangat covid-friendly karena aliran udaranya bagus. Ada juga ruang makan tertutup dan ber-AC untuk grup kecil. Kolam renang terbesar ada di dekat area makan; ada 2 kolam lagi dengan ukuran lebih kecil di sayap kiri dan kanan properti. Staf hotel melayani dengan ramah, sabar, dan kooperatif. Sulit menemukan kekurangan hotel ini, tapi yang bisa ditingkatkan mungkin makanannya—yang tidak selalu enak."

"228.","lif 's","68","2023-12-30","4","Lokasi hotel sangat dekat dengan bandar udara internasional I Gusti Ngurah Rai. Terdapat layanan antar dan jemput ke (dari) bandar udara internasional I Gusti Ngurah Rai. Terdapat kolam renang yang menghadap ke arah laut, sehingga ketika matahari terbenam, kita bisa menikmati sunset sambil berendam di kolam tersebut. Sarapan pagi disediakan di restoran yang berdekatan dengan area lobby dan kolam renang. Menu sarapan bervariasi. Kamar luas dengan beberapa bagian ruangan. Tersedia kamar yang memperbolehkan smoking. Kamar mandi juga sangat luas dengan menggunakan shower dan bath tube pada bagian sisi yang berbeda. Setiap kamar memiliki teras. Terdapat beberapa taman di dalam area hotel. Sarana parkir cukup luas dan terdapat di beberapa bagian. Terdapat beberapa ruangan untuk mengadakan acara pertemuan. Namun demikian, karena jarak lobby ke jalan umum agak jauh, cukup melelahkan bagi pejalan kaki untuk mendapatkan makanan kaki lima atau warung rokok terdekat. The location of the hotel is very close to I Gusti Ngurah Rai international airport. There is a pick-up and drop-off service to (from) I Gusti Ngurah Rai international airport. There is a swimming pool facing the sea, so when the sun goes down, we can enjoy the sunset while soaking in the pool. Breakfast is provided at a restaurant adjacent to the lobby and swimming pool area. The breakfast menu is varied. Spacious room with several parts of the room. There are rooms that allow smoking. The bathroom is also very spacious with a shower and bath tube on different sides. Each room has a terrace. There are several parks within the hotel area. Parking facilities are quite large and there are several sections. There are several rooms for holding meetings. However, because the lobby is quite far from the public road, it is quite tiring for pedestrians to find the nearest street food or cigarette shop."

"232.","Jastip Christine","4","2024-12-30","5","Had a 5-nights stay here. The room is spacious yet clean (ac was very cold to my bone🥶) but it took quite long for the hot water in the shower to get out. Since the resort area is quite big you have to walk everywhere but they offer the caddy service free for all guests to take you anywhere inside the area. The breakfast was nice. They offer varieties of indonesian, western and some indian foods. They even have nasi jinggo (traditional bali dish made of rice with various side dishes) and it tastes pretty original (compared to ones i usually have in the morning). Cuma saran aja, kwetiaunya kurang asin🥲 sama kalo bisa adain kue2 tradisional donggs kaya jajanan pasar👍 The pool is also nice and clean (the water is warm). Beach is just a walk away from the area. You can enjoy the pool while watching sunset. Staffs are friendly and helpful. Overall my stay there worth 5 stars."

Very spacious and green, so you won't feel hot even though the beach are in the backyard. Good variety of food in breakfast but it's just regular taste in lunch and dinner buffet. There are 2-3 pools in the premises. Also you can held a private party, Western and/or Balinese wedding. You won't get late to the airport & the hotel is very easy to find from the airport. because the have shuttle from & to hotel, and it's only like 500 meters from building to building. So you exit the airport parking lot and turn left, voila. There's the hotel."

The deluxe room is not deluxe at all but a standard if not tired room. Paint needing a touch up,cracked tiles etc.. The rooms are spread over a wide area and most “normal rooms” are several minutes walk away from the lobby and pool. There is a pool closer but it is reserved for villa guests. The breakfast was fine, plenty of choice and well cooked. The pool area is lovely but definitely lacking in staff, no one to be seen for drink orders on either day we were by the pool. The area need the glasses and bottles etc collected but again wasn’t done in the many hours we were by the pool. A huge disappointment after reading some of the other reviews. Definite only a one night stay if needed for the airport."

Cons: - The Patra is not as advertised. - The pool bar is currently closed - Pool toilets are dirty (mould on floor, no lights, slip hazard) and are an accident waiting to happen. - The Italian Restaurant and Japanese Restaurant are closed. - Highly understaffed and service is often hard to obtain. - Food from Hotel below par. - Location isn't ideal. Whilst we understood that our stay was on the back of the COVID pandemic, Hotels nearby seemed much more functional. After 4 days at The Patra we decided to approach management about the issues and were laughed at and told 'we will take on board' (criticism). I will be making further contact with our booking agency regarding a refund. We re-located to a resort nearer central Kuta for the rest of our trip where we were able to enjoy a fully functional Hotel and all round service."

It was my first trip to Bali and Patra was the only disappointing thing. Staff are unfriendly. Facility is highly unmaintained and dirty. Our rooms inside were full of dust. We got lizards moving inside the room. We booked 2 villas and one of the villas had sewage smell throughout. They breakfast plenty of options for breakfast but flies all over with zero hygiene. Annoying part was the hotel is under renovation now started the day we checked in but there was no indication while we booked. Throughout we could hear the construction noise. Pools are dirty and unmaintained. I heard Patra is known for government officials and delegates stay n meetings. It is semi government owned. The staff don't even bother about any feedback you provide. I paid for housekeeping, laundry n food ordered in room but the day we were checking out they asked me to pay again and they did not keep the record of bill payment and instead started asking me whether I have any receipts. I will never stay in Patra not even as a complimentary stay."

The breakfast should not be missed as there are alot of varieties with eggs, waffles, pancakes and French toast are freshly made in front of you as per your request + fresh coffee of you choice. The restaurant is by the infinity pool which is by the beach giving you a wonderful and relaxing time during the breakfast. Balinese music are played live sometimes in the restaurant during breakfast. I took a standard twin room and it was sparkly clean with a big toilet and comfy beds. The balcony was there with 2 chairs so you can relax in the morning and see the gardens."

Food is probably the area the hotel needs to improve, they are nice for indonesians but not much varietas for western breakfast. If you're looking for a nice, peaceful and secluded hotel, room for your family that won't cost you arms and legs ..you should give this hotel a try. Everyone here are soo friendly and helpful.

"274.","Gwae Decena","112","2023-12-30","5","We were on a group tour to Bali and were fortunate enough to have our accommodations booked at the Patra Bali Resort and Villas. We arrived in Bali after midnight and were shuttled to the hotel which was literally across a main road from the airport. Even though it was late, the staff greeted us with welcome leis and iced tea while we waited at their coffee shop/restaurant for our room assignments. The rooms were definitely unexpected! I thought that I'd have to bunk down in a small space with my roommate, but we got an entire vill to ourselves! It was quite a walk though from the main hotel lobby to the villas, but I was glad to see that they gave us one on the ground floor. Each building had four rooms, two on each level. Each room had its own living room complete with ameneties: television, A/C unit, table and chairs, sofa, lamp, refrigerator, water heater, and instant Bali coffee. The sliding doors here would open into a small balcony area with a table and chairs where you can sit and enjoy the scenery while having your breakfast. Going into the bedroom was a king sized bed that I just melted into, two bedside tables, a dresser, a closet. There were full length windows/sliding doors in both the bedroom and the living room. The bathroom had a toilet with bidet, bathtub, shower, sink. Hot and cold water were available and there was a closet inside the bathroom as well. Being in Indonesia they had a different type of electric socket so make sure to do your research and bring the appropriate adapter. Calling the lobby at night isn't very effective and they also have a 20% VAT fee so better to stock up on snacks if you're the type who gets hungry in the middle of the night. The restaurant serves a buffet breakfast with a variety of options, and you can choose to eat indoors and enjoy the live local instrumental music, or sit outdoors and have a view of the infinity pool. If you walk around the property, you'll eventually get to the beach which opens up into the Indian Ocean, but if you prefer, there are several pools to choose from and a lot of cabanas so you won't have to fight with other tourists for a slot. There are a lot of structures that are so picturesque and you can take a lot of memorable and instagrammable photos that you can cherish forever."

The resort and ambience are good and that's the end of the story. Rooms are old and worn out. Bathrooms are very poor, with water not draining properly. The rooms are not cleaned properly as there is so much dust on the floor and near the bed There's just a single plug to charge phone/mobile in the entire room. What made the whole experience worse is the slow service and mosquitoes. Even in ubud didn't face this many mosquitoes. Requested the hotel for repellent and housekeeping to check for the water drain issue. Had to call them four times before they sent somebody to check"

Very recommended to stay here with family. Breakfast also very tasty. The downside is the room is a bit dirty due to this is an old resort"

There are three pools and the restaurant is awesome with delicious food. I told them in a mail that I’m coming for my honeymoon and we were excited to see what they’ve done for us. The experience there was amazing. Absolutely love this place and their hospitality."
"284.","Ivan Yapari","877","2022-12-30","5","Hotel di pinggir pantai, tepat di samping bandara I Gusti Ngurah Rai. Dari kolam renangnya bisa lihat pesawat yang take off maupun landing dari jarak dekat. Memiliki akses ke pantai. Kamarnya kesan kuno tapi bersih, tidak bau dan ada bath tub. Pelayanan pegawai cepat dan ramah. Untuk sarapan prasmanan, rasanya biasa saja."
"285.","Gary Lohan","62","2019-12-30","3","My wife and I spent 3 weeks and were married here in Dec 2016, we returned in Jun 2019 to find the hotel had rebranded with new management. As always when things like this happen, the tried and tested are replaced and we could definitely tell, here's what to expect; 1- No more poolside 'happy hour.' 2- Staff cutbacks - We didn't see any waiting staff by the poolside during our stay, when we needed food and drink, we had to find them. If you've visited this hotel in the past you'll know that this can be tricky as it's a large complex. 3- Staff morale appears to be falling as they are working probably longer hours for no or little extra pay, after speaking with several members it became 100% clear that is the case. 4- Property maintenance appears to be suffering too with damaged stone work in and around the pool area, this poses a hazard particularly to children, you have been warned! 5- Regularly I found sub standard communal toilets, missing toilet roll, no soap in dispenser etc. Overall, I didn't enjoy my stay, I could easily tell that there are problems here just by looking at the staff, they are lovely people and they don't deserve to be treated this way. Our stay was only 3 days this time so I imagine there are a lot more issues behind the scenes that guests don't see! Would we stay again? Probably not whilst it's under the current stewardship, it is a lovely location and property and we have noted the improvements with the beach, however hotels must provide amenities and have staff that enjoy their work, I didn't feel that this time!"

Would be great for families or honeymooners as is in a quiet location, about 30 minutes walk down the seaside to get to the centre of Kuta but I believe they offer a free shuttle service there throughout the day if you're not keen on the walk."
"293.","Nurvani Septiani","246","2017-12-30","5","What a great place!!! Kami sangat menikmati waktu kami selama 4D3N di hotel ini. View yang bagus, kamar yang nyaman (meskipun tidak terlalu luas) dengan balkon menghadap taman. Suasana tenang dan asri. Kolam renang tepat dipinggir pantai dengan view laut, excellent. Tipe hotel yang luas dengan banyak lokasi foto menarik dan taman bermain cocok buat keluarga dengan anak-anak kecil. Semoga jika mengalami renovasi tidak banyak merubah keasrian dan kekhasan hotep ini. Karena sudah jarang kita menemukan hotel dengan suasana seperti disini. Oiya sarapannya luar biasa, banyak pilihan menu dengan rasa juara."
"294.","Joe Shurtz","38","2019-12-30","4","Stayed here 3 days waiting for a changed flight. Literally right across the street from the airport. HUGE property (curiously noise wasnt a problem). It was quite a walk from my room to the main lobby and pool area. Not a 4 or 5 star resort, but a good value for the price. Clean and well maintained. Staff was better than a lot of other resorts I stayed at. However - If youre looking to be waited on hand and foot, want prime beach access, nightlife, close access to boutique, or an amazing luxury experience, this is not your place."
"295.","Shafiq Ahmed Ghazie","425","2019-12-30","3","Hotel is located next to the airport. Arrived slight after 1PM during the hot sunny day. Check-in registration was fast. Unfortunate the room was not ready. Had to wait around 20 minutes for the room. Waited around the pool / beach area. Scenery was marvelous. Once the room is ready; they send me on buggy. Garden view room. Small in size. But ok for short stay. Toilet seems decent layout. Lighting, internet, TV and aircondition works great. Tried dinner at their coffee house. It is a halal coffee house (no worry for Muslim travellers). Food portion seems OK and pricing is moderate. Food tasted OK. Somehow I felt that the waiter/waitress need to be more attentive and more friendlier consider this hotel is not cheap. Morning breakfast spread seems decent. Food tasted OK. The hotel pool looks great on photography. Relaxing at the pool seems cool too. The beach? Not so clean. But you do get a great sunset view on a good day. Getting around? The hotel does provide limited shuttle. But you can always go for GRAB. Overall; stay here seems OK."
"296.","yudit kadang","479","2020-12-30","5","Hotel resort di dekat bandara Ngurah Rai. Tetapi bunyi pesawat lalu lalang tidak terlalu terasa. Hotelnya sangat besar dg pavilium2 2 tingkat. Bentuknya mirip semua jadi bisa tersesat salah kamar bila tidak hapal. Kolam renangnya besar dan tersedia kursi2 santai menghadap ke laut. Paviliumnya sudah agak tua, terlihat sudah agak tua barang2nya, tapi terjaga kebersihannya. Ruangannya besar lengkap dg ruang tamu, dan tempat tidurnya besar. Makan paginya sangat bervariasi dan jumlahnya banyak. Rasanya juga enak."
"297.","Denise Keegan","25","2023-12-30","3","Halfway through a 10 night stay, and we're very disappointed. We've stayed at The Patra a few times in the past (pre Covid), and had loved it. Our room this time (as a returning guest) is below standard. Admittedly we opted for a Deluxe Room as opposed to a Deluxe Suite this time for financial.reasons, but when their pictures show a walk in shower and you get a shower over an old, chipped bath, that you have to somehow climb into because it's so high..... * Our fridge is constantly running - sometimes it's cold, sometimes it's not, but it's always noisy. * There is no drying rack or clothesline to hang wet clothes/swimmers, only the holes over the bath where the clothesline used to be. * The magnifying vanity mirror in the bathroom was hanging off the wall, but it got fixed. And for the first 3 days there was a truck parked outside a conference room (right near our room) with a generator running all freaking day! The grounds are overgrown and untidy. Everything needs a thorough clean and repair. The Italian Restaurant is still advertised as being open, but there's not even a table or chair in the space. I don't know about the Japanese restaurant as I haven't bothered to look. Unless you like drinking straight alcohol, don't buy a cocktail. As this place is Government owned and wasn't shut down through Covid, there's really no excuse for the condition it is in. We won't bother coming back. Edit. We ended up paying extra and moving to a Deluxe Suite for the last 5 nights, which was in the next building. The room was in much better condition, but still not up to standard. * The fridge was quiet ✓ * There was a clothesline over the bath ✓ * There was a walk in shower ✓ * The bath in this room was in pretty bad condition. It was clean, but looked awful. * You couldn't sit on the lounge - the dip in the middle was so bad that you could actually see it. * The toilet was running 24/7. Pointed it out to housekeeping, but wasn't fixed or even looked at. * The light was always on in the wardrobe. Nothing a screwdriver wouldn't fix (door needed adjusting), so we wedged a bit of paper over the door to press on the switch. On day 7 of the stay, they actually started mowing the grounds. By the time we left it was starting to look a lot better. Best of all THE TRUCK WITH THE GENERATOR CAME BACK! Another 3 days with a generator running all freaking day! Woo hoo! Still won't be going back......"

I would give 5 stars if they would pay more attention to tiny details like shower curtain, add more pillows, change the curtain to plain fabrics, wipe clean the air vent, change the table lamp and the most important: add additional light in the room because I think the room is too dim. The rest is good. Good price, good service, friendly staff, good location, comfy bed, private beach, quiet room, nice kids club, nice tasty bfast with wide variety."

Staff was awesome, very accommodating to any requests and give great suggestions. Only caveat to that is make sure you take their sponsored tours with a grain of salt, anything you buy there will be marked up to an insane degree, you can get it cheaper at the main mall."
"307.","ariyami khansa","61","2021-12-30","5","Hotel di pinggir laut. Berjalan di sepanjang pantai sampai puas. Atau menikmati deburan ombak sepanjang hari. Berenang di kolam luasss ditemani suara deburan ombak. 👍 Kamar luas sangat, nyaman. Kami butuh shower yang bisa digantung di dinding agar mandi terasa lebih bersih dan mudah. Mandi atau berendam? Hanya pakai bath tub. Saluran pembuangan air di lantai jauuh dari sisi bath tub, tidak ada gorden penutup, akhirnya air banyak menggenang di bawah, kamar mandi jadi sangat licin. Dan berbahaya untuk tidak waspada. Plus kami butuh cantolan untuk baju di kamar mandi. (213) Sarapan selama tiga hari dengan menu yang sama. Pelayanan, ramah dan baik."

The buildings, the garden, trees, and overall look just pretty ordinary and unmaintained. The room is big, but not a nice ambience. The outdated and merky look probably due to long pandemic which is fair. Not recommended if you looking for relaxing, peaceful holiday place. It's ok for transit tho. Close to the airport, you can literally see it from the yard. I hope more visitors coming to Bali, and the hotel can improve its quality."

"332.","M. D.","248","2018-12-30","3","Could have been great, but just wasn't. It was the little things that shouldn't have been an issue that compel me to give only three stars. The facility is nice, but it's huge. The hotel is designed like an appartment complex. Our room was almost a 10 minute walk from the pool. When you're on vacation, that's a hike. It's also really hard to find your way around, especially at night, because the grounds are so large. It was too easy to take a wrong turn and miss your room; and all the units look the same, so there's no reference points to go on. The overall feel of the hotel was more like a Florida retirement complex where everyone drives around in golf carts. You have to sign out a beach towel, but if you arrive too late to the pool (say at 3 p.m.) the towels might be all gone. So back to your room you go to get your bath towel. The pool also closes too early. The staff were friendly and generally helpful. The hotel is conveniently located within easy walking distance of the airport, so it's a good choice if, like us, you want to stay a night or two in town before or after spending most of your time in the Balinese countryside."

The pool was well managed and clean that looks remarkable from any angle you look at it. It is placed on the beach and has easy access to it. Even at late night, walking on the beach felt secure. The bar at 'The Patra Bali Resort & Villas' had refreshing options to choose from the menu. The staff was very generous and friendly. They do offer fast Wi-Fi along with a paid options to surf on the internet with a computer. I felt that the room had less space, and the same goes for the bathroom."

Secondly, the water pressure is so low and I can't even bathe! We asked for the team to check it out but it didn't solve the issue. Luckily we are only staying here doe 2 nights. Toiletries like toothbrushes are extremely bendy, and there was a whole hoard of mosquitoes accompanying us to sleep. No more next time!"

The staff and chefs don’t know what is vegan or vegetarian. They put fried eggs and cheese on top of foods even when I asked many times. The staff is kind overall but the middle aged lady in the reception was not kind. She was rolling her eyes when I told her about the cockroaches."

Good food, great service and delicious cocktails . We weren't actually stay here but somewhere else. But that whereabouts had per misfortune to give our stay to another, so we came to The Patra. Happiness in an accident we came to this paradise. And from now The Patra is gone be one of the places I will go back to every time I go to Bali!"
"348.","張dahaogo","135","2018-12-30","4","Staff were awesome and always smile and willing to help. We stayed 3 nights in two different deluxe suites. rooms are old but ok, the toilets were leaking all the time that’s quite annoying especially at night. Breakfast was ok, but the coffee and bread/croissant were not good. Nice clean big pool next to the beach and great sunset there. Unsatisfactory: only two small bottle of water per day even in family room, we had to carry bottled water from city everyday. Rent bicycle 25k/hr from hotel that’s ridiculous, I stayed in other hotels in bali that bikes were free for 2-3hrs. Location is next to airport means 10mins drive but aircrafts noise all day long, and if you check out google map, the resort is very close to some huge gasoline tanks."

"352.","david williams","239","2018-12-30","3","This place is poorly managed. Guests will put a towel on a beach chair and leave it there all day. Only to return after you have watched the tile laid there for two hours and decided to take over the chair then they show up and want to argue with you. The hotel should enforce its own rules of not leaving your chair more than 30 minutes. But they do not enforce their own rules causing fighting and animosity between the guests. This is not what I came to a five-star hotel for. And oh by the way the food at there Balinese restaurant is just terrible. The hotel is overpriced poorly managed. That being said most of the staff is very helpful and friendly. I wish the general manager was just doing a better job. We will not return"
"353.","Nafhan","48","2018-12-30","5","Hotel ini sangat cocok untuk berlibur sebab hotel ini memanjakan pengunjungnya karena hotel ini ada pantai yang bagus dan apabila mengikuti jalan setapak bisa mengarah ke pantai KUTA BALI. Bagi kalian yang suka hunting pesaeat lokasi ini sangat pas karena cukup ke arah pantai lalu kalian bisa hunting pesawat landing sebab hotel berada di sebelah bandara. Bagi para kalian yang suka surfing disediaka. Perahu untuk ketengah laut dan disediakan coach nya. Terdapat restoran jepang dilantai 2 (LOBBY HOTEL), apa bila anda ingin chack out kalian tinggal telepon resepsionis dan tidak usah berjalan karena disediakan kendaraan untuk menjemput anda. Menurut saya resort ini luar biasa sebab semuanya ada di situ dari travel hingga hiburan dan masih banyak yang lainnya apabila anda butuh telepon ke luar negara terdapat telepon khusus berletak di belakang lobby."

We went to nusa dua to visit the other 5 star hotels, and The Patra is definitely on par but at a much lower price point. Loved our stay!!"

"367.","Daphne Voon","5","2016-12-30","3","Near the airport, can walk there in 10 minutes! Nice beach with strong waves. Nice swimming pools and ground. There are mosquitoes in the room but I guess this is common in Bali. Can hear conversations from next room and foot steps or furniture movement sound from upstairs. Quite a distance to get to Kuta Central (30 minutes walk) or to nearby eateries (15 - 20 minutes walk). However, there are a few scheduled free shuttle services to Kuta Central and I found short cut through small roads later."

"376.","Luzviminda Bayani","44","2018-12-30","2","The good reviews of this hotel may have come from those who stayed at this hotel's suites or penthouses. But we stayed at a Deluxe, so my experience tells quite a different story. HOTEL: Albeit showing signs of age, the hotel's lobby and outside structure looked like it was grand during its heyday. Being in front of the beach makes this hotel a good spot to watch the sunset. The compound is so huge that it takes a few minutes of walk from the far-end villas to the lobby. FACILITIES: This is where this hotel terribly fails. The room stinks! Perhaps because the exhaust is not working properly, or at all. The room we stayed at had a malfunctioning aircon that turned off every 1 hour. I called up the front desk 3 times but they were not able to figure out what was wrong with the aircon, so I spent my first night unable to sleep well because it was hot! They were able to repair the aircon the next day. Add to that that the beddings stink...I had to cover the pillow with a towel because it was old and dirty and just smelly. The worst part was the unstable wi-fi signal which you literally had to find and catch. It's like finding certain square inches in the room where you get the signal, but as soon as you move your phone, you lose it! Then you go to the pool area where you can supposedly watch the sunset, but you are distracted by the guys working right in front of the pool area. I took a shower near the pool before taking a dip, and was astounded by this layer of moss/algae on the shower head. This is not due to age, but just a simple mismanagement of the housekeeping people. A number of tiles on the pool is also damaged, with some very slimy fom the moss, I think. STAFF: Not mean, but not nice either. It's like they just go there to do their jobs, nothing more. No typical friendly Asian smiles or the usual hotel courtesies. LOCATION: You are basically imprisoned inside the hotel. You need a taxi to get out, because the lobby is just too far from the road and the taxis overcharge you if they come to pick you up. BREAKFAST: This was the only great thing about this hotel. The food was varied and delicious. The offerings are more than the usual. All in all, I do not recommend this place. Bali has hundreds of other hotels which surely are better than this."

"379.","NP Cindy","27","2019-12-30","3","Held my wedding here on Tambiling pool. View was awesome, the staff were attentive. Breakfast was alright. The reason for 3 stars was because on the wedding day, the AC was broken. Unfortunately the make up need to be done in my room which kind of warm & steamy at that time.. everyone was gasping for air. The hotel staff brought portable AC that help a little bit. Another reason for the 3 stars was unsatisfactory experience at the spa. For the price we paid for frangipani couple treatment, we felt like we got the inexperience therapist. the massage pressure was compensating the technique."

The first room we were in w as quite awful with tiles falling off in thr bathroom, counter being chipped and dirty sheets. We complained and we're promptly upgraded to a beautiful, large suite which was fantastic, but the overall facilities were not up to par in my opinion for a 5 star resort."

If you are stay in deluxe or deluxe suite, Your room will be located on FAR BACK side of hotel, Which means you have to walk thought Some creepy local dayworkers who starring at you while they taking a smoking break, and which is BAD. Room itself was SERIOUSLY OUTDATED, It needs to be renovated. Lights in front of room was blink all the time, which makes me think that hotel dosen't really care about facilities."

Poor receptionist service. the lady in front desk just soooo arrogant and soooo unhelpful just because I am not bule (they treat foreigners better btw). Breakfast is so-so. I had my potato wedges and tempe bacem so sour. Room is no better. Very dusty, smell bad and haunted. Some strange sounds often heared, and at one time the door below closet was opened by itself. I cant make myself alone in the room throughout the nights so I asked my friends to accompany me. The only good thing from this hotel is its beach scenery where we can see planes landing in nearby airport runway. A view for aviation geeks. But that's it. Wont come back even if it was free."
"415.","Leon E","25","2017-12-30","5","The staff at the Patra is absolutely amazing. Although we've experienced some very friendly staff in other hotels, the people who work at Patra (regardless of their job title) make sure you feel like a royalty. Breakfast here has everything you could wish for; ranging from western/European breakfast to nasi goreng. Dinner is good but not inexpensive (although in all fairness that comes with the territory of staying at a luxury resort). The hotel room and bathroom itself could be described as immaculate, just like the rest of the resort. The Patra resort is located near the airport. This does mean you'll hear airplanes take off and land. However, due to the beautiful and clean swimming pools and overall atmosphere you'll forget there even *is* an airport around the corner. If you stay at Patra I would strongly recommend booking a massage. The salon staff is very friendly and professional, and even though the 120min is longer than any massage you'll most likely have in your life you'll wish it would take even longer. That's how good the treatments are. The only downside of the Patra would be the sound isolation in between two hotel rooms. We could literally hear every word our of our neighbors' conversations. Especially when you or other guests have small children /babies this can be an issue because of the noise. It's caused by two hotel rooms being separated by two doors. I'm certain the luxury villas don't have this issue though. Everything is at a walking distance. Except you might want to take a taxi when the sun's out in between 12pm - 3am considering the heat. Helping you get a taxi is something the service desk staff is more than happy to help you with. Overall the Patra resort is a place where you're pampered due to its incredible staff and luxurious appearance."

"423.","Taufik Mahlan","79","2019-12-30","4","Big old good cottage hotel. The cottages are suites. Problem: far from shops and malls. Walking on the beach for 15 minutes can take you to beach cafes and restaurants. The place is right next to Denpasar airport, but you won't hear the roar of the Jets from your cottage. Nice place to seclude yourself from your daily life. The place is vast, winding and branching walkways from lobby to your cottage with small signs along the way. Guaranteed you will be lost the first time you try to get to your cottage or to the lobby. But you can ask to be carried by a golf cart if you are fed up of getting lost. Call 1."

No one ever showed so I hauled all the stuff to the front desk myself. Thought maybe they were back up but both golf carts were still there. Also the tour guide they gave us named Ditka scammed us out of money at the bridge saying he didn't have money for the toll. We assumed we'd be reimbursed or have a reduced fee for the money we gave him. And he still didn't have money to reimburse. Poor experience at the spa as well. Rooms are very outdated & they only have one key (which sucks if you're in a group)."

So currently we are still crammed into one villa (there is 8 of us) and are extremely disappointed with the service. If I ever return to Bali I will completely avoid this place. They have fixed the issue, I appreciate how quickly they were able to do this, but still disappointed that it had to happen in the first place."

Setelah drama menunggu 1jam 10 menit kita dapat kamar dan kecewa lagi ketika ke kamar tidak ada buggi yg mengantar,kita jalan ke kamar yg lumayan jauh dari lobi,kalo saya pribadi gak masalah tp kita berlima+1 bayi umur 1,5thn . Setelah sampai kamar kunci nya pun tidak bisa utk membuka kamar. Untung ada petugas yg membukakan. Kamar mandi shower gabisa nyala,wc ga bisa si splash. Shampo cuma dapet satu pdhl kita berlima. kalah bgt sama hotel2 bintang 2,3,4. Entah karena ramai atau perlakuan berbeda karena kami turis lokal bukan bule. Sangat berbeda jauh dengan hotel2 bintang 5 di nusa dua yg mereka tdk membeda2 kan turis lokal maupun mancanegara pdhl saya dapet Harga tidak jauh berbeda. Cukup sekali kesini kapok 😂"

"612.","Rajesh Chauhan","85","2026-01-07","1","Penginapan kami di Kamar 505 di The Patra Bali Resort & Villas ternyata merupakan pengalaman yang sangat mengecewakan, sangat tidak sesuai dengan citra mewah yang diproyeksikan oleh merek tersebut. Meskipun properti ini terlihat mengesankan secara visual di permukaan, pengalaman di dalam kamar dan pelaksanaan layanan menunjukkan kekurangan operasional yang serius. Kesan Awal – Kemewahan yang Menyesatkan Saat check-in, semuanya tampak rapi dan premium, menciptakan kesan pertama yang kuat. Namun, persepsi ini memburuk dengan cepat begitu kami benar-benar mulai menggunakan layanan yang terkait dengan kamar kami. Kunjungan Spa – Pereda Nyeri Sementara, Bukan Penyelamatan Kami memilih pijat spa karena kelelahan perjalanan. Meskipun pijatannya sendiri dapat diterima, itu menonjol sebagai salah satu dari sedikit hal positif selama menginap dan tidak banyak membantu mengimbangi pengalaman keseluruhan di Kamar 505. Lokasi Kamar & Masalah Aksesibilitas Kamar 505 terletak terlalu jauh dari lobi, sehingga pergerakan menjadi sangat tidak nyaman. Layanan buggy diperlukan hanya untuk mencapai kamar, yang segera menimbulkan kekhawatiran tentang aksesibilitas—terutama di malam hari atau selama masalah layanan. Keluhan Kebisingan yang Tidak Profesional Sekitar pukul 21.00, saat kami sedang melakukan panggilan telepon keluarga biasa dan tertawa santai, telepon kamar berdering. Resepsionis dengan blak-blakan mengeluhkan terlalu banyak kebisingan dari kamar kami, menyatakan bahwa tetangga tidak bisa tidur. Nada dan waktu panggilan ini terasa mengganggu, ditangani dengan buruk, dan tidak proporsional, sama sekali mengabaikan realitas perilaku tamu normal di lingkungan resor. Interaksi ini terasa lebih seperti pengawasan daripada keramahan. Biaya Berlebihan & Tidak Wajar Pada pukul 22.30, kami meminta air minum tambahan melalui layanan kamar dan diberitahu bahwa itu dikenakan biaya. Kami ditagih IDR 142.000 hanya untuk dua botol air—biaya yang tidak masuk akal untuk resor yang mengklaim standar mewah. Ini mencerminkan persepsi nilai yang buruk dan kurangnya pemikiran yang mengutamakan tamu. Kerusakan Kartu Kunci – Gangguan Layanan Utama Malam berikutnya, setelah kembali sekitar pukul 19.00 dari hari yang melelahkan di luar, kunci kamar kami untuk Kamar 505 berhenti berfungsi. Tidak ada bantuan di dekatnya, memaksa kami berjalan kaki kembali ke lobi bersama istri saya—situasi yang tidak dapat diterima mengingat jaraknya. Meskipun masalah tersebut akhirnya diperbaiki, ketidaknyamanan, kelelahan, dan kurangnya dukungan proaktif menjadikan ini kegagalan layanan yang besar. Insiden Piring Makan – Birokrasi Mengalahkan Keramahtamahan Kami memesan makan malam dari Grab dan hanya meminta dua piring untuk makan di kamar kami. Yang mengejutkan, hotel tersebut: • Membebankan biaya Rp 30.000 untuk piring • Meminta kami menandatangani dokumen untuk meminjamnya Ini terasa sepele, transaksional, dan benar-benar tidak masuk akal untuk resor kategori ini. Prosesnya lebih mengingatkan pada catatan inventaris hostel daripada pengalaman resor bintang lima. Kesimpulan Akhir – Kamar 505 Harus Dihindari Kamar 505 mewakili semua yang salah selama masa inap kami—aksesibilitas yang buruk, kebijakan yang kaku, biaya yang berlebihan, kurangnya empati, dan inefisiensi operasional. Meskipun resor ini memasarkan dirinya sebagai tempat mewah, kenyataannya adalah resor ini berorientasi pada kebijakan, tidak ramah terhadap tamu, dan secara operasional terputus dari standar keramahan yang sebenarnya. Kesimpulan: Terlepas dari eksterior dan branding yang menarik, The Patra Bali Resort & Villas gagal memberikan tingkat kenyamanan dan keramahan dasar selama kami menginap di Kamar 505. Ini bukanlah pengalaman mewah—melainkan mengecewakan, terlalu mahal, dan melelahkan. Kami tidak akan merekomendasikan menginap di kamar ini, dan kami akan berpikir dua kali sebelum memilih properti ini lagi."
"613.","Danielle Dufall","77","2025-11-14","1","Kami memilih menginap di The Patra Resort & Villas karena lingkungannya yang indah. Saya sudah sering menginap di sini, dan setelah baru saja punya bayi, saya pikir ini tempat yang sempurna untuk bersantai. Sayangnya, kenangan itu telah hancur total. Resor ini jelas-jelas telah merosot drastis. Resor yang dulunya merupakan resor bintang 5 kini terasa terbengkalai dan kumuh. Sungguh memalukan dikenakan harga penuh untuk resor yang diiklankan sebagai resor mewah, padahal standarnya hampir tidak memenuhi standar bintang 3. Handuknya bahkan lebih buruk daripada handuk di motel kelas bawah — tipis, usang, dan jelas sudah melewati tanggal kedaluwarsa. Rasanya seperti tidak ada yang diperbarui selama lebih dari 15 tahun. Di bar kolam renang, kami diberitahu bahwa kami tidak bisa menagihkan minuman ke kamar. Saya sudah check-in, menunjukkan tiga paspor, dan menyimpan kartu kredit saya, tetapi entah bagaimana kenyamanan dasar ini tidak tersedia. Belum pernah seumur hidup saya mengalami kebijakan konyol seperti itu di resor yang katanya berbintang 5. Alih-alih bersantai, saya malah harus berjalan kembali ke kamar, basah kuyup, untuk mengambil kartu saya karena tidak ada seorang pun di bagian check-in yang repot-repot menjelaskan kebijakan ini. Benar-benar tidak dapat diterima dan memalukan. Lalu tibalah titik puncaknya. Pada malam kedua kami, sekitar pukul 21.30, telepon kamar berdering keras — membangunkan suami dan bayi kami yang berusia 7 bulan. Ternyata telepon dari pihak hotel sedang membahas masalah transaksi. Kami bilang akan memeriksanya, tetapi mereka menelepon dua kali lagi, membangunkan bayi kami setiap kali. Suaranya memekakkan telinga, dan kurangnya pertimbangan itu sangat menyebalkan. Ketika suami saya menjelaskan bahwa mereka telah membangunkan anak kami, mereka tertawa seolah-olah itu lelucon. Saya mengirim email ke pihak hotel mengenai hal ini dan mereka bahkan tidak punya sopan santun untuk membalas. Saya memberi mereka kesempatan untuk membalas dan tidak ada tanggapan. Sejujurnya saya sangat kecewa dengan pengalaman menginap kami. Dua malam pertama terasa menegangkan dan melelahkan, alih-alih damai. Saya berharap kami bisa membatalkan sisa masa inap kami. Parahnya lagi, teman-teman kami akan segera bergabung, dan saya malu merekomendasikan resor ini. Seharusnya tidak ada yang menghabiskan liburan mereka dengan marah dan menghitung hari sampai mereka bisa pergi. Saya tidak merekomendasikan Patra Villas and Resort dan sayangnya kami tidak akan kembali. Saya sudah memberikan banyak ulasan di Google dan semuanya selalu jujur. Kalau saja saya bisa memberi 0 bintang, saya pasti akan melakukannya."
"614.","My Tran","1","2026-01-07","1","Saya mengalami pengalaman yang sangat buruk. Saya tiba cukup larut untuk check-in pukul 21.00. Kemudian saya bertemu dengan resepsionis yang sikapnya sangat buruk; dia tidak menjelaskan apa pun, hanya memberi saya kunci kamar. Kamar terletak sangat jauh dan membutuhkan transportasi. Keluarga saya memiliki dua anak kecil dan banyak barang bawaan. Saya harus proaktif bertanya bagaimana cara menuju kamar, dan mereka menyuruh saya menunggu dan mobil akan menjemput kami. Setelah diantar ke kamar, tidak ada petunjuk tentang cara menggunakan kamar, tidak seperti hotel lain. Saya merasa seperti bukan tamu yang membayar, melainkan seseorang yang menginap gratis. Saya merasa tidak sepadan membayar hotel bintang lima untuk menerima layanan yang buruk seperti itu. Saya tidak akan merekomendasikan hotel ini. Saya berada di Bali selama empat hari dan menginap di tiga hotel berbeda. Ini adalah hotel terburuk yang pernah saya tinggali."
"615.","BrandtFamily","1","2026-01-07","1","Bukan hotel bintang 5, lebih tepatnya hotel bintang 3 biasa saja, sangat usang, di sebelah pantai tempat penduduk setempat membakar sampah. Handuk compang-camping, pintu kamar mandi tidak bisa ditutup, staf tidak peduli, dan kami harus menaiki tangga batu yang sangat curam untuk sampai ke kamar kami, tidak ada lift yang tersedia. Saat tiba, kami dipaksa memasukkan kartu kredit kami ke mesin pembayaran yang terus disingkirkan resepsionis dari pandangan kami, dan PIN-nya tidak berfungsi, padahal sebelumnya tidak pernah gagal. PIN kami adalah angka yang logis dan tidak pernah salah. Transaksi palsu mulai muncul tak lama kemudian, dan hotel ini adalah tempat terakhir kami menggunakan kartu kredit tersebut, jadi kami terpaksa membatalkan kartu kredit kami di awal perjalanan keliling dunia. Saya tidak akan pernah menginap di sini lagi, dan tidak akan merekomendasikan hotel ini."

Kamar-kamarnya berbentuk seperti rumah-rumah kecil (4 kamar per gedung), tersebar, tanpa pemandangan. Benar-benar seperti perumahan besar yang tak bernyawa. Anda harus berjalan kaki 15 menit di bawah sinar matahari penuh untuk sampai ke area sarapan - kolam renang... Kolam renangnya terlihat bagus, tetapi dengan hanya 3 kursi santai yang saling berhadapan dan sudah terisi pada pukul 10 pagi, kami tidak benar-benar menikmatinya..😂 Sarapan: sungguh mimpi buruk, selain telur dan 3 potong buah, tidak ada apa-apa. Pukul 09.30, hampir seluruh prasmanan kosong, sebagian besar hidangan yang ditawarkan hambar... prasmanan yang sungguh hambar. Kamarnya bersih tetapi perlu penyegaran, meskipun seprai berkualitas baik. Jika Anda bersikeras menginap di sini, pilihlah kamar di lantai atas.. Lokasi hotelnya tidak terlalu bagus, tetapi pantainya bisa dicapai dengan berjalan kaki. Bagi saya, hotel ini sama sekali tidak menarik, kecuali untuk persinggahan satu malam agar dekat dengan bandara. Saya sama sekali tidak merekomendasikannya. Kami membayar €150 untuk dua malam melalui Agoda. Mengingat standar Airbnb dan hotel lain yang kami inapi di Bali, ini sungguh bukan penawaran yang bagus... Paling banter, ini hotel bintang 1 hingga 2."

Tidak layak untuk tinggal di kamar ini bersama anak-anak dan orang tua. Ketika saya mencoba membatalkan pemesanan, mereka melakukan segala cara untuk menghindarinya, terus-menerus membuat alasan dan sengaja mempersulit saya. Mereka bahkan mencoba mencegah saya menjawab telepon ketika saya menelepon untuk meminta bantuan. Saya menghabiskan lima jam berdebat dengan mereka, yang menyebabkan saya kehilangan banyak rencana lain dan memaksa saya untuk mencari hotel lain di tengah malam. Terlepas dari semua itu, saya tetap bersikeras untuk membatalkan. Tempat ini benar-benar menindas pelanggannya."

"619.","Lauren Pierik","1","2025-11-14","1","Saya memiliki pengalaman yang sangat buruk dengan resor ini. Saya melakukan pembayaran melalui transfer bank sesuai petunjuk, tetapi baru keesokan harinya—setelah uang terkirim—mereka memberi tahu saya bahwa bank-bank di Indonesia tidak dapat diandalkan dan mungkin butuh waktu lama untuk menerima dana tersebut. Karena itu, saya terpaksa membayar lagi dengan kartu kredit untuk mengamankan pemesanan saya. Beberapa bulan kemudian, uang hasil transfer bank tersebut resmi didebet dari rekening saya, tetapi pihak resor terus mengklaim bahwa mereka tidak pernah menerimanya. Ketika saya menghubungi mereka, mereka menolak untuk memberikan pengembalian dana. Bahkan, melalui telepon, mereka benar-benar mengatakan bahwa uang saya hilang dan saya tidak akan pernah mendapatkannya kembali. Ini sangat mengecewakan. Jika mereka memberi tahu saya sebelum transaksi—bukan setelahnya—saya tidak akan pernah melakukan transfer bank sejak awal. Saya merasa ditipu dan diperlakukan tidak adil, dan saya sangat menyarankan orang lain untuk tidak melakukan pembayaran ke resor ini melalui transfer bank."

Kami memanggil staf untuk membantu memperbaiki pancuran dan diberi tahu bahwa itu rusak, cukup lepaskan dari pengait dan gunakan cara itu untuk mandi. Rak handuk lepas dari dinding dan retakan di seluruh kamar. Area/kebun, meskipun bagus (tertumbuhi tanaman liar), sama sekali tidak terawat, dan jalan-jalannya tampak rusak, dengan lubang besar dan perawatan yang setengah jadi. Jumlah staf tidak cukup untuk melayani tiga kolam renang yang mereka miliki (kolam renang utama indah) dan harganya tinggi untuk kualitas makanan yang Anda dapatkan.

Mereka juga menyediakan nasi goreng telur, jadi saya meminta mereka untuk membuatnya tanpa telur, tetapi mereka menolak dan mengatakan bahwa itu adalah standar mereka. Kemudian saya meminta susu dan lagi-lagi dengan sangat tidak sopan mereka menolak. Di kamar tidak ada losion, jadi saya memintanya dan saya mengatakan bahwa ini adalah barang yang sangat penting dan mereka tidak memilikinya, jadi mereka mengatakan kepada saya untuk melakukan apa pun yang saya mau, itu adalah standar mereka. Mereka tidak mau membantu Anda dalam kesulitan apa pun dan perilakunya sangat tidak sopan."

"629.","Joe","65","2025-07-14","1","“Perjalanan tak selalu indah. Tak selalu nyaman. Terkadang menyakitkan, bahkan patah hati. Tapi tak apa. Perjalanan mengubahmu; seharusnya mengubahmu.” – Anthony Bourdain Patra di Kuta, Bali, telah menjadi sosok yang berulang dalam kisah keluarga kami selama lebih dari 15 tahun—sebuah tempat favorit di mana matahari terbenam mewarnai langit dengan warna-warna berapi-api dan lautan berbisik menjanjikan pelarian. Namun pada kunjungan terakhir kami, skenarionya terbalik. Pelukan yang dulunya akrab kini terasa seperti jabat tangan lelah dari seorang sahabat lama yang telah melepaskan diri. Patra, tampaknya, telah kehilangan jiwanya, dan saya tak yakin ia akan kembali. Mari kita mulai dengan momen-momen terburuk, momen yang membuat darah membeku dengan cara yang tak dapat dicairkan oleh panas tropis. Anak-anak kami—usia 6 dan 9 tahun, penuh dengan kegembiraan yang tak terkira yang hanya dapat disulut oleh kolam renang hotel—sedang bermain bola, tertawa, menjalani kehidupan terbaik mereka di Bali. Masuklah sekelompok orang dewasa, yang, dengan sikap sangat tidak dewasa, menuntut anak-anak itu menyerahkan bola atau akan dipukuli. Ya, Anda tidak salah baca. Pria dewasa mengancam anak-anak hanya karena mainan kolam renang. Di kota Barat, ini akan menjadi laporan polisi lebih cepat daripada Anda bisa mengatakan membahayakan anak. Kami langsung menuju pihak manajemen, jantung berdebar kencang, mengharapkan tindakan cepat. Namun, kami hanya mendapat angkat bahu. Keheningan. Para pelaku terus saja melanjutkan aksinya, tanpa peduli, sementara kompas moral hotel berputar seperti baling-baling cuaca yang rusak. Anda tidak pantas menyebut diri Anda resor ramah keluarga jika Anda membiarkan hal ini berlalu begitu saja, Patra. Keamanan bukan sekadar kata kunci; itu adalah janji, dan Anda mengingkarinya. Kamarnya—oh, kamarnya. Kami merogoh kocek untuk salah satu kamar yang lebih mahal, mengharapkan sentuhan kemewahan, atau setidaknya perawatan dasar. Yang kami dapatkan adalah museum kelalaian. Setiap gagang pintu berderit seperti properti rumah hantu, setiap pintu berderit protes saat dibuka, seolah-olah meminta WD-40. Lampu berkedip-kedip atau bahkan mati total, membuat ruangan suram yang terasa lebih seperti gua daripada tempat peristirahatan tropis. Noda di gorden berbisik tentang hari-hari yang lebih baik, dan kamar mandinya? Binatang temperamental yang tak bisa memutuskan apakah ingin membuat kami melepuh atau membeku. Seolah-olah petugas pemeliharaan memeriksa bertahun-tahun yang lalu dan meninggalkan catatan tempel bertuliskan, Semoga berhasil. Properti itu sendiri adalah peninggalan yang runtuh. Batu bata hilang dari jalan setapak, berserakan seperti reruntuhan peradaban kuno yang lupa cara merawatnya. Dek gazebo adalah ladang ranjau kayu lepas dan paku yang menonjol—untungnya, suntikan tetanus kami sudah diperbarui, kalau tidak, kami pasti sedang bermain permainan berbahaya tebak infeksinya. Ini bukan sekadar kelalaian; ini bahaya, sesederhana itu. Patra seakan berjalan dalam tidurnya sendiri, merangkai ide-ide setengah matang untuk meraih kembali kejayaannya. Spoiler: tidak berhasil. Lalu ada hiburan malam, atau apa pun sebutannya. Seorang DJ live di tepi kolam renang utama, memainkan lagu-lagu yang dibumbui kata-kata kasar dan ode untuk penari telanjang, sementara anak-anak—anak-anak—masih bermain air di dekatnya. Begini, saya bukan orang sok suci, tapi ada waktu dan tempat untuk lagu-lagu dewasa, dan kolam renang ramah keluarga pukul 19.00 bukan pilihan yang tepat. Patra seakan mengalami krisis identitas, ragu apakah ingin menjadi klub malam hedonistik atau resor ramah anak. Pilihlah jalan, kawan. Tapi tidak semuanya suram. Namun, bahkan keajaiban Bali pun tak mampu menebus tempat yang mengabaikan hal-hal mendasar bagi para tamunya. Keamanan, misalnya, hanyalah sandiwara belaka. Para penjaga memeriksa mobil dengan kaca spion, tetapi nyaris tak melirik ke bawah, melakukan sandiwara keamanan yang terasa hampa seperti respons hotel terhadap keluhan kami. Hotel yang tidak menganggap serius kekerasan tidak pantas dipercaya. Kenyataan itu begitu menyayat hati, membekas seperti sisa rasa makanan yang buruk. Apakah saya akan kembali? Mungkin tidak. Patra terasa seperti tempat yang pasrah, bermandikan air mata di lokasi primanya sementara retakan—baik harfiah maupun kiasan—semakin lebar. Bagi kami, harapannya condong ke arah tidak akan pernah lagi."

Spa beroperasi di satu ruangan. Biaya tersembunyi untuk semuanya. Hanya terlihat bagus di foto.

Kami berjalan kaki setiap hari dari kamar ke kolam renang, dari kolam renang ke kamar, dan juga setelah menyelesaikan aktivitas seharian di Bali, ketika kami kembali ke resor, taksi tidak ada untuk mengantar kami ke kamar. Perbaiki menu sarapan Anda dan MOHON SEBUTKAN label VEGETARIAN dan NON-VEGETARIAN. Karena saya dan pasangan adalah vegetarian murni dan kami makan kopi dan pasta setiap hari untuk sarapan, tidak ada pilihan lain yang tersedia di resor. Beberapa makanan vegetarian terlalu berminyak. Itulah mengapa saya menderita batuk. Perbaiki fasilitas Wifi Anda. Bahkan pengering rambut tidak ada di kamar mandi tetapi di rak kamar. Setidaknya sebutkan label pengering rambut di rak tersebut. Tidak ada cukup botol air untuk kami dan jika kami ingin botol air tambahan, harganya akan sangat mahal. Lain kali kami tidak akan datang ke sini dan kami tidak akan merekomendasikan resor ini kepada teman dan keluarga kami. Rekomendasi: tambahkan beberapa makanan India Selatan dalam sarapan Anda agar orang India vegetarian memiliki pilihan makanan. Staf keamanan dan staf restoran sangat ramah dan rendah hati. Suasana resor sangat menakjubkan, cuaca berawan dan hujan, kolam renang juga sangat bagus dan pemandangan matahari terbenam yang menakjubkan."

Staf restoran kurang perhatian, lambat, dan tampak sama sekali tidak tertarik untuk memberikan layanan yang baik. Pesanan membutuhkan waktu yang sangat lama untuk sampai, dan itupun seringkali salah. Ketika saya dengan sopan menyampaikan hal ini kepada mereka, saya justru ditanggapi dengan sikap acuh tak acuh dan sama sekali tidak meminta maaf. Lebih parah lagi, layanan kamarnya sangat buruk. Saya memesan makanan sederhana, tetapi butuh waktu lebih dari satu setengah jam untuk sampai. Ketika saya menelepon untuk menanyakan tentang penundaan tersebut, saya diberi tahu bahwa mereka sibuk dan akan membutuhkan beberapa menit lagi. Tingkat layanan ini tidak dapat diterima, terutama untuk resor yang mengklaim memberikan keramahan tingkat tinggi. Secara keseluruhan, pengalaman saya di Patrabali Resort sangat mengecewakan. Stafnya tampak kurang terlatih, dan layanannya selalu lambat dan tidak ramah. Kecuali resor mengambil langkah serius untuk mengatasi masalah ini, saya tidak akan merekomendasikan menginap di sini."

Apakah mereka hanya melakukan setengah renovasi? Hindari jika Anda mengharapkan kenyamanan di beberapa malam terakhir Anda di Bali. Kami memesan hotel ini malam sebelum terbang pulang & setelah hotel yang terjangkau namun mewah dan nyaman, kami disambut dengan kekecewaan yang luar biasa. Pintu masuknya megah dan luar biasa, yang menyebabkan rasa aman yang salah pada awalnya. Resepsionisnya autopilot dan merupakan pengalaman resepsionis yang paling tidak ramah dari semua pengalaman resepsionis yang pernah kami alami. Dia memberi tahu kami bahwa kamar kami adalah peningkatan tetapi terasa seperti penurunan yang sangat besar! Mengikuti pelayan ke labirin vila dan dengan cepat menjadi jelas bahwa ini bukanlah kemewahan yang kami harapkan. Dindingnya tidak rata, piring tamu kotor dengan makanan yang tersisa & tidak dibersihkan dan tetap seperti itu bahkan satu jam kemudian ketika kami berjalan melewatinya lagi. Demi satu malam, kami tidak mengeluh tetapi berharap kami mengeluh. Kami hanya menggunakan hotel ini sebagai tempat tidur sebelum penerbangan, tetapi ketika hendak tidur, kami bahkan merasa khawatir apakah tempat tidurnya sendiri akan cukup bersih karena rangka tempat tidur berdebu dan kotor. AC-nya sangat keras sehingga meredam semua kebisingan dari luar setelah dimatikan. Kami pikir kami akan memilih malam yang hangat sebagai ganti ketenangan, tetapi yang terjadi malah suara bising dari luar. Tidak tahan berada di kamar mandi lebih lama dari yang seharusnya. Saya tidak akan kecewa dan khawatir dengan semua yang disebutkan seandainya saya benar-benar memilih hotel bintang 2 atau bahkan 3."

Vila ini luas dengan lemari pakaian walk-in dan secara keseluruhan cukup bersih, tempat tidurnya nyaman dan seprainya sangat bersih. Restoran Italia di dalamnya cukup bagus, dan acara barbekyu malam dengan pertunjukan jauh lebih baik dibandingkan dengan resor lain. Sarapannya enak dan bervariasi, tetapi antrean untuk mendapatkan telur orak-arik tidak ada habisnya. Ada tiga kolam renang besar dan sangat bagus. Peringkat bintang 5 diberikan untuk staf yang selalu berusaha mengakomodasi setiap permintaan, dan petugas keamanan membuat Anda merasa benar-benar aman, melihat mereka di mana-mana. Meskipun saya berusaha sebaik mungkin untuk melihat yang terbaik dari properti ini, saya tetap menyadari bahwa properti ini sudah rusak dan tidak sepadan dengan harga untuk menginap semalam! Satu-satunya hal yang indah dan terawat dari resor ini adalah pintu masuk, area check-in, dan ruang hijau, di mana staf berusaha sebaik mungkin untuk menjaganya tetap rapi. KELEMAHAN Kolam renang kecil dan sumur yang terletak di koridor luar menuju teras kecil sungguh menjijikkan, paling tidak. Bisa bikin mual selama sebulan. Saya tak bisa menggambarkan betapa kecewanya saya melihat begitu banyak kotoran untuk vila BULAN MADU!!! Jika vila itu benar-benar menjadi tempat persinggahan saya selama bulan madu, siapa pun yang mengelola tempat itu tanpa peduli akan menyesali lokasinya di dalam resor! Perabotan di kamar akan hancur jika Anda membuka pintu lemari atau laci; vila-vila ini perlu renovasi besar-besaran! Jendela di kamar yang bersebelahan dengan kolam renang dalam kondisi buruk karena sering terkena cipratan air; lebih baik jangan naikkan gordennya, nanti bisa bikin mual! Timbangan di pintu masuk (karena tidak memungkinkan untuk memilikinya di kamar) terlalu berat 2,5 kg, dan saya harus membuka koper tepat di pintu masuk untuk menyeimbangkannya, hanya untuk tiba di check-in bandara dan menyadari beratnya benar!!! Butuh 5 menit untuk bosan karena ruang di tas jinjing telah disediakan untuk suvenir. Resor bintang 5 tanpa pembuat kopi, tetapi hanya ada ketel dan dua sachet kopi Nespresso. Saya akan berhenti di sini untuk hal-hal negatifnya karena saya sudah cukup membuang waktu di tempat yang mengecewakan ini! PS: Beruntunglah Anda, karena saya tidak bisa menambahkan video."

Saya tidak merekomendasikan Anda memesan hotel ini jika Anda membawa anak kecil. Mereka bilang di situs web mereka menawarkan pantai pribadi, tetapi tamu tidak bisa benar-benar menikmatinya karena penuh sampah di pasir. Seharusnya ada 3 restoran di hotel, tapi satu tutup, dan resepsionis merekomendasikan kami untuk pergi ke Discovery Mall untuk makan malam. Katanya karena mereka tidak punya koki di sana, apa pun yang kami pesan dari menu, mereka memesan dari restoran luar dan membawanya ke meja kami, yang akan memakan waktu lebih lama. Sungguh konyol!

Untuk rombongan berlima, yang kami dapatkan hanyalah dua botol air minum kemasan 'buatan sendiri' ukuran 300 ml. Lebih dari dua botol standar, mereka akan meminta pembayaran... dan ketika kami menjelaskan bahwa itu sudah termasuk dalam pemesanan, resepsionis akan meminta maaf tetapi tidak akan melakukan apa pun. Anda menelepon layanan kamar, dan mereka akan terus meminta pembayaran. Kisah ini berlanjut selama kami menginap, dan tidak ada yang tertarik untuk memahami atau meratifikasi situasi ini. Benar-benar menyedihkan!!! Mengapa mereka tidak bisa menjelaskan dengan jelas bahwa yang dimaksud dengan 'set air mineral gratis' hanyalah dua botol air minum kemasan standar, berapa pun jumlah rombongan Anda, dan setiap botol tambahan akan dikenakan biaya Rp20.000 untuk botol air minum biasa dan Rp50.000-60.000 untuk botol air mineral. Selama perjalanan kami di Bali, kami menginap di berbagai akomodasi, termasuk vila mandiri, tetapi Patra Bali adalah yang paling rendah dalam daftar kami. Selain itu, kami harus menunggu bagasi tiba di kamar setelah proses check-in, dan bagasi tersebut tidak akan diantar sampai setidaknya ada banyak panggilan telepon lanjutan. Lokasi dan staf restorannya luar biasa, tetapi manajemen hotel dan tim layanan kamar perlu meningkatkan layanan dan bersikap jujur ​​dalam melayani pelanggan. & ya, vila yang kami tempati adalah yang terbaik – The Royal Villa! Mengingat banyaknya hotel serupa di sekitar sini, kami tidak keberatan mencoba tempat lain lain kali. Kami memiliki ekspektasi yang tinggi terhadap hotel ini, tetapi setelah menginap dua malam, kami sama sekali tidak puas dan tidak akan merekomendasikan hotel ini kepada siapa pun.

Mereka menawarkan untuk mengganti kamar setelah kami membagikan foto-fotonya kepada agen kami, dan penawaran ini dibuat larut malam.

Lagipula, kami tidak punya jaminan kamar berikutnya akan bersih atau tidak karena properti ini sama sekali tidak terawat. Kami juga mendapati seekor kadal di kamar, yang sangat mengerikan. Selain itu, tidak ada sarapan India sama sekali, padahal banyak orang India yang menginap di sini. Properti ini sangat dekat dengan bandara, tetapi pasar terdekat hanya dapat diakses dengan taksi.

Saya menelepon resepsionis, mereka bilang tidak ada manajer yang bertugas, tetapi mereka meminta orang-orang untuk berhenti pukul 22.00, karena itu adalah jam malam, tetapi orang-orang itu mengabaikannya.

"648.","1 2","66","2025-01-14","1","Penginapan terburuk yang kami dapatkan di Bali, kami mendengarkan komentar yang mengatakan untuk memindahkan hotel ke suatu tempat dekat bandara yang merupakan ide buruk, itu bukan hotel bintang 5 yang sebenarnya, staf tidak ramah dan mereka memberi kami kamar berjamur, mereka tidak ingin mengubahnya, kami menghabiskan banyak waktu untuk memperjuangkan peningkatan yang lebih baik, mereka bahkan meminta uang tambahan untuk itu meskipun kamar baru masih berjamur tetapi lebih sedikit dari yang pertama, saya memastikan untuk menandai alergi saya sebelum menginap, saya tidak bisa tidur di malam hari karena semua alergi saya kambuh, mereka tidak peduli, juga penuh dengan debu dan kotoran dan serangga yang menjijikkan, mereka tidak pernah membersihkan. Ulasan di sini pasti palsu. Hotel yang terdaftar sebagai bintang 5 adalah sesuatu yang tidak saya mengerti. Gambar berbicara sendiri. Jauhi hotel ini dan jangan merusak masa tinggal Anda di Bali di sini."
"649.","Grazieli C. Jordão","3","2025-04-14","1","Area tepi pantai dipenuhi sampah. Jalan setapaknya tampak terbengkalai. Sayang sekali resor ini tidak peduli dengan area tersebut. Jika Anda senang berendam di kolam renang dan melihat banyak sampah, silakan dinikmati!"
"650.","Russell Tearle","15","2025-01-14","1","Tidak yakin bagaimana tempat ini bisa disebut bintang 5. Pelayanannya buruk sekali. Menu makanannya biasa saja. Jus buah segar berasal dari kemasan yang tidak dibuat segar. Satu-satunya hal yang bagus sejauh ini adalah lokasinya. Kamar-kamarnya tua. Seluruh tempat sepertinya perlu direnovasi. Ada tikus berkeliaran di luar. Sangat mahal dan tidak sepadan dengan harganya. Banyak hotel yang lebih baik di sebelahnya."
"651.","naomi ginn","5","2025-01-14","1","Resor ini adalah PENIPU TERBESAR. Mereka berbohong tentang lokasi, resor ini tepat di sebelah bandara. Kamar mandi saya berjamur, kamar ipar saya bau busuk. Perawatan resor ini sangat buruk setelah Anda keluar dari lobi / kolam renang utama. Resepsionis menelepon kamar saya 5 jam setelah memesan layanan kamar pukul 23.30 saat kami sedang tidur untuk mengambil piring kami, tetapi mereka tidak pernah mengambilnya. Mereka memaksa Anda untuk membayar minuman dan layanan kamar segera setelah Anda memesan karena tidak dapat dibebankan ke kamar kemudian memberi kami tagihan untuk semua barang yang sama yang sudah dibayar di akhir masa inap kami. Karena kami tidak berpikir untuk mendapatkan tanda terima, kami kembali dipaksa untuk membayar semuanya lagi. Resor ini BENAR-BENAR merusak pengalaman saya di Bali dan saya tidak akan pernah merekomendasikan siapa pun yang pernah saya temui untuk pergi ke sini."

Hotel ini memiliki pilihan makanan yang sangat terbatas untuk anak-anak dan mereka tidak menyediakan makanan untuk balita berdasarkan permintaan. Mereka juga tidak mengizinkan beberapa potong buah untuk dibawa pulang untuk balita! Layanannya sangat buruk. Hotel ini tidak ramah anak!!"
"653.","kinjal parekh","9","2025-01-14","1","Saya ragu ini resor bintang 5. Pelayanannya buruk. Makanannya mengerikan. Dan mereka menagih semua hal, bahkan untuk gelas tambahan.

"654.","Arjen Thonen","48","2024-01-14","1","Tempatnya jelek, ketinggalan jaman, dan tidak seperti yang terlihat di foto. Bagaimana mungkin ini hotel bintang 5?! Paling banter, 2 bintang. Semuanya tua, jelek, dan rusak. Ada konstruksi yang sedang berlangsung, tetapi tidak disebutkan saat pemesanan. Kolam renang tampak seperti tempat terbengkalai, rumputnya benar-benar kering dan cokelat, tempat tidurnya berkarat dan kotor, ada sampah dan rokok di lantai, dan yang lebih parah lagi, musiknya buruk sekali. Air mancur di depan kolam renang tampak seperti air selokan, airnya cokelat semua dan daun-daun kering berserakan di mana-mana, seperti di mana pemeliharaannya? Satu-satunya hal yang baik adalah lokasinya dekat dengan bandara, tetapi sungguh, jangan berharap pengalaman yang mendekati bintang 5."

Kami pikir kami akan memanjakan diri dengan sedikit kemewahan sebelum pulang, tetapi ternyata kami salah besar. Setiap hotel bintang 3 di Bali sepuluh kali lebih baik daripada hotel bintang 5 ini. Saya penasaran apakah manajemennya juga terdiri dari para trainee seperti kebanyakan staf. Dengan masalah yang ada ini, Anda hanya perlu menutup mata dan semuanya akan baik-baik saja. Namun, bagian terbaiknya adalah Anda harus membayar Rp150.000 untuk antar-jemput sejauh 200 meter ke bandara, sementara pengemudi Grap akan mengantar Anda setengah jalan mengelilingi pulau 😡 Maaf, tapi ini memang harus dikatakan!"
"657.","misk alrawi","2","2025-01-14","1","Pengalaman saya sangat buruk karena kurangnya keamanan. Saya dirampok $500 di hotel. Manajer hotel mengenali orang yang memasuki kamar saya pagi itu saat saya sedang sarapan.

Meskipun petugas tersebut mengakui memasuki kamar saya tanpa alasan, manajer tidak melakukan apa pun."

"659.","RWA Sector -10 DLF","5","2025-01-14","1","Ini adalah properti bintang 3 dan akan merusak pengalaman liburan Anda, jadi jangan menginap di sini. Staf dan manajer resepsionis sangat serakah dan hanya peduli dengan uang. Properti tua, air juga berbayar (hanya menyediakan 250ml gratis). AC-nya pun tidak memadai. Lebih baik membayar sedikit lebih mahal agar liburan Anda tidak rusak."
"660.","Chien Yu","11","2025-01-14","1","Jangan pernah meminta hotel untuk menyediakan mobil ke bandara. Hotel ini sangat dekat dengan bandara. Mereka mematok harga 15.000 rubel sebelum keberangkatan, tetapi begitu saya sampai di sana, mereka terus bilang tidak cukup. Akhirnya saya membayar 150.000 rubel sebelum pergi. Jangan pernah percaya pelayan bernama Dede di pintu! Jangan pernah meminta hotel untuk menyediakan mobil!"
"661.","Voorbeeld Office","5","2023-01-14","1","Lebih mirip kamar hostel daripada resor bintang lima. Kamar-kamarnya berbahaya untuk anak-anak, bak mandinya berkarat dan paku-pakunya mencuat.

"663.","AISHWARYA HANCHINAL","7","2025-01-14","1","Resornya lumayan. Hari kami check-out, kami menelepon layanan buggy, tapi mereka membuat kami menunggu sekitar 45 menit. Ketika kami datang untuk sarapan, mereka bilang sudah tutup. Kami meminta mereka untuk menyajikan setidaknya omelet roti atau selai roti, tetapi mereka menolak dengan alasan sarapan sudah tutup. Manajer makanan, ketika diberi tahu, hanya mengabaikan kami dengan baik dan bahkan tidak berusaha menyiapkannya untuk kami. Salah satu manajer dan staf terburuk yang pernah saya lihat. Beri mereka uang, mereka hanya tersenyum, dan saat check-out mereka memperlakukan kami dengan sangat buruk, sialan."
"664.","Gaurav Ghosh","20","2024-01-14","1","Kekecewaan mutlak. Saya akan sangat merekomendasikan siapa pun yang berencana ke Bali dan tinggal di Kuta, mohon Jangan buang pengalaman dan uang Anda di PATRA. Ini adalah perjalanan pertama saya ke Bali dan Patra adalah satu-satunya hal yang mengecewakan. Staf tidak ramah. Fasilitas sangat tidak terawat dan kotor. Kamar kami di dalamnya penuh dengan debu. Kami melihat kadal bergerak di dalam ruangan. Kami memesan 2 vila dan salah satu vila memiliki bau limbah. Mereka sarapan dengan banyak pilihan untuk sarapan tetapi terbang kemana-mana tanpa kebersihan. Bagian yang menjengkelkan adalah hotel sedang dalam renovasi sekarang dimulai pada hari kami check in tetapi tidak ada indikasi saat kami memesan. Sepanjang kami bisa mendengar suara konstruksi. Kolam renang kotor dan tidak terawat. Saya mendengar Patra dikenal karena pejabat pemerintah dan delegasinya tinggal dan mengadakan pertemuan. Ini adalah milik semi pemerintah. Staf bahkan tidak peduli dengan umpan balik yang Anda berikan. Saya membayar untuk tata graha, laundry dan makanan yang dipesan di kamar tetapi pada hari kami check out mereka meminta saya untuk membayar lagi dan mereka tidak menyimpan catatan pembayaran tagihan dan malah mulai bertanya apakah saya punya tanda terima. Saya tidak akan pernah tinggal di Patra bahkan sebagai menginap gratis."
"665.","Salwa yaseen","47","2024-01-14","1","Saya akan memberi nilai 0 jika bisa. Sangat kecewa. Saya tidak bisa menggambarkan betapa buruknya kamar kami, kami tidak bisa tidur di sana. Kamarnya sangat tua. Sayangnya lupa mengambil foto. Ada seekor kadal di tempat tidur dan tiga kadal di kamar mandi. Kami bahkan tidak merasa nyaman untuk menginap di sana, kami mencoba keluar hari itu, hanya memesan satu malam di sana karena kami ingin menginap dekat hotel. Satu-satunya hal baik tentang hotel ini adalah lokasinya. Sangat buruk mereka mengenakan biaya untuk adaptor?? Yang sangat aneh dan tidak pernah terjadi pada kami selama seluruh perjalanan kami ke Bali! Kami meninggalkan Bali dengan perasaan hancur karena hotel itu. Tidak masuk akal, ini hotel bintang 5. Saya butuh jawaban."
"666.","MONSONE SL","33","2025-01-14","1","Kualitasnya buruk, lautnya buruk, pesawat lewat setiap 5 menit, bau asapnya menyengat, satu-satunya hal yang menyenangkan adalah begitu keluar, Anda langsung terhanyut dalam kehidupan lokal. Hotel ini hanya hotel pendukung untuk tidur."

"668.","Reshma J","14","2023-01-14","1","Benar-benar buruk dan layanannya paling lambat. Saya menginap di 4 hotel di Indonesia dan Patra Bali adalah yang paling buruk. Resor dan suasananya bagus, dan itulah akhir ceritanya. Kamar-kamarnya tua dan usang. Kamar mandinya sangat buruk, airnya tidak mengalir dengan baik. Kamar-kamarnya tidak dibersihkan dengan benar karena banyak debu di lantai dan di dekat tempat tidur. Hanya ada satu colokan untuk mengisi daya ponsel/ponsel di seluruh kamar. Yang memperburuk pengalaman ini adalah layanan yang lambat dan banyaknya nyamuk. Bahkan di Ubud, saya tidak menemukan banyak nyamuk. Saya meminta pihak hotel untuk menyediakan obat nyamuk dan layanan kebersihan untuk memeriksa masalah saluran air. Saya harus menelepon mereka empat kali sebelum mereka mengirim seseorang untuk memeriksa."

"671.","Louis Nguyen","105","2024-01-14","1","Resor tua yang kurang terawat. Tanaman-tanamannya kurang terawat, handuk kamar mandinya tua dan bau. Bak mandinya sangat berkarat sehingga tidak bisa dijadikan shower, semua perlengkapannya berkarat, tempat tidur resor hanya dilengkapi 2 bantal tipis. Sarapannya sedikit, piringnya kering, dan kurang segar. Harganya tidak sepadan, sangat mengecewakan karena liburan yang buruk."
"672.","Arthur G.","12","2024-01-14","1","Di Eropa, itu maksimal satu bintang. Mereka tahu cara merusak suasana yang indah di sini, dengan musik keras yang mengganggu suasana. Makan malam pribadi digelar di tempat yang tak seorang pun masuk, memenuhi seluruh ruangan. Prasmanan yang ditawarkan di sini sungguh memalukan, hanya berisi tulang-tulang dan sudah terpanggang matahari selama lima jam. Selamat menikmati. Harga a la carte lima kali lipat harga sebenarnya di sini, dan kualitasnya lebih buruk daripada di restoran lain."
"673.","Louis Kretschmer","4","2023-01-14","1","Hotelnya sangat kuno. Kamar-kamarnya tua dan kurang terawat. Kompleks hotel ini tidak mencerminkan suasana Bali; terlalu artifisial dan sebagian besar tidak terawat.

"674.","Sara García Antón","25","2025-01-14","1","Kami tidak menginap di hotel, tapi kami pergi makan malam. Menu a la carte-nya di bawah standar untuk harga yang tinggi. Kami jelas tidak merekomendasikannya. Lagipula, penyajiannya lama sekali."
"675.","Nazli Terzioglu","11","2023-01-14","1","Ada 2 kecoak besar di kamar saya. Makanannya mengerikan. Tidak ada pilihan vegan atau vegetarian. Staf dan koki tidak tahu apa itu vegan atau vegetarian. Mereka menaruh telur goreng dan keju di atas makanan, bahkan ketika saya sudah bertanya berkali-kali. Stafnya ramah secara keseluruhan, tetapi wanita paruh baya di resepsionis tidak ramah. Dia memutar bola matanya ketika saya bercerita tentang kecoak itu."
"676.","FADIGA Wassa","15","2024-01-14","1","Saya beri satu bintang karena saya tidak bisa berbuat lebih sedikit. Hmm, jadi pertama-tama, dari mana saya harus mulai? Saya tidak tahu. Saya akan mencoba sesingkat mungkin. Pertama-tama, jika Anda mencari hotel Bali yang indah seukuran manusia, pergilah. Hotel ini seperti tumpukan barang-barang yang berantakan, dengan material yang buruk dan tidak terawat, dan perawatan kamarnya sangat buruk. Tergantung situs web tempat Anda memesan hotel ini, hotel ini bisa dianggap sebagai hotel bintang 4 atau bintang 5; kenyataannya, bukan. Hari kami tiba, sungguh seperti mimpi buruk: kamar-kamarnya kotor, gordennya robek seperti yang belum pernah saya lihat sebelumnya, cermin kamar mandinya retak, dan ada bercak-bercak lembap yang besar di gorden dan dinding, yang bahkan retak di beberapa tempat. Jejak debu di lantai parket membuat kamar 444 ini tampak seperti mimpi buruk atau lelucon yang buruk. Seprainya tidak nyaman dan keras, hanya berisi satu bantal per orang, pertama kalinya bagi kami yang terbiasa bepergian melintasi benua di hotel berkualitas, bahkan mungkin mewah. Oh, dan saya lupa, tidak ada kepala pancuran di kamar mandi, belum lagi keran tua dan MENJIJIKKAN yang tertutup karat dan jamur hijau. Setelah banyak protes, mereka akhirnya memutuskan untuk memindahkan kami ke kamar lain (8 jam setelah kedatangan kami). Resepsionis mencoba membuat kami percaya bahwa kamar ini sangat terpapar sinar matahari, yang menjelaskan betapa MEMBOSANKANnya kamar itu. Jadi saya bertanya apakah kelembapan juga membuat tirai terlihat kumal ini? Dia tidak dapat menemukan jawaban. Akhirnya, 24 jam sebelum keberangkatan kami, kartu kamar tidak lagi berfungsi, meskipun sudah dua kali mengganti kartu. Pada hari Selasa, 21 Februari 2023, setelah enam hari menahan diri dan bersabar, hari pembebasan pun tiba. Check-out dijadwalkan pukul 12 siang, tetapi kami bernegosiasi pukul 1 siang pada hari kedatangan kami. Karena tidak melihat siapa pun pukul 1 siang, kami pikir mungkin dia memberi kami waktu tambahan untuk menebus semua tipuan yang harus kami hadapi. SALAH. Pukul 14.53, telepon rumah lama tahun 1999 yang berfungsi sebagai telepon rumah kami berdering: Halo, pembayarannya jam 12 siang. Di hotel kami, Anda harus membayar biaya tambahan. Kami menolak mentah-mentah. Singkatnya, kami pergi ke resepsionis untuk mengembalikan kartu, dan akhirnya, tidak ada masalah lagi, senyum lebar di wajah kami, dan tidak ada lagi pertanyaan tentang biaya tambahan ini. Intinya, untuk mengakhiri bab panjang ini, pengalaman terburuk dalam hidup saya, sungguh BULLSHIT. Saya pikir itu lelucon atau kamera tersembunyi, tapi sayangnya, itu semua nyata. Oh, dan sarapannya benar-benar tidak enak. Mereka tidak menyediakan cokelat panas, dan layanan meja terbatas. Secara umum, stafnya tidak menyenangkan dan tidak membantu. Ciuman singkat dari tamu yang trauma di kamar 444 dan 328. PS: Semuanya nyata, tanpa melebih-lebihkan atau mengada-ada (itu bagian terburuknya, LOL). Untungnya, hotel pertama kami, Sthala Ubud, BERSIH, TEPAT, dan EFISIEN, kalau tidak, mimpi buruk ini pasti akan merusak seluruh liburan kami. Terakhir, hotel ini terletak 7 menit berkendara dari bandara. Saya tidak akan menjelaskan detail ketidaknyamanan yang disebabkan oleh banyaknya pesawat, dan perlu diketahui bahwa tergantung lokasi kamar Anda, Anda mungkin akan ditempatkan 10-15 menit berjalan kaki dari area sarapan."
"677.","Rosa Groot","5","2020-01-14","1","Itu tidak benar. Saya ingin memberinya 3 bintang. Tapi untuk hotel bintang 5, saya berharap lebih. Kolam renangnya banyak alga, yang menurut saya tidak sehat, dan kamarnya bisa sedikit lebih mewah. Lokasinya tepat di sebelah bandara, tapi itu tidak terlalu mengganggu. Pantainya tertutup karang, jadi Anda tidak bisa berjalan di atasnya. Juga tidak ada kursi berjemur. Stafnya sangat ramah!! Jadi, kami bersenang-senang. PS: Saya menikmati pijat yang luar biasa di pantai dari penduduk setempat selama satu jam dengan biaya 6 euro."
"678.","Antonia Seitz","7","2023-01-14","1","Saya terpaksa menginap semalam di sini karena penerbangan saya dibatalkan. Kamar-kamarnya rusak, dan saya bisa mendengar tetangga saya yang berisik sepanjang malam melalui pintu kayu sederhana (!). Kami harus check out pukul 12.00, jadi saya menghabiskan seharian di tepi kolam renang, tempat musik yang sangat keras diputar tanpa henti. Sungguh menyebalkan; saya tidak bisa melakukan apa pun, bahkan tidur atau bekerja. Setelah saya meminta mereka untuk setidaknya mengecilkan volume sedikit, mereka malah menaikkan volumenya seperti sebelumnya. Makan siangnya juga tidak enak. Toiletnya kotor. Saya senang akhirnya bisa terbang hari ini. Tidak ada yang bisa berbahasa Inggris dengan cukup baik untuk menjelaskan masalah apa pun. Jarang sekali saya merasa sekesal ini dengan hotel."
"679.","Ting E","3","2024-01-14","1","Saat menikmati sarapan prasmanan, pelayan terus bertanya kamar mana yang dimaksud. Menurut saya, itu sangat tidak sopan dan memengaruhi pengalaman bersantap. Apakah ini standar pelayanan hotel bintang lima?"

"681.","Farah Fath","83","2020-01-14","1","Jangan. Pernah. Datang. Ke. Hotel. Ini. Pelayanan resepsionisnya buruk. Wanita di meja depan sangat arogan dan sangat tidak membantu hanya karena saya bukan bule (omong-omong, mereka memperlakukan orang asing dengan lebih baik). Sarapannya biasa saja. Saya makan kentang goreng dan tempe bacem yang sangat asam. Kamarnya juga tidak lebih baik. Sangat berdebu, bau, dan angker. Sering terdengar suara-suara aneh, dan suatu kali pintu di bawah lemari terbuka sendiri. Saya tidak bisa sendirian di kamar sepanjang malam, jadi saya meminta teman-teman saya untuk menemani saya. Satu-satunya hal yang bagus dari hotel ini adalah pemandangan pantainya di mana kita bisa melihat pesawat mendarat di landasan pacu bandara terdekat. Pemandangan yang cocok untuk penggemar penerbangan. Tapi itu saja. Tidak akan kembali meskipun gratis."

Saya meminta untuk dijemput dari kamar karena saya membawa semua barang bawaan (pasangan saya sedang sakit jantung & tidak bisa melakukan aktivitas berat saat ini). Tidak ada yang datang, jadi saya sendiri yang membawa semua barang ke resepsionis. Saya pikir mungkin mereka sudah kembali, tetapi kedua mobil golf masih ada. Selain itu, pemandu wisata yang mereka berikan kepada kami, bernama Ditka, menipu kami dengan mengatakan dia tidak punya uang untuk membayar tol di jembatan. Kami berasumsi kami akan mendapatkan penggantian uang atau potongan harga untuk uang yang kami berikan. Namun, dia tetap tidak punya uang untuk menggantinya. Pengalaman buruk di spa juga. Kamar-kamarnya sangat ketinggalan zaman & hanya memiliki satu kunci (yang menyebalkan jika Anda bepergian berkelompok)."

Teman-teman saya baru saja menerima kartu pos hari ini dan wanita dari staf itu berbohong dan tidak menambahkan perangko lain pada kartu pos, dia menyimpan uangnya untuk dirinya sendiri!!!!

Pas mau balik k room dr lobby, dg 1 ank kecil, 2 lansia, i was waiting at the boogie point (from lobby to my room is quite distance), i already ask the staff to take us and they ask me to wait, trus security dateng sm tamu lain 1 org, my mom nanya ke securitynya bapak yg anter ya? Dan security nya tidak menjawab malah ngomong sm tamu yg dia anterin 😊 sampe tamu yg dateng belakangan itu udh naik boogie car, tamu itu yg nanya ke securitynya ibu nya nga sekalian pak? Trus securitynya ngatau jawab apa, then he left us in confused 😊 after that baru ada staff lain yg dateng (dengan 2 tamu lain yg udah disuruh naik dluan k boogie car) trus staff nya baru blg mau sekalian diantar? I got so pissed omg😭 sm turis asing aja ramah bangettt 😅 tp baca2 di kolom komen ada juga sih bule yg ngeluh hospitality nya 😅 definitely wont spend my 1,8 million rp anymore for 5 star hotel like this 😊"

Menurut saya, itu buruk sekali meanwhile they tread the others ( turis mancanegara) sangat2 baik.. Klo bukan bisnis, tidak akan balik ke hotel ini.. sy bs bayar kamar 3x lipat dari yg di tawarkan di hotel ini untuk menginap di hotel lain.. tolong perbaiki hospitalitynya"

"738.","Marita Bautista","13","2025-12-31","2","Saat ini kami sedang menginap di hotel. Kami sedikit kecewa dengan kondisi kamar, karena handuk tampak compang-camping dan bernoda. Bak mandi juga memiliki noda hitam, yang menunjukkan usia hotel. Aliran air dingin sangat lambat, dan kami tidak yakin apakah ada penyumbatan. Namun, staf memberikan pelayanan yang luar biasa, dan lokasinya sempurna. Kami makan malam Natal tadi malam, yang diiklankan sebagai Natal yang meriah di brosur, tetapi tidak ada hidangan panggang atau barbekyu. Hanya satu hidangan panggang, kalkun, yang disajikan. Kami sedikit kecewa mengingat harga yang kami bayar."
"739.","Kimia Ghajar","8","2025-12-14","2","Kemarin saya tiba untuk memanjakan diri dengan menginap di hotel bintang 5 sebelum penerbangan panjang. Namun, sejak kedatangan saya, saya tidak mengalami hal-hal yang berhubungan dengan hotel bintang 5. Bahkan saat check-in, stafnya benar-benar bingung. Meskipun mereka bertanya apakah saya ingin suite atas atau bawah, mereka ingin memberi saya suite atas. Setidaknya kopi di restoran hotel bintang 5 rasanya enak. Meskipun saya membayar dengan kartu kredit dan mereka memiliki detail saya, saya tidak dapat menagih apa pun ke kartu/tagihan akhir saya. Anda memesan salad dengan tuna dan yang Anda dapatkan bukanlah tuna. Mereka memotongnya begitu halus sehingga Anda bahkan tidak bisa tahu apakah itu tuna. Bagi saya, rasanya seperti ayam. Diskusi panjang lainnya pun terjadi. Akhirnya, mereka memanggil saya ke kamar di malam hari untuk mengatakan bahwa saya belum langsung membayar tagihan. Saya menjelaskan kepada mereka bahwa saya telah memberikan nomor kamar saya dan akan membayar ketika saya check-out. Akhirnya, terjadilah keributan besar dengan harga Rp200.000. Mereka meminta deposit sebesar ini. Anda tidak perlu khawatir tentang jumlah ini jika Anda melakukan pekerjaan dengan baik dan menawarkan kualitas yang baik. Pelanggan akan membayar sendiri jika kualitas dan layanannya tepat. Selain itu, ada banyak proyek konstruksi dan pekerjaan bangunan yang sedang berlangsung di mana-mana, dan restoran Jepangnya tutup. Namun, tidak ada informasi ini di situs web. Hotelnya kumuh dan Anda tidak boleh mengharapkan kualitas hotel bintang 5. Stafnya tidak terlatih dengan baik. Saya akan senang ketika akhirnya bisa check out di sini."
"740.","Amel Seddiki","12","2025-12-14","2","Sayangnya, pengalaman menginap kami di hotel ini cukup mengecewakan. Kamar yang kami terima sangat tua dan tidak seperti foto yang ditampilkan online. Ada juga nyamuk di dalam kamar, yang membuat pengalaman menginap kami sangat tidak nyaman. Kami juga terkejut karena air minum dasar pun tidak disediakan, dan kami diberitahu bahwa kami harus membayarnya — sesuatu yang seharusnya menjadi layanan standar bagi tamu. Secara keseluruhan, pengalaman menginapnya tidak nyaman dan jelas tidak sepadan dengan harganya. Saya harap pihak manajemen meningkatkan kebersihan, merenovasi kamar, dan menyediakan fasilitas dasar yang lebih baik."
