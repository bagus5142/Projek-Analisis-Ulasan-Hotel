"1.","Shekinah Baguhin","4","2025-12-25","5","I give this hotel a 5-star rating. The accommodation was very nice and well maintained. It also has a gym, which I really enjoyed, especially the group exercise room, perfect for an introvert like me who prefers working out in a private space. I also enjoyed the pool a lot. The breakfast buffet was great, offering a wide variety of choices ranging from Asian to Western and American dishes."
"2.","Abdiel Marvega Shindutirta","40","2025-12-01","5","Pullman Thamrin has been one of our favorite hotels in Jakarta for the past few years. Its location is simply perfect — probably the best in the city. Situated right across from Bundaran HI, the very heart of Jakarta, it offers unbeatable convenience and views. We were lucky to stay there over the weekend, when Thamrin Street hosts the Car Free Day, which made our experience even more enjoyable and well-rounded. The staff, as always, were excellent — from the front desk to the restaurant team, the service was top-notch. Not gonna lie, the room was a bit dated, but it was still very well-maintained and clean. We were upgraded to a Junior Suite with a direct view of Plaza Indonesia, which was a lovely surprise. It’s a large hotel with great facilities — they even have a Yayoi Kusama art piece displayed in the gallery. The building itself is an architectural gem, designed by the renowned Japanese architect Kenzo Tange. The lounge, pool, and gym were all fantastic. The breakfast buffet was another highlight — a wide variety of options, and everything we tried tasted great! Special thanks to Mr. Rico for the exceptional service. Can’t wait to return to Pullman Thamrin!"
"3.","Nawwaf Zahra","6","2025-12-01","4","Decided to have a staycation with my mom to celebrate my birthday. For a 5⭐️ hotel, the rooms are okay-ish. You do get a pretty nice view of Bundaran HI, though I think they charge you extra for that (not sure, you can check with the hotel for this). What I had been looking forward to from the stay is actually their breakfast. I was pleased to see the wide variety of food they have in their breakfast buffet. Unfortunately, their Indonesian cuisine landed a tad bit underwhelming for me, especially compared to the other food choices. Their Chinese cuisines were really delicious, though. I hope they could spend the effort to make the Indonesian breakfast as delectable as the others. In good faith, I also have to say that I found the hospitality from the staff to be quite lackluster. At first I thought it was in my head, but then my mom said the same thing as well. Very rarely did the staff engage in small talks or smile while interacting with us. We didn't expect much, just a quick hello or how are you would've sufficed. Everyone was polite enough, of course, but we could feel that there was a certain warmth missing. We tried to assume the best, but comparing my experience at Pullman Jakarta to another famous hotel chain I stayed at a month ago (and it was a 4⭐️ hotel, not 5⭐️), the difference was starking. Overall, it was a pretty enjoyable stay. Some aspects could use improvement, but we did enjoy however short time we had staying there."

We were treated with great courtesy and pampered with services that were genuinely warm and delightful. Superb and excellent service was provided by AAP and Martina, with free-flow jamu and drinks served sincerely and always with a smile. I will carry these wonderful memories of Pullman Jakarta with me, and I will definitely return. Please look forward to my next visit. Love, Michelle Lin Azlina"
"5.","Nur K.","9","2025-12-18","4","Love the reception area but the rooms that we got were dated. Room 536 had issues with the switches. Adjustment of hot water was iffy. Level 5 rooms seem a total different place from the reception ambience. Special shoutout to Pur (Bell) who was very prompt and friendly. Indeed, he represented the hotel well with his warmth and professionalism. Thanks again for your hospitality!"
"6.","Nik Ahmad Farid Nik Mohamed","1","2025-12-01","5","At Sana Sini restaurant, Chairil is very attentive and helpful. Breakfast spread is very extensive and value for money. Jamu drink is superb. Hotel offers strong location but the rooms looking a bit tired and dated. Overall experience is good. Strong contender for a repeat stay."
"7.","Kasi Ram","4","2025-12-11","5","Feedback for Pullman Hotel Jakarta: I would like to start my review by appreciating Bu Yani (Manager), who is always cheerful, supportive, and takes time every day to engage with guests. Her presence truly sets a positive tone for the whole team. **The real asset of Pullman is its people.** From the bellboys to the front office team, everyone is humble, professional, and genuinely cares about guest comfort. I want to take a moment to sincerely thank all the staff members I interact with regularly: - **Mba Reta and Mba Ella** – They are extremely thoughtful and attentive. I once missed my checkout time, and they gently reminded me, making the entire process seamless. They even helped me retrieve my passport, which I had accidentally left behind. Truly commendable service from all the aspects! - **Mas Gerald** – A very pleasant and helpful person who responds to every query with great courtesy and warmth. - **Mba Angel** – Always smiling and proactive in offering food and checking on guests. Her positive energy enhances the dining experience every time. - **Mba Fena** – Ever-present at the front office and lounge, quick in action, and very customer-focused. - **Mba Nazwa and Mba Jesle** – Both are warm, welcoming, and wonderful in their hospitality. Lounge staff har I often work from the lounge, which is always spotless and well-maintained by a hardworking team. The dedication of the lounge staff and chefs is especially commendable — Kudos to the Pullman staff for their dedication, friendliness, and top-notch service. I truly enjoyed my stay and would like to extend my warm greetings and appreciation to the entire team I interact with daily. Pullman Jakarta truly feels like a home away from home!"
"8.","Mochi","21","2025-12-25","5","Thank you to the staff from the reception to the concierge (special mentions to Pur and Ilhan). They were friendly, helpful and welcoming. Hotel rooms were good too but the items such as the ironing board and tv has shown signs of age."
"9.","Nazwa Dhita","4","2025-12-11","5","On behalf of Kitaoneus.asia, We would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to Pullman Hotel Thamrin Indonesia for organizing the Festive Celebration with Inclusion, a truly memorable event that brought joy, creativity, and empowerment to children with intellectual disabilities (tuna grahita) and hearing impairment (tuli). We witnessed firsthand how thoughtfully the entire program was arranged. The children delivered incredible performances: a touching pantomime by children with hearing impairment and a captivating Balinese dance performed by children with intellectual and hearing disabilities. The cooking competition was another highlight, where the children were guided warmly by the Pullman management team. What stood out the most was how the Pullman staff treated the children with dignity, patience, respect, and genuine kindness. The children were visibly joyful throughout the event, and their excitement and pride, especially during the cooking session, were heartwarming to witness. We deeply appreciate Pullman Thamrin’s commitment to supporting inclusive initiatives and providing a safe, welcoming space where every child is celebrated for who they are. Collaborations like this truly make a meaningful difference. Thank you for championing inclusion. We look forward to more impactful collaborations in the future."
"10.","Brutal & Honest Reviewer","421","2025-12-01","4","Weak water pressure for the showers, getting the right temperature is also a challenge - either too hot or too cold. Club lounge offers a poor variety of food. It’s only during breakfast that you get a menu to choose your cooked to order main dish. However the breakfast ala carte food is excellent. Location is great, biggest plus point. Service is not bad too."
"11.","Adel Ali","4","2025-12-18","5","I had a wonderful stay at Pullman Thamrin CBD. The service was exceptional, especially from the concierge staff Jonathan and Hary. They were incredibly helpful throughout my stay. The location is also very convenient, just a short walk away from Plaza Indonesia, Grand Indonesia, and Thamrin City. I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be returning. Thank you!"
"12.","Andi Maulana","6","2025-12-11","5","always enjoy dining at Sana Sini Restaurant at Pullman. I often come here especially for breakfast — the price is just right for the wide variety of dishes, from Indonesian to Japanese and Western. You can also take away the drinks. I’m also really grateful for the service from Mas Aap, who is always attentive and quick to assist, and often recommends great food and drinks for us. He pays special attention to my elderly parents, which we truly appreciate. Once again, thank you Sana Sini Restaurant and Mas Aap for the 6-star service."

Krn suami sy kesini utk meeting, sy kebagian makan d resto 3x sehari ya krn dr grup.. cm mostly tiap makan d resto sy bertiga aja sm anak2 (toddler dan bayi), jd mmg kadang agak rempong hehe sambil makan, sambil nyuapin si kakak, sambil gendong adik Dr sekian banyak staf resto, sy mau ngucap terima kasih sekali utk Pak Aap dan Mbak Martinah, krn jujur tidak ada staf lain selain beliau berdua yg se care itu sm saya :') mgkn krn liat sy kerepotan jg kali ya ngurus bocil2.. tp bener2 kebantu bgt dgn bantuan dr Pak Aap dan Mbak Martinah. Pak Aap terima kasih ya sudah care sm saya, anak saya, selalu nawarin tiap lwt meja saya: mau dibawain apa Bu? Mau dibantu apa Bu? Bahkan sampe ngasih hadiah jg utk si kakak, ngasih jus semangka sm kertas mewarnai dan pensil warna. Beliau jg concern bgt sm posisi meja saya, krn sy bw stroller utk taro si adek, beliau sampe reservasiin tmpt utk saya tiap waktu breakfast d meja paling depan d resto, supaya saya lega naro strollernya, ga ngalangin jalan. MasyaAllah baik sekali beliau.. Mbak Martinah terima kasih yaa, udah ikut concern sm makannya anak saya. Pas sarapan hr kamis kebetulan ada menu opor yg si kakak suka, lalu sy mnt tlg k Mbak Martinah utk bungkusin buat si kakak makan siang nnti, krn sy khawatir menu siangnya gaada menu yg cocok utk si kakak (anaknya agak picky). Mbak Martinah lalu blg kl ketentuan dr managernya tidak diperbolehkan bungkus2 makanan breakfast. Eeh pas sy makan siang, ktmu lg sm Mbak Martinah, beliau senyum ramah sambil nanya k saya gimana Bu, si kakak aman ga makannya? Menu siang ini ada yg cocok ga buat si Kakak?. Wah bener2 saya merasa diperhatiin bgttt sm Mbak Martinah grgr ditanya seperti itu. Mbaknya bener2 baik sekali, dpt gestur dan perhatian kecil spt itu tuh bnr2 berarti bgt lho utk sy sbg tamu yg bw toddler dan bayi :')❤️ Sy tulis review panjang lebar intinya utk beliau berdua hihi. Terima kasih yaa, bener2 perlakuan dan perhatian dr beliau berdua bikin sy terharu. Sy sering ikut suami sy nginep2 d hotel lain area jkt dan bogor, tp ga pernah nemu staff yg se care itu sm saya.. cm disini doang, 2 org ini doang, yg bnr2 bikin tersentuh. Again thank you, for making it the most pleasant stay ever. Dear Pak Aap & Mbak Martinah's manager, please do give both of them some credit and appeciation, they did their job very very well, they deserve it! Definitely akan sy sampaikan k suami sy utk sering2 rapat lagi d pullman thamrin ini❤️"

"15.","Tevy Chawwa","4","2025-12-18","5","Pelayanannya sangat bagus, sarapannya enak dan variatif dibantu Kak Chelsya juga yg ramah. Hanya saja colokan listrik di kamar perlu lebih banyak terutama di dekat meja kerja"
"16.","Wachid Muslimin","61","2025-12-01","4","Been staying here for several times, overall it's quiet comfortable. The only complaint would be a very old tv and old ambience in the room, especially if you are staying in the old building. Please upgrade this, especially the TV as it is important for business people to be able to mirror it with our devices for work."
"17.","Sofi Mardiah","4","2025-12-01","5","Pengalaman menginap yang sangat menyenangkan. Tim front desk yang sangat helpful dan ramah, kami diberikan upgrade secara free untuk kenyamanan keluarga. Kamar yang sangat bersih dan wangi, hingga pelayanan staf yang selalu ramah dan sigap membantu. Sarapan paginya sangat lengkap dengan banyak pilihan menu lokal dan internasional yang lezat, walaupun sudah banyak yang habis pas saya sarapan karena agak terlambat setelah ikut Race dulu. Fasilitas hotel juga lengkap, kolam renang dan gym-nya terlihat bersih serta nyaman, tidak sempat mencoba, mungkin next stay. Lokasinya sangat strategis, dekat dari pusat kota dan fasilitas transportasi publik. Pullman benar-benar memberikan pengalaman menginap yang tak terlupakan. Well done, Pullman!"
"18.","Ahmad Syarifuddin Randiko","454","2025-12-11","4","A decent stay with excellent breakfast options ranging from Indonesian to Western cuisine. The room is compact but has complete amenities like an iron and a bathtub. Just a note on the noise: the soundproofing isn't the best. I could hear traffic noise and activity in the hallway during the night."
"19.","Daniel Wong","3","2025-10-01","5","Pullman experience truly captured the Heart of Jakarta. As a 5-star hotel, its centrally located position can't be beat, putting you right in the middle of the action—literally surrounded by big shopping malls and with the MRT right at the doorsteps for effortless travel. Beyond location, the two in-house restaurants were stellar, delivering exceptional experiences in terms of food, setting, and service. For a perfect nightcap, The Back Door offered a refined atmosphere with a great variety of drinks and whisky. Capping off the great stay, the hotel receptionists were consistently polite and courteous, making check-in and check-out a pleasure."
"20.","Kitaoneus Asia","1","2025-12-11","5","Pullman Jakarta Indonesia truly embodies inclusion and genuine hospitality. We joined the Festive Season Inclusive Event on December 8, 2025, and the experience provided for children with disabilities was exceptional. The Pullman team was warm, attentive, and treated the children with respect, kindness, and compassion. Thank you, Pullman Jakarta Indonesia, for creating a safe, joyful, and inclusive space for these special children. We hope more hotels will follow Pullman’s example in promoting meaningful inclusive activities."

"22.","Alan Pires","13","2025-10-01","5","Pullman Thamrin is a high-quality, well-rounded hotel that does many things right. Its central location is perhaps its greatest asset, making it ideal for guests who want to be in the middle of Jakarta’s action—shopping, business, sightseeing—with minimal travel times. Its wellness facilities (gym + sauna/steam + plunge/hot/cold pools) complement its strength as more than just a place to rest; this is a hotel where you can balance productivity, comfort, and relaxation. If there is room for improvement, it would be in upgrading certain older rooms / towers, improving insulation (especially for street noise), and ensuring that high expectations set by the food and wellness facilities are matched by consistency."
"23.","Yuli Lee","27","2025-12-01","1","Td pas mau breakfast, Om sy, pake kaos&celana pendek + sandal hotel, tp tdk di per boleh kan untuk masuk sarapan!! Katanya tdk boleh pake celana pendek, jd dia naik lg ke atas untk ganti celana panjang.. Begitu turun, eh malah di suruh ganti sendal, tdk boleh pake sendal hotel.. Begini pelayanan yg katanya hotel bintang 5?? Ngerjain org tua yg sudah mau 80tahun naik turun kamar..mau breakfast aja kok ribet sekaliii? Yg mengesalkan, ada org BULE pakai kaos, celana pendek&sendal hotel tapi TDK di permasalahkan, dia boleh masuk untuk breakfast!! Knp OM sy di perlakukan spt ituuu??? Itu namanya diskriminasi!!! Pd hal keluarga kita booked kamar BYK loh..Saudara kita semalem Booked Ball Room di sana jg, untuk Wedding Party nya.. Sungguh kecewa dgn Pullman"
"24.","Erik Eka Putra","249","2025-12-01","5","Pullman Thamrin merupakan hotel yang nyaman dan strategis di pusat Jakarta, dekat dengan mal dan area perkantoran. Kamar bersih dan cukup luas dengan pemandangan kota yang indah, sementara stafnya ramah dan profesional. Sarapan bervariasi dan berkualitas, cocok untuk tamu bisnis maupun liburan. Namun, suara dari jalan utama terkadang masih terdengar di beberapa kamar. Secara keseluruhan, pengalaman menginap di sini menyenangkan dan layak direkomendasikan untuk siapa pun yang ingin menginap di jantung kota Jakarta."
"25.","Sarah Hafidz","12","2025-11-01","4","We stayed at Pullman just for 1 night, had a good and relaxing stay here. The location is good, where we could just walk to Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia, and if you are adventurous enough you can even walk to Thamrin area. The view was also nice. I had informed that we were celebrating a birthday and was pleased that the staffs drew a wish in the room (on a mirror) and even gave us a bday cake (along with bday song!). So a huge shout out to Nazwa, Josslyn & Acha for going the extra mile in making my day special."
"26.","woro bawono","1","2025-12-01","5","Agar dipertahankan dan dijaga kualitas yg sudah baik. Kamar nyaman dan cukup untuk istirahat. Makanan sangat bervariatif dan enak-enak. Saat sarapan dilayani oleh Mbak Lintang, orangnya helpful dan responsif."

"28.","Leo L","65","2025-12-01","2","We arrived in Jakarta for the BLACKPINK concert and were scheduled to check in at 3 PM. Unfortunately, no rooms were available, so we had to wait until 5 PM—making us late for the show. The delay stemmed from a dispute between the housekeeping team and the front desk. The front desk did their best to resolve it, but the standard policy is clear: guests must check out by 12 PM to allow check-in after 3 PM. Everyone needs to respect these rules. Another odd point: every car entering the hotel grounds to pick up guests is charged a parking fee, even for a quick drop-off or pickup—which feels unreasonable."

"44.","Yamin Waryana","226","2025-12-01","5","Pullman Jakarta Indonesia Thamrin CBD is a five-star hotel located on Jalan M.H. Thamrin, Jakarta. It is one of four hotels surrounding the Selamat Datang Monument. It was opened in 1972 as part of the Wisma Nusantara complex, a skyscraper that once held the record for the tallest building in Indonesia until 1983. Initially managed by Nikko Hotels, the hotel has been operated by Accor under the Pullman brand since 2012. It is owned by PT Wisma Nusantara International, the majority of whose shares are owned by a Singaporean company, Guthrie GTS. History The construction of this hotel is closely tied to Wisma Nusantara, a skyscraper whose design was initiated by President Sukarno in 1964. Due to the hyperinflation [id] that struck Indonesia at the time, the construction was halted until 1969, when the Indonesian government under President Suharto secured cooperation with Mitsui to resume building the 30-story tower. The project was then expanded to include a star-rated hotel intended for Japanese businessmen staying in Jakarta.[1] With Kajima, Taisei Corporation, and Total Bangun Persada [id] as contractors and a budget of Rp11.5 billion, construction began in April 1970 and was completed in November 1972. Suharto and Jakarta Governor Ali Sadikin inaugurated the President Hotel on 2 December 1972. Its management was entrusted to Japan Airlines Development, Ltd., a subsidiary of Japan Airlines, which would later be rename Nikko Hotels . The Indonesian government held a 55% stake in the hotel, while Mitsui and Japan Airlines held 40% and 5%, respectively.[1] On 14 May 1986, the President Hotel was attacked by the left-wing militant group Japanese Red Army. The militants also targeted the United States and Japan [id] embassies in Jakarta. There were no casualties as the bombs planted failed to detonate. The mastermind behind the attack, Tsutomu Shirosaki, was eventually captured by the United States and sentenced to 30 years in prison in 1998.[2][1][3] The President Hotel was renovated between July 1987 and July 1991 to refurbish guest rooms, restaurants, and the convention hall. This also reduced the number of rooms from 354 to 315. The renovation was inaugurated on 26 July 1991, by Vice President Soedharmono. In October 1992, Indocement acquired a 31% stake in the hotel. After the fall of the New Order regime, both the Indonesian government and Indocement sold their shares to Guthrie GTS, a Singapore-based property company, while Mitsui retained a minority stake in PT Wisma Nusantara International.[1] In March 2003, the President Hotel inaugurated a 14-story extension located to the north of the original building, constructed by PP Taisei and Total Bangun Persada, and designed by Kenzo Tange & Associates. The new building increased the room capacity to 427. At the same time, the name was changed to Hotel Nikko Jakarta.[4] On 19 January 2012, after nearly 30 years, the hotel ended its partnership with Nikko Hotels. Accor was invited to manage the hotel under the Pullman Hotels and Resorts brand, and the hotel was subsequently renamed Pullman Jakarta Indonesia Thamrin CBD.[5] The hotel underwent another renovation by Singapore-based architecture firm Wilson & Associates, which was completed on 13 February 2014.[6]"

Some odd policy in the macaroon cafe that you can not move the couch when I want to host a group of 4. The lady was strong opiniated and inconsiderate that I could not move a single couch and only recommend high chairs. My mom is 82 yo, how can she sit on highchair? I would not come back to Pullman MH Thamrin. Not too impressed with the service and property quality"

"69.","DMUSE MAGZ","1","2025-11-01","3","⭐ 3 Stars I usually have a very good experience at Pullman Jakarta, especially at the lounge where my boss (who frequently travels from India for business) and I often work during his stays. The lounge staff have always been friendly, professional, and accommodating. However, on September 6th, I had an unpleasant encounter with one staff member, Ms. Victoria Fina. That evening, I was working alone in the lounge when she approached me in a rather harsh manner, asking for my room number and then questioning if my boss would be joining. When I replied that he was resting, she said, “Sorry, it’s just for one person.” I found this interaction both embarrassing and inconsistent, especially since I’ve often seen families and even groups using the lounge without issue. It felt unnecessary and unfriendly, unlike the welcoming service I usually receive here. I hope management will address this, as hospitality should always be consistent and respectful."
"70.","Novita Indah (-)","21","2025-08-01","5","Staycation di Pullman Jakarta jadi pengalaman yang menyenangkan buat aku. Lokasinya strategis banget—dekat dengan mall, pusat keramaian, tempat makan, dan bisa sekalian CFD-an di hari Minggu pagi. Waktu pertama kali nginap di sini, aku dapat upgrade ke kamar dengan city view. Memang harus nunggu agak lama sih buat check-in, tapi begitu lihat pemandangan malam dari atas—terutama area HI—semuanya terbayar. Worth the wait! Sarapan di sini juga juara. Pilihannya banyak dan rasanya enak-enak. Nggak berlebihan kalau dibilang salah satu hotel dengan breakfast terbaik yang pernah aku coba."
"71.","annisa azka nabilah","10","2025-07-01","1","Worst experience stayed at pullman. Unfriendly check in staff, and we have to wait 1hr and half just to get our room. 1.5 hr. And we have yo wait with our toddler. Thanks to mbak fathia, who helped us to get our room, after 1.5 hr waiting without any confirmation. The peak season because it was long weekend was an excuse that i couldn’t accepted. Because it supposed to be prepared and anticipated for a 5 stars hotel chain 👌🏻 And there were another accident on breakfast by sana sini restourant. Jadi saya duduk di kursi untuk 4 orang, saya sefang menyuapi anak saya dan menunggu suami saya yang akan datang menyusul, tiba tiba staff restourant menempatkan another guest di kursi kami tanpa konfirmasi ke saya. Saya gak ngerti apakah staff tersebut tidak punya mulut untuk mengkonfirmadi atau saya terlihat seperti barang yang tidak perlu untuk dikonfirmasi dan mereka bisa memperlakukan dengan seenaknya. Lalu kami dibantu mas rivan untuk pindah kursi. Dan mas rico yang mendengarkan keberatan kami. Tapi staff perempuan yg lalai dengan menempatkan tamu seenaknya tanpa konfirmasi itu sama sekali tidak ada permintaan maaf ke kami. Bahkan setelah iru para petugas malah terlihat menghindari meja kami, bahkan ketika saya minta orange juice untuk putri saya (karena tidak tersedia di food bar) sama sekali tidak dikeluarkan. Kamar juga kurang bagus. Tv bahkan bukan smart tv. Berdebu. Inner gorden yg seharusnya warna putih berwarna abu abu saking berdebunya. Jendela berkarat. What a great stay at pullman thamrin. Bedaaaaa jauh hanget hospitalitynya dengan pullman lombok dan pullman ciawi. Please consider your stay at pullman thamrin. You have better options like kempinski, grand hyatt, & mandarin oriental with similar rate but better hospitality."

The check-in process was smooth and seamless. I stayed at the Deluxe room, which is very spacious and has ample space for lounging around, relax, and for work. The bathroom has all the amenities needed, clean, and spacious. The hotel exterior may look old, but the inside looks refurbished and renovated. Regardless, the facilities were clean and well taken care of. Throughout my stay, the customer service has been superb; I was greeted every single time and felt really welcome. The location is also very strategic, just steps away from shopping malls and restaurants."

Fasilitas gedung, kamar hotel, kolam renang, gym, parkir, dll, tidak pernah mengecewakan Lokasi hotel sangat strategis. Service para staff umumnya memuaskan. Kecuali saat late lunch di The Back Room, kisaran 30 - 31 Maret 2024 lalu. Itu hanya pesan menu Indonesia sederhana (Nasi goreng, tempe mendoan, dll) Tapi waiting time nya sangat lama lebih dari 20 menit, padahal hanya kami yang pesan. Tidak ada tamu lain. Dan taste nya juga gak karuan. Nasi goreng nya luar biasa asin sampai gak sanggup dihabiskan. Tempe mendoan dll sebaliknya, malah hambar gak ada rasa... hehe.. Padahal ini hotel bintang 5 lho.. Why?? Semoga ke depan bs lebih paripurna service nya."

Fasilitas lengkap dan kolam renangnya luas. Pelayanan room servis sangat baik. Point minus : Dengan harga yang sangat lumanyan, kamarnya terasa sangat sempit sekali. Akses didalam gedung parkir sangat susah bermanuver karena agak sempit tetapi akses parkiran luar cukup luas. Pelayanan di resto saat breakfast kurang ramah, nafsu makan jadi berkurang melihat staff-staff yang kurang ramah seperti ini. Kami menginap saat ada acara nikahan sehingga aktifitas dilobby utama menjadi sangat padat dan agak mengganggu Overall masih recommended untuk tempat staycation bersama keluarga"

Before 2024, my most recent stay was last year in the Superior room, in the old tower (is that how you call it?) I remember my stay in the renovated room to be quite great, but last year I'm so disappointed at the state of the Superior room. It is very outdated with a small bathroom, and i HATED the bath tub curtains. Makes it feel like a 3 star hotels. Now I stayed at the Deluxe room, also in the old tower. Quite decent, with the sofa and larger bathroom. But again with the curtains! It's so old and a big mess, it's hard to function, again, i HATED it. Makes the room look cheap. I feel like you could renovate the whole old rooms, it is very outdated. The whole room design is outdated. For a hotel with great location (literally at the heart of Jakarta), you're gonna have to catch up with your competitors. You can do better. (I appreciate the hospitality of the staff. Good work there.)"

It's a nice property and there are 2 wings. I was lodged into an executive room in the new wing. The rooms are big and comfy and all necessary things are inside. There was no issue in transportation as well. All kind of taxis are available and the hotel staff is extremely supportive in getting one. The room service was good and the chef was able to customize dish as per my requirement. The breakfast spread is huge and amazing. I haven't seen such a big spread in longtime. Here also the staff is absolutely welcoming and it makes your day right in the morning. Here I would specially like to mention the food or breakfast manager ( apologies, i forgot his name). He was so polite and supportive going out of the way to arrange an Indian spread for me even though it was not part of normal breakfast spread. So over all a very nice experience which will make me book again over there. P.S. I would request hotel management to consider setting a counter for Indian breakfast as well. I could see so many travellers who looked like Indian. And since Indians are travelling more and more now a days it would be a good idea to have such a counter as this could be a big motivation for Indian customers."

During entry the reception clearly explained the details of the stay. The room was clean and sufficient for a single person. The bathroom was provided with bathtub with other amenities. Steamer iron ,coffee and kettle was also not missed. To mention more swimming pool was good and timing was till 9 pm. That was ecstasy. Additionally Sauna , jacuzzi and steam was also provided.All were maintained neat and good. The helper at the Sauna explained very clearly about the facilities. I addition the hotel is located in prime area where you can have access to huge malls. Finally it was worth staying at this wonderful hotel.The breakfast option was excellent I will explain separately"

Sebelum acara ada makan siang, ketika saya datang, makanan kebanyakan sudah habis dan ternyata tidak refill, gelas sempat agak lama kosong sehingga ada teman saya minum dengan mangkok. Makanan juga tidak sesuai ekspektasi saya dari bintang lima. Ayam nya tidak ada rasa, kambing guling nya ada bagian yang alot, yang paling mending itu soto ayam nya, agak ada rasa nya. Gedung nya sendiri bagus, rapi, di toilet ada hand lotion. Akses hotel sangat mudah dan strategis, area parkir juga luas."

Dissapointed at the gym, pool and sauna. Cleanliness in the bathrooms is neglected. Truly a great decline of service and quality. Been a member at the gym for more than 5 years before a long break, would expect the quality to improve over the years. Apparently that went south."
"292.","Jay Park (Jiheon)","60","2025-01-01","5","Choosing this hotel located in the heart of Jakarta's central area was the best decision. Not only does the hotel boast facilities befitting its rating, but the professional staff truly added value to the experience. It was a stroke of luck to enjoy such value alongside an excellent price. Especially, Eno, Dita, and Cipta at the club lounge ensured a comfortable start to exploring the unfamiliar city, surpassing the standards of a concierge with joy. The chef at the club lounge served dishes that elicited admiration, showing deep consideration even for preferences regarding spiciness. The dining experience was of such exceptional quality that it was eagerly anticipated. Ajeng, Eko, and Bobby at The Back Room provided service that epitomized satisfaction with this hotel. Their warmth and endless laughter during conversations made for a delightful time, reminiscent of meeting long-lost friends. The satisfaction with the facilities and the welcoming care from the staff surpassing it will definitely make me choose this hotel again for my next trip."

Musholla di lantai 2 dan nyaman juga, bersih. Buffetnya sih paling highlight dari pullman ini, buffetnya besar dengan pilihan makanan beragam (indonesia, western, japan etc), gelatonya enak, tapi dulu perasaaan ada pilihan granola buat opsi crumblesnya kok kemarin tidak ada lagi yah granolanya hehe.

Nevertheless, I ended up staying for 2 nights. The restaurant and breakfast service were the highlights of my experience, offering the best service and enjoyable moments. Please improve, Pullman."

The breakfast are great, since it’s NYE the hotel are quite packed… yet the food are never empty, there’s no long queues for food or drinks, and the tables are always available. Didn’t get to check the pool by myself but but my little sister did have fun with the swimming pool for three days in a row. I found everything to be satisfying since the location of the hotel is very strategic, my family could visit nearby places by walking distance.. The only downside from their room is about their cleanliness but we get it because it’s NYE, at the end of the day everything that we experienced was worthy with their offered price."

Please...Level top manejemen hotelnya harus memperbaiki diri, ini jauh sekali dibawah standar pullman hotel lain di Indonesia, sangat menyedihkan.

And we have yo wait with our toddler. Thanks to mbak fathia, who helped us to get our room, after 1.5 hr waiting without any confirmation. The peak season because it was long weekend was an excuse that i couldn’t accepted. Because it supposed to be prepared and anticipated for a 5 stars hotel chain 👌🏻 And there were another accident on breakfast by sana sini restourant. Jadi saya duduk di kursi untuk 4 orang, saya sefang menyuapi anak saya dan menunggu suami saya yang akan datang menyusul, tiba tiba staff restourant menempatkan another guest di kursi kami tanpa konfirmasi ke saya. Saya gak ngerti apakah staff tersebut tidak punya mulut untuk mengkonfirmadi atau saya terlihat seperti barang yang tidak perlu untuk dikonfirmasi dan mereka bisa memperlakukan dengan seenaknya. Lalu kami dibantu mas rivan untuk pindah kursi. Dan mas rico yang mendengarkan keberatan kami. Tapi staff perempuan yg lalai dengan menempatkan tamu seenaknya tanpa konfirmasi itu sama sekali tidak ada permintaan maaf ke kami. Bahkan setelah iru para petugas malah terlihat menghindari meja kami, bahkan ketika saya minta orange juice untuk putri saya (karena tidak tersedia di food bar) sama sekali tidak dikeluarkan. Kamar juga kurang bagus. Tv bahkan bukan smart tv. Berdebu. Inner gorden yg seharusnya warna putih berwarna abu abu saking berdebunya. Jendela berkarat. What a great stay at pullman thamrin.

"347.","Ghinaa Amadea","6","2024-01-21","1","Saya kurang suka sama pelayanan satpam dan waitress yang membeda-bedakan berdasarkan pakaian. Saya jalan waktu CFD saya pakai baju yang menurut saya nyaman. Saya di cek semua tas dan barang bawaannya termasuk rekan saya. Sedangkan depan saya ada perempuan 2 dengan baju yang lebih bagus dari saya mereka tidak dicek tasnya dan langsung saja diminta masuk. Menurut pak satpam apakah saya mencuri dan dia tidak? atau mencurigai apa? Kenapa ada diskriminasi dan dibedakan berdasarkan pakaian? Saya kurang suka pelayanan yang membeda bedakan orang. Kita tidak tahu sebenarnya sekaya apa dan seperti apa orang tersebut. Sebaiknya segi pelayanan dan keramahan ditingkatkan serta diskriminasi di Pullman dikurangi karena saya kurang suka jika orang dibeda bedakan berdasarkan pakaian. Mohon ditindaklanjuti. Satpam yang berjaga yaitu satpam dipintu masuk sebelah busway Trans Jakarta pagi ini Minggu, 9 Juli 2023. Saya tidak bermaksud apa apa saya hanya kurang suka dengan pelayanan dan sikapnya mohon maaf sebelumnya apabila ada kalimat saya yang menyakiti pihak tertentu 🙏🏻 Terima kasih🙏🏻"

Namun harus menunggu hingga pukul 18.30 untuk mendapatkan kamar. Kurang komunikasi satu sama lain dan staff hotel terkesan menghindari tamu-tamu yang sedang menunggu penjelasan adalah hal yang paling terlihat ketika mereka menangani krisis. Pullman sepertinya harus membenahi crisis management mereka dengan tidak menghindari tamu. Akibat penghindaran mereka, banyak tamu yang akhirnya marah karena tidak mendapat penjelasan yang masuk akal atas suplai linen yang membuat pelayanan hotel tersendat. Bahkan request handuk yang sudah disampaikan malam sebelumnya belum bisa dipenuhi oleh Pullman tanpa penjelasan sampai check out. Terima kasih Pullman"

Kami membayar harga penuh, dan jika ada keterlambatan check-in, seharusnya ada kompensasi (misalnya, diskon yang signifikan). Tirai perlu dicuci, dan ada banyak noda kecil di kamar.

"412.","SAAD","30","2024-01-21","1","Pengalaman saya di hotel ini sungguh mengecewakan dan tidak akan pernah terulang. Dimulai dengan AC yang buruk, yang sama sekali tidak nyaman untuk tidur.

Bantalnya keras dan tidak nyaman. Responsivitas dan pelayanannya agak kurang memuaskan. Pemeriksaan keamanan dilakukan setiap saat saat memasuki hotel. Lokasinya selalu ramai. Berdasarkan pengalaman pribadi, saya tidak merekomendasikan menginap di sini."
"413.","The Intelligentia","2","2023-01-21","1","Ini mungkin salah satu pengalaman hotel terburuk yang pernah saya alami. Karena sedang musim ramai, kami tidak bisa memesan kamar di hotel lain yang awalnya kami rencanakan. Sejak memasuki properti, petugas keamanan bahkan tidak berinisiatif untuk menyambut atau membantu kami membawakan bagasi. Kami benar-benar menunggu (berdiri) selama hampir 45 menit di konter check-in. Bukan karena banyaknya tamu yang mengantre, tetapi staf resepsionis bekerja sangat lambat. Kedua, sarapan hanya berlaku untuk 1 orang meskipun kami memesan 1 kamar. Mereka bilang kami hanya memasukkan 1 tamu, jadi sarapan hanya berlaku untuk 1 orang. Ini mungkin salah satu hal paling konyol yang pernah saya dengar. 2. Belum lagi kamarnya. Sangat kecil meskipun kami memesan kamar premium. Desain interiornya tua, karpetnya berdebu, dan kamar mandinya kecil. Jika Anda punya pilihan, saya sangat menyarankan Anda untuk mencari hotel lain di area ini dengan harga yang sama tetapi menawarkan layanan yang lebih baik. Pertama dan terakhir kalinya saya menginap di Pullman."
"414.","Mr Visitor","182","2025-01-21","1","KELEBIHAN: - Kamar besar dengan tempat tidur nyaman. - Hak istimewa Accor Plus diberikan. Upgrade kamar, voucher minuman, check-out terlambat, dll. - Staf Privilege Lounge ramah dan membantu. Mereka juga membantu mencetak beberapa dokumen. - Area kolam renang luar ruangan yang luas untuk berenang dan bersantai. - Bar di lantai dasar bernama The Back Room adalah tempat yang tepat untuk bersantai dan menikmati minuman. Stafnya profesional dan membuat koktail yang luar biasa. KELEMAHAN: - Staf menagih saya dua kali untuk pemesanan saya. Hotel menagih kartu kredit saya 4 hari sebelum check-in untuk jumlah penuh. Saat check-in, saya diminta membayar lagi menggunakan kartu yang berbeda. Akhirnya, kami membayar dua kali untuk kamar yang sama. Masih belum ada tanda-tanda pengembalian dana atau pemberitahuan kapan pengembalian dana ini akan diterima. Ini sangat tidak biasa dan sepertinya penipuan. Hotel mana yang menagih pelanggan dua kali untuk satu kamar? Ini cara yang buruk untuk memperlakukan tamu, terutama anggota platinum. Menjijikkan. - Privilege Lounge kecil dengan pilihan makanan dan minuman terbatas. - Akses menjadi masalah di hotel ini. Anda mungkin mengira Anda sedang mengunjungi bandara karena mereka memiliki pemindai tas dan staf yang memeriksa setiap gerakan Anda sebelum memasuki hotel. Hal ini membuat prosesnya lebih lama dari yang seharusnya. Mobil Grab terpaksa masuk dari belakang hotel dan berputar-putar. Keamanan memeriksa setiap mobil - sekali lagi memperlambat perjalanan dan kebebasan Anda. Hal ini menjadi merepotkan setiap kali Anda meninggalkan atau tiba di hotel ini. - Area kolam renang tersembunyi dengan papan petunjuk yang terbatas. Harus meminta petunjuk kepada 3 staf karena tidak ada petunjuk arah yang jelas. Ternyata Anda harus berjalan melalui area spa sebelum mencapai kolam renang. Ini berlawanan dengan intuisi dan membutuhkan banyak jalan kaki. - Sarapan prasmanan memiliki banyak variasi tetapi tidak ada daging babi asap - meskipun ada Bagian Barat. Kue-kue keringnya keras dan rapuh - mungkin sudah 3 hari. Area ini menampung sekitar 100+ orang. Namun masih ada 1 pemanggang roti untuk semua orang. Benar-benar lelucon. Makanan juga lambat diisi ulang. Mungkin karena akhir pekan yang sibuk - tetapi untuk hotel bintang 5, hal-hal sederhana ini seharusnya tidak menjadi masalah 🤷 Secara keseluruhan, pengalaman menginap ini mengecewakan dan mungkin merupakan layanan terburuk dari semua pengalaman menginap kami di hotel-hotel afiliasi Accor. Setelah ditipu dengan 2 pembayaran, pengalaman di Pullman Thamrin gagal memenuhi standar bintang 5. Saya masih mengejar poin Accor ALL untuk menginap ini dan masih belum mendengar kabar tentang pengembalian dana karena membayar dua kali. Saya tidak akan merekomendasikan menginap di sini kecuali Anda suka stres, membuang-buang waktu, dan membayar dua kali untuk menginap. Saya yakin manajer akan membalas dengan pesan yang meminta maaf atas pengalaman Anda - tetapi tolong sebutkan perubahan konkret yang telah Anda lakukan untuk membuat pengalaman menginap tamu lebih baik? Jika tidak, itu tidak ada artinya. JUGA TOLONG KEMBALIKAN UANG SAYA!"

Dua hari setelah itu kami turun ke bawah untuk sarapan, dan 5 menit setelah itu petugas kebersihan masuk ke kamar kami, meskipun kami sudah memasang tanda 'jangan diganggu', dan ketika kami kembali ke kamar, kami menemukan Sdb terbuka, dan saya menemukan uang tunai saya telah hilang sejumlah 2000 AED, semua yang saya jelaskan di atas sesuai dengan penjelasan dari Duty Manager hotel, berdasarkan pelacakan CCTV dan pelacakan Sdb di kamar kami, Kami telah melaporkan kejadian ini ke Polda Metro Jaya, tetapi hingga hari ini belum ada tindak lanjut dari pihak hotel Pullman dan pihak berwenang.

Staf keamanan juga menunjukkan mentalitas yang rendah, tidak mampu membedakan tamu dari pengunjung umum sehingga memperlakukan orang dengan buruk.

"424.","Ernesto Fries Urioste","110","2024-01-21","1","Perlakuan yang tidak ramah, resepsionis dan bellboy (yodi) berbicara negatif tentang saya dan istri saya, padahal istri saya berdiri di dekatnya. Apakah resepsionis tidak mengerti konsep check-out ekspres? Sarapannya lezat. Ukuran kamarnya lumayan. Beberapa hal tidak berjalan sesuai rencana, dan petugas berulang kali meminta maaf. Meskipun demikian, saya merasa mereka tahu persis apa yang harus dikatakan untuk meminta maaf, tetapi tidak tulus maupun tidak tertarik. Peristiwa yang melibatkan bellboy dan komentar negatif resepsionis tentang kami hanyalah puncak gunung es. Kami kena nyamuk di hotel dan harus membeli obat nyamuk dari Gojek karena kami disuruh menunggu sampai keesokan harinya, dll. Sebagai pelancong yang sering bepergian dengan ratusan malam per tahun dan status tertinggi di tiga program hotel (Marriott, Hilton, IHG), sejujurnya saya tidak peduli dengan peningkatan yang diberikan, tetapi saya peduli dengan keramahan, layanan, dan kejujuran. Jika karyawan tidak suka bekerja di sini, mereka seharusnya mencari pekerjaan di toko kelontong, bukan di industri perhotelan. Anda harus menyadari bahwa pelanggan yang check-out pukul 5 pagi sedang terburu-buru. Waktu respons staf tidak dapat diterima, dan sungguh tidak menyenangkan berbicara negatif tentang saya dan istri saya sementara mereka tidak menjalankan tugas mereka dengan efektif. Merupakan tanggung jawab Anda untuk memberi tahu saya bahwa bengkel mobil tutup di pagi hari; bukan tanggung jawab istri saya untuk menelepon saya kembali ketika dia tahu telepon saya sedang dalam mode senyap!! Dan saya menemukan pintu garasi tertutup dan harus kembali ke meja depan untuk berbicara dengan resepsionis yang tidak mengetahui opsi check-out cepat. Saya kemudian harus berlarian di sekitar gedung, kembali dengan mobil saya, dan mengemasi mobil saya hampir sendirian karena petugas hotel kabur. Tanggapan standar merupakan bentuk ketidakhormatan lebih lanjut kepada pelanggan Anda. Tanggapan yang saya lihat di bagian ulasan adalah teks impersonal, seringkali dengan nama yang salah."
"425.","Will","210","2021-01-21","1","Saya pernah makan siang prasmanan di sini, rasa makanannya bahkan tidak sampai 3 bintang, dan juru masaknya kurang memadai sehingga antreannya cukup panjang. Saya tidak mendapat informasi tentang antrean di balik pembatas, jadi banyak orang yang menggunakan pembatas itu sebagai antrean, lalu petugas keamanan datang dan menyuruh orang-orang untuk antre di belakangnya. Pengalaman yang kurang menyenangkan. Saya tidak akan merekomendasikan makan siang di sini kepada keluarga dan teman-teman saya."
"426.","Wong Francis","1061","2025-01-21","1","Ulasan ini untuk bulan Juni 2024. 4 tahun setelah kunjungan terakhir saya. Saya anggota emas Accor untuk tahun ke-3. Accor memberikan diskon 30% untuk harga kamar, dan setelah Covid dan bertahun-tahun kemudian, saya pikir semuanya akan lebih baik. Ternyata saya salah besar?! Kamarnya persis sama, kuno, kedap suara buruk sehingga suara lalu lintas masuk. Saat memesan kamar (untuk 2 orang) melalui aplikasi mereka, saya menambahkan sarapan untuk menginap. Saat check-out, saya diminta membayar sarapan untuk tamu tambahan?! Ternyata mereka mengakui itu kesalahan komputer, tetapi bersikeras saya harus membayar tetapi dengan potongan harga. Jika saya memilih untuk tidak membayar, mereka akan mengambil pembayaran dari kantong staf restoran sendiri. Bagi saya, itu bukan cara bicara yang berkelas. Tentu saja, saya membayar, tetapi itu meninggalkan kesan yang sangat buruk. Lokasinya sangat bagus, tetapi tetap saja, saya tidak akan kembali lagi, meskipun gratis. Mereka punya banyak masalah. Selamat tinggal, Pullman, dan halo, Grand Hyatt!"
"427.","Lissa Liberty","2","2023-01-21","1","ini adalah kali pertama dan terakhir saya menginap di hotel ini. untuk standar hotel bintang 5, hotel ini sangat tidak layak, kamarnya cukup kecil, sangat kotor, dan berbau rokok (fyi, saya pesan kamar yang non-smoking), selain itu pelayanannya juga tidak terlalu bagus, dan stafnya sangat kasar, responnya lama, dan ketika Anda melaporkan masalah Anda, jangan harap ditanggapi dan ditindaklanjuti, mereka akan mengabaikannya saja, dan untuk harga hotel bintang 5 yang cukup mahal, saya sarankan Anda bisa menginap di hotel bintang 5 yang lain. lebih baik di area yang sama, misalnya Hotel Indonesia kempinski atau grand hyatt yang tidak pernah mengecewakan saya."
"428.","Suki Wijaya","1","2018-01-21","1","Saya mencoba hotel ini karena email promosi dari Le Club untuk mendapatkan 6000 poin hanya dengan 1 kali menginap, jadi pada tanggal 17 Agustus yang merupakan hari libur di Indonesia, saya memutuskan untuk menginap di sini. Ketika saya check-in, saya sengaja memberi tahu petugas itu bahwa saya adalah anggota platinum SPG dan anggota berlian Hilton...untuk memberi tahu dia bahwa saya sering bepergian, dan juga karena saya tahu biasanya jika hotel kosong seperti tanggal 17 Agustus (pada dasarnya semua hotel di Jakarta akan cukup kosong pada hari ini), mereka akan meng-upgrade saya setidaknya ke kategori berikutnya.... Saya juga telah meminta upgrade dan dengan tegas menolak, Dia hanya mengatakan dia akan meng-upgrade saya jika saya adalah anggota platinum ACCOR... Saya tidak marah karena sebelum saya melihat kamar saya baik-baik saja tanpa upgrade... Hanya saja menurut saya ketika hotel kosong, Anda harus memberikan kamar terbaik Anda kepada pelanggan Anda. Ketika saya memasuki kamar, saya terkejut karena kamarnya sangat kecil, bahkan sulit untuk menemukan ruang untuk meletakkan koper saya yang berukuran 24 inci. Saya juga mencoba layanan kamar, menunya memang terlalu mahal!! Bahkan jika saya membandingkannya dengan hotel bintang 5 lainnya di Jakarta, kualitasnya biasa saja. Satu hal terbaik dari hotel ini adalah sarapannya, ini adalah salah satu tempat sarapan terbaik di Hotel Jakarta, dalam hal kualitas dan variasi.... Saat check-out, petugas yang sama yang memeriksa saya bertanya lagi bagaimana pengalaman menginap saya. Saya bilang kamarnya sangat kecil dan jawabannya adalah YA, untuk tipe kamar seperti itu, memang agak kecil... Saya bilang SUPER kecil, tidak terlalu kecil... dan petugas itu hanya diam saja setelah itu.... Apa gunanya bertanya kepada pelanggan bagaimana pengalaman menginapnya jika dia tidak melakukan apa pun untuk mengatasinya? Menurut saya, lebih baik tidak bertanya apa-apa. Singkatnya: saya tidak akan kembali.. saya hanya akan menginap di hotel saya yang biasa di Double Tree by Hilton atau hotel SPG mana pun yang menghargai saya sebagai pelanggan dan di mana saya bisa merasa seperti di rumah sendiri....."
"429.","Mohammed Alkaff","279","2024-01-21","1","Ini adalah salah satu pengalaman terburuk yang pernah saya alami dengan grup Accor. 1. Check-in: Staf meja depan Alden. Mereka meng-upgrade kamar, dan ketika saya meminta tambahan satu jam untuk check-out, mereka menurunkan kamar dengan imbalan satu jam! Sungguh, dan itu setelah 15 menit menunggu persetujuan manajer shift mereka! 2. Waktu check-out saya pukul 14.00, pukul 13.15, seseorang mengetuk pintu, dalam 5 detik mereka mengetuk lagi, dan mereka langsung membuka pintu kamar, saya benar-benar berada di kamar kecil, dan pintu kamar kecil dibuka, benar-benar tidak tahu harus berbuat apa! Saya bilang tunggu, dan pergi menemui mereka, saya menemukan manajer meja depan mengatakan bahwa saya harus meninggalkan kamar, saya bilang saya punya waktu sampai pukul 14.00, dia bilang itu tidak diperbarui dalam sistem! Padahal mereka bisa saja menelepon ke kamar dan bertanya kepada saya alih-alih menonton film ini. Bahkan tombol non-ganggu pun aktif, tetapi mereka tidak peduli. 3. Saat check-out: Saya meminta untuk bertemu dengan manajer hotel, lagi-lagi Alden, resepsionis, mengatakan bahwa dia tidak berwenang menghubungi manajer hotel, dan dia memblokir saya. Setelah saya bersikeras, dia berbohong lagi dengan mengatakan bahwa manajer hotel tidak bertanggung jawab karena hari Sabtu, padahal sebenarnya hari kerja Jumat dan manajer hotel ada di sana. 4. Harus saya akui, manajer resepsionis sudah berusaha sebaik mungkin untuk meminta maaf, dan akhirnya, manajer hotel datang dan mencoba meminta maaf dengan cara yang baik sambil berjanji untuk memperbaikinya di masa mendatang. Mereka menawarkan saya peningkatan kamar atau layanan makanan, tetapi saya tidak menerimanya. Saya rasa ini tidak akan terjadi di Hotel Accor bintang 5."
"430.","Corazon Bernardus","6","2023-01-21","1","Nona Katrina di resepsionis mungkin perlu memperbaiki keramahannya. Anda tidak perlu langsung menolak permintaan saya, padahal yang saya minta hanyalah validasi parkir selama saya menginap. Dengan menyuruh saya langsung menemui petugas concierge dengan nada menolak seperti itu (mungkin karena Anda merasa itu bukan tugas Anda), saya 100% yakin tidak mengharapkan hal seperti itu dari staf Hotel PULLMAN. Syukurlah Pak Maulana yang membantu kami membawakan barang bawaan sangat baik dan sopan, dia membuat saya merasa lebih baik dan yakin ada harapan untuk mendapatkan pengalaman menginap yang menyenangkan di sini. Ya, saya masih menginap di sini sampai hari Minggu, semoga saya mendapatkan pengalaman menginap yang benar-benar menyenangkan."
"431.","Nayeon Kim","5","2023-01-21","1","Saya ragu karena ratingnya rendah di Agoda dan Booking.com, tapi saya percaya rating Google Maps dan akhirnya memutuskan untuk menginap di sini... Resepsionisnya mengecewakan sejak awal. Rasanya seperti kamar goshiwon (rumah kos). Saya sarankan untuk mengeluarkan lebih banyak uang dan mencari tempat yang lebih baik. Malah, hotel tempat saya menginap seharga 60.000 won jauh lebih baik. Hanya lobinya saja yang bagus."
"432.","Roberto Gondrong","81","2022-01-21","1","Saya pernah ke hotel ini beberapa tahun yang lalu, ketika namanya masih Nikko. Hotel ini sangat bagus dengan layanan bintang lima. Pullman justru sebaliknya. 1. Proses check-in-nya sangat buruk, konter check-in lambat, satu pelanggan membutuhkan waktu 30 menit, antreannya panjang. Apakah ini hotel atau pusat berbagi Corona? Restoran dengan daftar tunggu, mereka menempatkan petugas di pintu masuk, mencatat nama dan nomor ponsel pelanggan, dan menelepon mereka ketika giliran mereka tiba. Atau, jika tidak memungkinkan, setidaknya berikan nomor telepon pelanggan agar kami (50 orang) tidak perlu menunggu bersama! Saya sudah menghubungi manajer, tidak ada yang datang. Saya sudah menelepon hotel, tidak ada yang menjawab dari kantor manajemen. Pemerintah seharusnya segera menutup operasional hotel ini! 2. Saya memesan kamar superior premium bebas rokok yang seharusnya memiliki pemandangan kota, tetapi diberi kamar merokok yang memiliki pemandangan atap gudang. Kamar itu berada di lantai paling bawah hotel. Akhirnya saya membayar lebih, ditipu, dan menginap di kamar yang bau. Malam yang buruk! 3. Selama pandemi, Anda harus memilih waktu sarapan; JANGAN pilih jam paling awal karena tidak ada yang siap, hampir semua juru masak masih tidur. Saya meminta keju dan mereka menyajikan keju pizza parut... Mereka bahkan tidak tahu keju mana yang untuk dimakan dan mana yang untuk dimasak. 4. Masalah lain dari hotel ini adalah tempat parkirnya. Jika Anda datang dengan mobil sendiri, sebagai informasi, tempat parkir mobil berada di gedung lain, yang berjarak lebih dari 500 meter dari pintu masuk. Ada jembatan penghubung antara tempat parkir mobil dan hotel, tetapi ditutup antara pukul 22.00 hingga 10.00. Jadi, jika Anda harus check-out lebih awal (pukul 09.00) dan jika hujan di luar, harap Anda membawa payung tadi malam. Jika tidak, pilihlah antara meninggalkan mobil di sini atau berjalan di bawah hujan sejauh setengah km. Kesimpulan: selama pandemi, semua orang mengalami masa-masa sulit menghasilkan uang, terutama bisnis pariwisata dan perhotelan. Sungguh luar biasa dan memalukan sebuah hotel melayani pelanggan mereka dengan sangat buruk selama periode ini. Pemilik hotel ini harus membaca ulasan ini dan mengambil tindakan sebelum terlambat. Kalau Anda memperlakukan pelanggan seperti ini selama pandemi, saya tidak bisa membayangkan bagaimana jadinya di masa normal. Pelayanan dan karyawannya bahkan tidak pantas mendapat bintang 1, apalagi manajer hotelnya yang bahkan tidak berani menghadapi masalah pelanggan, atau bahkan tidak meminta maaf. Itu harga terendah yang bisa saya berikan."
"433.","Sugiarto Sugiarto","87","2022-01-21","1","Pengalaman Buruk... Itu pengalaman pertama saya menginap di Pullman, Thamrin, Jakarta. Saya memesan kamar melalui agen perjalanan, dan ketika check-in, saya diberitahu oleh resepsionis bahwa kamar tidak tersedia. Setelah berdiskusi, kami mencapai solusi. Saya menunjukkan surat pemesanan di ponsel saya, dan oleh staf resepsionis, ponsel saya diambil tanpa izin dan dikembalikan begitu saja ke meja. Kamar tidak memiliki perlengkapan standar, hanya 1 handuk, 1 sikat gigi. Setelah menunggu 1 jam dan bertanya 2 kali, barang yang diberikan salah. Keesokan harinya, saya meminta piring dan alat makan, tetapi setelah 1,5 jam dan 3 kali permintaan, piring dan alat makan tidak datang. Gedung parkir sangat gelap, karena tidak ada lampu sama sekali dan tidak ada petugas keamanan di sekitar."

"435.","Nanang Suwandi","1","2022-01-21","1","Bapak Dan Benzaquensir yang terhormat, Saya kecewa dengan isi dan nada balasan Anda atas keluhan saya tentang perlakuan di hotel Anda. Rasanya seperti membaca template yang sudah disiapkan. Bukan sentuhan pribadi. Pertama, saya pernah bekerja di hotel-hotel di seluruh dunia, terakhir di Sofitel London St James bintang 5. Jadi saya tahu bagaimana seharusnya hotel yang baik dikelola. Saya punya rekan manajemen di beberapa hotel di Indonesia yang meyakinkan saya bahwa tidak melanggar hukum untuk mengizinkan pengiriman barang yang telah disanitasi dengan benar kepada tamu yang dikarantina. Apakah Anda berharap saya percaya bahwa semua makanan, barang, dan perlengkapan, serta staf, hanya dipasok dari dalam hotel? Itu omong kosong. Staf membawa makanan dan kebutuhan pokok lainnya ke hotel setiap hari. Makanan diantar dari luar ke dapur. Apa bedanya? Saya telah mencoba menghubungi Manajer Kantor Depan hotel beberapa kali untuk menghindari eskalasi ke tingkat yang lebih tinggi, tetapi beliau menghindari menghubungi saya, yang menambah tingkat stres dan kecemasan saya yang tinggi. Saya telah mengalami tingkat kebersihan yang rendah karena perlengkapan mandi saya tidak diantar tanpa alasan apa pun. Saya akan menghindari hotel ini di masa mendatang dan menyarankan teman serta kolega untuk melakukan hal yang sama. Prioritas saya di akhir masa inap yang penuh tekanan dan tidak menyenangkan ini adalah naik taksi dan menginap di tempat lain. Staf Anda tidak memiliki inisiatif, kasih sayang, empati, profesionalisme, atau kemauan untuk membantu atau memberikan layanan ekstra untuk tamu, dan yang saya inginkan hanyalah perlengkapan mandi kali ini. Saya telah menginap di hotel ini lebih dari dua kali sebelumnya dan kali ini saya merasa sangat trauma berurusan dengan staf Anda. Tidak ada budaya di sini untuk mengantisipasi kebutuhan tamu dan berusaha memenuhi harapan mereka. Gagasan bahwa ini adalah hotel bintang 5 menghina sebuah hotel yang dikelola dengan baik."
"436.","harnsiri sangwongkit","4","2024-01-21","1","Sistem manajemennya buruk. 1. Proses check-in sangat lama, hampir 30 menit. 2. Kamar masih belum tersedia hingga pukul 15.00.

"437.","KHALISHA ADELIA AZIZA","7","2022-01-21","1","Sayangnya, saya punya pengalaman buruk di sini. Saya memesan melalui telepon malam sebelum kedatangan. Saya ingin mentransfer pembayaran, tetapi karyawannya menolak dan meminta saya membayar saat kedatangan. Dia hanya menanyakan nama dan nomor ponsel saya. Keesokan harinya, tidak ada reservasi atas nama saya. Jadi saya harus menunggu hampir 2 jam untuk check-in. Kamar mandinya bocor, dan saya memesan untuk 4 orang, tetapi setiap kamar hanya mendapatkan SATU handuk. Bagi saya, ini sangat merepotkan. Tidak direkomendasikan."
"438.","Lydia Napitupulu","51","2022-01-21","1","Saya menyelenggarakan acara di sana. Hotelnya mengubah kamar yang Anda pesan meskipun Anda sudah membayar 50% (kontrak mengizinkan mereka melakukannya - meskipun alasannya adalah untuk memberikan kamar tersebut kepada acara lain). Selain itu, di Pullman, Anda tidak bisa memilih makanan yang disajikan di acara Anda - hotel yang memutuskan dan mereka sangat menolak saran. Jika Anda tahu apa yang disukai tamu Anda, sangat sulit untuk berada di posisi di mana Anda tidak bisa menyediakannya. Dan Anda akhirnya punya banyak sisa makanan. Ada kekecewaan lain, terlalu panjang untuk ditulis. Dulu semuanya lebih baik, tetapi sekarang saya menempatkan mereka dalam kategori produk tersebut dengan Lion Air."
"439.","Richard Irving","151","2022-01-21","1","Hotel bintang 5 dengan pengalaman bintang 2... Terakhir kali saya ke sini, ada masalah dengan AC. Berbulan-bulan kemudian, AC-nya masih belum diperbaiki. Liftnya panas dan berkeringat, koridornya panas dan lembap, dan kamarnya tidak sejuk, jadi tidak nyaman untuk tidur. Akhirnya saya pindah ke sayap lain tempat AC berfungsi. Area sarapan keesokan paginya panas dan berkeringat, tidak nyaman, dan banyak nyamuk, begitu pula di dalam kamar. Saya hampir tidak bisa tidur karena digigit beberapa kali sepanjang malam. Keesokan harinya, ada acara pernikahan di lantai bawah dan hanya ada satu lift yang beroperasi. Harus menunggu lebih dari 15 menit untuk kembali ke kamar karena para tamu pernikahan memenuhi satu-satunya lift yang tersisa dengan bantuan staf di lantai 3. Jika ini hotel biasa, saya tidak akan terlalu terganggu, tetapi ini memang seharusnya hotel bintang 5, bahkan Pullman sekalipun. Standarnya jauh di bawah standar Pullman atau hotel Accor mana pun, dan saya sangat terkejut bahwa hotel yang berlokasi strategis seperti ini justru dioperasikan dengan sangat buruk. Saya tidak akan menginap di sini lagi. Diturunkan dari 2 bintang menjadi 1 bintang. Orang-orang ini benar-benar payah. Setelah semalaman tidak bisa tidur karena kamar penuh nyamuk, saya minta kamar saya disemprot. Saya pulang malam ini, melihat nyamuk-nyamuk beterbangan. Saya minta disemprot untuk mengusirnya sendiri. 30 menit dan sekarang sudah 3 kali telepon ke resepsionis. Saya masih duduk di sini menunggu tanpa semprotan. Susah sekali membawa nyamuk ke kamar!? Pengalaman yang benar-benar buruk. Hindari hotel ini, banyak pilihan yang lebih baik di area ini."

Customer service & resepsionis di bawah tidak efektif untuk membantu. Proses check-in menghabiskan setengah jam sendiri. Dan ternyata dari sisi fasilitas, hotel ini masih tergolong jadul..

Untuk hotel sekelas Pullman, ini sangat mengecewakan sekali karena kamu dari luar kota dan membawa Bayi yang sudah rewel. Kamar cukup cozy, sarapan cukup bervariasi tetapi soal rasa tidak istimewa (ekspektasi saya untuk hotel bintang 5 seharusnya lebih baik) Lokasi cukup strategis karena berada diseberang PI dan sangat dekat dengan stasiun MRT. Apakah saya akan kembali menginap ? Mungkin saya akan pikir pikir lagi karena momen staycation saya jadi mengecewakan karena issue Check In."
"555.","Evita Purnamasari","9","2022-01-21","2","Worst stay ever in five star hotel. Kami booking 6 kamar untuk kebutuhan wedding. Sudah booking h-1,5 bulan dan langsung telfon untuk rikues bantuan untuk di arrange agar 6 kamar bisa 1 lantai bejejer. Kenapa haru selantai? karena untuk memudahkan mobilisasi MUA dan wedding organizer. Di telfon, petugas bilang oke akan dibantu. H-1 bulan kami sengaja datang langsung ke pullman untuk make sure lagi kalau rikues kita bisa 'diperjuangkan' sambil setengah memohon. Dan sekali lagi petugas bilang iya. Hari H jam 07.00 (6 jam sebelum jam check in loh, sengaja jauh-jauh dari bekasi demi biar kita bisa firm dapet selantai) petugas defensive dan bilang tidak bisa tanpa come up sama solusi. Petugas yang bernama ALDI pun menjawab dengan tidak sopan layaknya petugas hotel bintang 5. Akhirnya dia lunak dan mau bantu pas kita bilang duit bukan masalah buat kita. Aneh sekali, mungkin emang kita bukan pesen kamar paling mahal. Baju kita juga bukan branded. Tapi sorry ya Mas Aldi, duit kita juga banyak kok :) Pas abis check in pesen in room food datangnya juga LAMA SEKALI karena ada miskoordinasi antar petugas hotel. Call untuk rikues sejadah juga butuh 3x nelfon dan 1 jam baru datang ke kamar. Saya mau pinjem gunting juga harus nelfon 3 nomor yg berbeda dan akhirnya gak datang juga itu gunting. Input data plat nomor mobil juga SALAHHHHHHH dan saya di charge parkir mahal sekali. Manager hotel sempet telfon ke kamar untuk minta maaf dan minta saya untuk delete Bad Review tanpa memberikan kompensasi apapun sampai saya check out. Oke lah maaf, tapi kesalahan management hotel udah BANYAK SEKALI. So, I have to say, baru ini nginep di Pullman sekecewa ini. Management nya buruk s.e.k.a.l.i. Won't ever want to stay here AGAIN."

Jendela tidak kedap suara, terdengar suara motor dan mobil balap sepanjang malam. Kamarnya TUA, dengan kamar mandi berdinding kaca.

Sayangnya, tidak ada kamar yang tersedia, jadi kami harus menunggu hingga pukul 17.00—membuat kami terlambat untuk pertunjukan. Keterlambatan ini bermula dari perselisihan antara tim housekeeping dan resepsionis. Resepsionis telah berusaha sebaik mungkin untuk menyelesaikannya, tetapi kebijakan standarnya jelas: tamu harus check-out sebelum pukul 12.00 agar check-in setelah pukul 15.00 dapat dilakukan. Semua orang harus mematuhi aturan ini. Hal aneh lainnya: setiap mobil yang memasuki area hotel untuk menjemput tamu dikenakan biaya parkir, bahkan untuk pengantaran atau penjemputan cepat—yang rasanya tidak masuk akal."

"589.","Nikhil Pendse","63","2024-01-21","2","Hotel yang sangat biasa saja. Tidak sesuai dengan nama mereknya. Kamar-kamarnya sangat mengecewakan dengan pelapis jok yang usang, karpet bernoda, dan perlengkapan serta perlengkapan toilet yang usang. Meskipun harganya setara dengan beberapa merek ternama lain di sekitar Jln Thamrin, hotel ini mungkin cepat ketinggalan zaman. Terlepas dari lokasinya dan lobi yang dirancang dengan baik, saya tidak terkesan sama sekali ketika memasuki kamar. Hotel ini memang perlu direnovasi."
"590.","M B","47","2023-01-21","2","Saya dan istri saya mengalami pengalaman menginap yang agak meragukan di hotel ini. Kami tiba agak larut malam dan tidak memesan kamar terlebih dahulu. Kami mendapat kamar dan diberitahu harga untuk menginap kami akan menjadi Rp6 juta. Setelah check-out, kami diberitahu bahwa mereka melakukan kesalahan dan perlu menaikkan harga menjadi Rp9 juta. Tidak ada yang memberi tahu kami sebelumnya, tidak ada informasi apa pun. Sejujurnya saya merasa sedikit tertipu. Jika Anda menginap di hotel ini, pesanlah terlebih dahulu. Selama menginap, sebagian besar baik-baik saja. Sarapannya luar biasa. Berbagai makanan dari Korea, Jepang, Cina, Indonesia, dan beberapa makanan bergaya Eropa juga. Stafnya selalu ramah. Seorang wanita dari staf bahkan memberi tahu kami bahwa kami bisa mendapatkan minuman gratis setelah sarapan, kami hanya perlu meminta. Jadi kami melakukannya dan tidak ada minuman untuk kami karena perlu voucher. Hal ini tidak disebutkan oleh wanita itu dan itu agak mengecewakan tetapi tidak masalah. Layanan kamar di bawah rata-rata, suatu malam kami memesan steak medium dengan saus lada dan beberapa pasta. Yang kami dapatkan adalah steak matang dengan saus jamur. Makanannya memang tampak enak, tapi sudah setengah dingin dan sangat hambar. Sangat sangat tidak memuaskan. Secara keseluruhan, saya berharap bisa memberi nilai lebih tinggi, tetapi proses check-in-nya sangat tidak menyenangkan dan hal itu seharusnya tidak terjadi di hotel bintang 5."
"591.","TX Shi","65","2019-01-21","2","Saya mengunjungi spa dan pusat kebugaran hari ini. Fasilitasnya sangat bagus. Semua orang yang bekerja di sana ramah, kecuali seorang wanita yang bekerja sekitar pukul 19.00. Dia bekerja di bagian resepsionis dekat spa dan kebugaran. Wajahnya membuat saya merasa seperti memiliki jutaan dolar miliknya. Sungguh buruknya pelayanan di hotel sebagus ini. Saya berencana untuk menginap di sana lagi setelah kembali dari kota-kota lain di Indonesia. Sekarang saya harus memikirkannya lagi karena saya cukup kecewa dengan pengalaman buruk itu."
"592.","Maggie Patterson","2","2018-01-21","2","Saya sudah sering menginap di sana, kamar grand deluxe, dan kali ini saya benar-benar kecewa. Air panas di bilik pancuran dan wastafel sama sekali tidak panas. Rasa sarapannya menurun dan para pelayan bersikap tidak menyenangkan kepada saya karena saya mengeluh tentang layanan yang mereka berikan. Dia membawa saya berkeliling untuk menemukan meja yang seharusnya bisa langsung mengantar tamu ke meja di restoran hotel bintang 5 yang layak. Wanita di konter lontong sayur tidak memakai sarung tangan untuk tujuan kebersihan ketika dia memotong lontong saya dan menaruhnya di piring saya. Dan hal besar yang benar-benar membuat saya kesal adalah ketika teman saya meminta kantong kertas untuk mengambil kue kering yang tidak bisa dia habiskan dan salah satu pelayan bertanya kepada manajer dan saya mendengar manajer bertanya kepada pelayan apakah mereka (saya dan teman) membayar sarapannya. Dia pikir kita ini apa? Apakah menurutmu kita bisa duduk dan sarapan gratis? Kalau tidak, manajer tidak bisa membayar sikat giginya dari gaji, kan? Saya cuma heran, kok bisa orang itu diangkat jadi manajer, padahal dia nggak punya otak untuk mikirin omongannya? Perlu review tentang karyawan Anda, dan yang pasti saya nggak akan balik lagi dan merekomendasikan hotel Anda ke siapa pun seperti yang saya lakukan sebelumnya!"
"593.","Benjamin Tanone","14","2023-01-21","2","Kami mencoba membayar di muka untuk pemesanan kami (karena pemesanan massal, 6-7 kamar), dan operator telepon terus mengatakan, Kami akan segera mengirimkan konfirmasinya. Setelah 3 hari berturut-turut dihubungi dan tidak ada balasan email, kami terpaksa menunggu selama 20 menit karena seorang wanita malang harus mengetik email yang penuh kesalahan di tempat. Tahukah Anda bahwa hotel bintang 5 dapat membatasi jumlah isi ulang botol air per hari hingga 3, bahkan ketika kami sedang bersama bayi? Bahkan hotel bintang 4 tempat saya menginap memiliki isi ulang tanpa batas, jadi saya benar-benar tidak tahu apa yang terjadi dengan manajemen hotel. Sepertinya pandemi telah menghantam mereka dengan keras, dan mereka berusaha memangkas biaya di mana-mana. Selain itu, kamarnya sangat tua dan menunjukkan tanda-tanda kurangnya perawatan. Tidak ada dekorasi sama sekali. Selain itu, sarapan tampaknya tidak dapat diantar ke kamar, terlepas dari apa yang dikatakan staf reservasi Pullman ketika kami mencoba memesan. Untungnya, tempat tidurnya termasuk yang ternyaman yang pernah saya tiduri di hotel, jadi itu menyenangkan. Dan hotelnya juga punya galeri seni yang keren banget."

"595.","亀田義晴","1","2018-01-21","2","Ini kunjungan kedua saya, setelah kunjungan pertama saya pada Mei 2014. Menu sarapannya beragam dan lezat, fasilitas hotelnya sempurna, dan kamarnya sangat bersih. Seharusnya saya memberikan ulasan yang sangat positif, tapi... Saat itu Jumat malam, 11 Agustus. Ketika saya kembali ke kamar malam itu, saya mendengar musik yang sangat keras. Kedengarannya seperti ada disko di dekat sini. Apakah ada pesta atau acara seperti disko yang sedang berlangsung di dalam hotel? Teman saya, yang menginap di lantai atas, juga mengatakan bahwa hotel itu sangat bising. Jika ada acara yang sedang berlangsung di dalam hotel, saya sangat ingin mereka menghentikannya."
"596.","Oesman Suryata","25","2022-01-21","2","Proses Check-in yang Buruk Membayangkan staycation yang menyenangkan selama libur panjang Idul Fitri, saya malah membuang-buang waktu sore hanya untuk menunggu kamar siap. Proses check-innya sendiri buruk, pelayanannya sangat lambat, butuh 20-30 menit untuk menunggu. Resepsionis bilang saya harus menunggu satu jam lagi sampai kamar siap. Meskipun saya sudah check-in online, dia masih menanyakan 'kamar bebas asap rokok atau merokok, tempat tidur besar atau twin' dan meminta pembayaran jaminan. Totalnya, saya harus menunggu lebih dari 2 jam untuk kamar saya siap. Sesampainya di kamar, saya masih terkejut, ada seseorang di kamar yang masih melakukan pemeriksaan akhir. Sepertinya sebagian besar tamu kesal dengan proses check-in yang lambat. Kamarnya tidak terlalu luas dan tidak ada mesin kopi, melainkan ketel yang sudah ketinggalan zaman. TV layar kecil dan Wi-Fi-nya lambat, meskipun sebagai anggota Platinum, saya diberi kode akses premium. Pemandangan dari kamar saya bagus, menghadap Jalan Thamrin dengan pemandangan hotel dan pusat perbelanjaan, tetapi itu harus dibayar dengan kebisingan lalu lintas di malam hari. Tidak ada handuk di kamar mandi, untungnya kami membawa handuk sendiri dari rumah. Kami menikmati hidangan Social Hours di Restoran Sana Sini. Stafnya ramah. Secara keseluruhan, pengalaman menginap ini sama sekali tidak menyenangkan."
"597.","Anggre Smith","69","2023-01-21","2","Kami menginap semalam saat transit di Jakarta. Kami mengatur alokasi dan permintaan kamar beberapa bulan sebelum kedatangan, yang disetujui pihak hotel dengan biaya tambahan. Kamar kami sangat ketinggalan jaman, berbau apek, dan fasilitas kamarnya sudah tua, beberapa di antaranya benar-benar rusak. Sangat kecewa untuk ukuran hotel bintang 5, kami memutuskan untuk membatalkan pemesanan yang akan datang untuk sisa masa inap kami."
"598.","Atlal LAOUAR","11","2016-01-21","2","Restorannya luar biasa. Stafnya sangat ramah dan hotelnya aman. Namun, kamar-kamarnya berbau jamur/lembab/fungus yang sangat menyengat. Saya menginap di kamar yang telah direnovasi dan baunya sungguh tak tertahankan. Di meja resepsionis, hotel ini menggunakan parfum yang membuat mata berair, hidung gatal... Pada dasarnya Anda tidak pernah menghirup hanya udara. Hal ini bukan karakteristik hotel ini, melainkan di semua tempat yang lembap. Jaringan hotel besar ini seharusnya menyesuaikan konstruksi mereka dengan iklim. Tidak perlu ada karpet di kamar-kamar di negara-negara yang hangat dan lembap seperti itu. Itu satu hal, solusi lainnya bisa jadi menggunakan mesin Ozon yang memurnikan udara. Rupanya mesin ini ada di Asia. Sebenarnya bukan untuk promosi apa pun. Saya berbicara sebagai klien dan mencoba mencari solusi agar tamu saya merasa nyaman di hotel-hotel Asia."

"600.","Yoon","95","2020-01-21","2","Saya memesan hotel ini untuk Natal karena mereka bilang sarapannya lezat. Namun, meskipun sarapan prasmanannya banyak pilihan, rasanya tidak terlalu enak dan membuat saya merasa kenyang. Saya skeptis dengan ulasan orang-orang yang mengatakan sarapannya lezat. Saya sengaja memesan hotel ini untuk mencoba sarapan prasmanannya, tetapi saya tidak merekomendasikannya. Namun, prasmanan makan siangnya sepertinya menyajikan lobster dan kerang. Lebih baik saya pergi makan siang saja daripada menginap di sana. Kolam renangnya kecil, dan kamarnya juga kecil. Gedung ini dihuni di semua 11 lantai, jadi pemandangannya kurang bagus. Karena ulang tahun saya bertepatan dengan Natal, saya meminta dekorasi ulang tahun, tetapi mereka hanya menyediakan dekorasi Natal. Meskipun hotelnya tidak penuh, tidak ada peningkatan kamar. Satu-satunya kelebihannya adalah Grand Indonesia Plaza Indonesia berada tepat di seberang jalan, sehingga mudah diakses."
"601.","Kai Leong Kwang","38","2018-01-21","2","Tidak sebaik yang seharusnya. Tekanan air di kamar mandi rendah. Salah satu colokan listrik tidak berfungsi, lampu samping tempat tidur tidak menyala.

"603.","Gloria Elleanor","6","2023-01-21","2","Ketika saya menginap di hotel, baik hotel bintang 3 maupun bintang 5, saya selalu meluangkan waktu untuk berlari di treadmill di pusat kebugaran hotel (itulah mengapa saya lebih suka menginap di hotel yang memiliki pusat kebugaran yang buka 24 jam). Hari ini, tanggal 23 Juli, saya menginap di hotel bintang 5 Pullman Jakarta. Saya dan suami check-in terlambat sekitar pukul 17.30, dan hal pertama yang saya tanyakan kepada petugas yang memeriksa kami adalah, Sampai jam berapa pusat kebugaran buka dan bolehkah saya menggunakan pusat kebugaran agak malam ini? karena saya seorang pelari dan saya tidak boleh melewatkan latihan saya. Lalu petugas itu berkata, Pusat kebugaran kami buka 24 jam, tetapi setelah jam 9 tidak akan ada staf yang siaga di sana. Lalu saya berkata, Tidak apa-apa, saya hanya perlu treadmill dengan AC menyala. Jadi, berdasarkan apa yang dikatakan petugas resepsionis, saya berasumsi bahwa saya masih bisa pergi ke pusat kebugaran untuk berlatih malam ini. Nah, sekitar pukul 22.15 saya pergi ke pusat kebugaran dan ada dua petugas keamanan yang bertugas di sebelah pusat kebugaran dan mengatakan bahwa pusat kebugaran tersebut tutup. Saya memberi tahu mereka bahwa saya telah memberi tahu staf kantor depan bahwa saya akan menggunakan treadmill di pusat kebugaran agak larut malam dan petugas keamanan menelepon, saya tidak tahu departemen mana. Tak lama kemudian, petugas keamanan menerima telepon dari manajer jaga, Ibu D, dan saya telah berbicara dengannya dan menjelaskan, dan dia bertanya kepada saya siapa yang memeriksa saya sebelumnya dan sebagainya, dan saya harus menunggu sekitar 20 menit total sampai mereka akhirnya mengizinkan saya masuk (?). Masalahnya, di depan pusat kebugaran ada stiker yang dengan jelas menyatakan bahwa pusat kebugaran buka selama 24 jam dan untuk penggunaan setelah pukul 23.00, silakan hubungi manajer jaga. Saya tidak dapat membayangkan hotel bintang 5 bisa memiliki layanan tamu yang buruk dan komunikasi yang buruk seperti hotel bintang 2. Salut untuk petugas yang memeriksa saya karena dia sangat memahami hotel ini. Hanya saja, gym-nya tidak buka 24 jam, jadi saya sangat kecewa. Ini pertama kalinya saya menginap di Pullman Jakarta, tetapi saya sudah pernah menginap di banyak hotel bintang 5 di dunia. Namun, untuk urusan gym, Pullman Jakarta tidak memenuhi harapan saya tentang bagaimana sebuah hotel bintang 5 seharusnya memberikan layanan terbaik kepada tamunya. Semoga pengalaman saya ini menjadi pelajaran berharga untuk menghindari kekecewaan dan berusaha memberikan kepuasan kepada tamu-tamu Anda di masa mendatang."

Saya membayar menggunakan Mandiri Debit di EDC BRI dan akun saya berhasil didebet, tetapi info kasir dari mesin EDC belum berhasil. Jadi saya diminta lagi untuk bertransaksi, dan saya memilih menggunakan ATM BCA di EDC BCA dan berhasil. Dijanjikan oleh kasir uang saya akan kembali dalam 1x24 jam. Pada tanggal 27 Desember saya menghubungi pihak hotel lagi, karena uang saya belum dikembalikan. Dia mengatakan bahwa dia akan segera menindaklanjuti ke bagian keuangan dan pihak keuangan akan segera menghubungi saya. Tetapi sampai tanggal 30 Desember, tidak ada seorang pun dari Pullman yang menghubungi saya. Saya menelepon kembali ke pihak Pullman, ternyata hal ini baru akan ditindaklanjuti ke bagian keuangan hari ini. Sangat mengecewakan sebagai kelas bintang 5 seperti Pullman, cara menangani komplain pelanggan sangat buruk!"

"609.","킹글","103","2023-01-21","2","Saya tidak merekomendasikannya. Kamar hotelnya biasa saja, interiornya biasa saja, dan jalan-jalan di sekitarnya sedang dalam perbaikan.

"627.","D. Nadya","12","2026-01-17","2","Pengalaman menginap di Pullman Thamrin sangat tidak menyenangkan. Pertama, petugas resepsionis mereka kurang berempati. Kami melakukan perjalanan seharian dari Solo ke Gambir, hampir 8 jam. Tentu saja kami butuh istirahat segera. Sayangnya, kami mengalami masalah dengan bak mandi, mereka tidak dapat memperbaikinya sehingga mereka menawarkan untuk pindah ke kamar lain. Mereka hanya butuh 5-10 menit, tetapi ternyata lebih lama. Saya menelepon staf mereka lagi untuk menanyakan perkembangannya karena anak saya benar-benar butuh istirahat. Mereka tidak bisa memberi tahu saya berapa lama saya harus menunggu, dan saat saya berbicara, mereka langsung memotong pembicaraan! Dan saya seperti, wow, saya tidak bisa berkata apa-apa. Setelah kami pindah ke kamar lain, seprai mereka berbau apak. Yah, saya sudah tidak punya energi lagi untuk mengeluh, jadi saya tidur selama 2 malam dengan bau itu 🙃 Kedua, saya memesan melalui OTA dan sudah menambahkan catatan khusus bahwa Saya ingin merayakan ulang tahun suami saya, mohon siapkan kamar. Yah, mereka juga tidak pandai menata kamar, ini bukan pertama kalinya saya menginap di Pullman, tapi kurasa ini terakhir kalinya saya memilih Pullman Thamrin. Saya hanya jujur ​​saat menulis ulasan ini."
