"1.","Benaya Christo","13","2025-12-01","5","We just had our wedding at Raffles Hotel Jakarta, and our experience was perfect! Choosing a wedding venue was a big decision for us. We are very glad that from the beginning, Shella, our wedding sales rep from Raffles Jakarta has made every effort to ensure our journey was as smooth sailing as possible. From arranging room tours, to showing us the ballroom layout, hosting our food tasting and tech meet, right until the big day and the day after, Shella and team have always made us feel welcomed. Our rooms were meticulously prepared and and thoroughly cleaned. The check in and checkout process was smooth and the hotel staff were beyond helpful in helping us unload and load our luggages. We also enjoyed the spa treatment and swimming pool facility that helped us relax and rest the day after. The food was top notch. We especially loved the black pepper beef and the coconut pudding from Chef Aryo, and we heard great things from our guests as well, so kudos to the Chef and team! The location of the hotel is very strategic. It is right next to a big mall (Lotte / Ciputra World), so it was very easy to get any small items we might have missed next door, and we were also able to easily find options for shopping and meals. There is also a SilverBird pool right outside, which made it convenient for us to transport our luggages and things after we checked out. There were also ample parking space for us, our vendors and our guests. The hotel is also next to two service apartments (Ascott and Somerset Grand Citra), so it was very convenient for visiting family and friends as they have a lot of accommodation options to choose from. Overall my wife and I are very glad that we chose Raffles Jakarta to be our wedding venue. We had the most wonderful experience, and can't wait for our next visit to Raffles Jakarta!"

The hotel team provided great help with the arrangements, ensuring everything went perfectly. Whether we were having breakfast at the Arts Café or drinks at The Writers Bar, the staff were always attentive and took excellent care of us. If you are a fan of cakes, you must try the desserts there! We will definitely stay at this hotel again on our next visit to Jakarta."
"3.","Angelique Kezia Chandra","3","2025-12-25","5","We had an amazing time here. I greatly recommend to stay in this place, especially to eat in the Arts Cafe. We went to the different themed buffet dinners on Thursday and Friday. The breakfast is also so worth it. Not only is food amazing here, the service is also great. We were served by multiple very nice and welcoming people: Jojo, Gio, Kevin, and Danielle."
"4.","Nancy LS","44","2025-12-01","5","Amazing experience! The best luxury hotel I've stayed at yet. Our room (King Room with Garden view) was so big and luxurious - big bed, spacious bathroom, dual sinks, which made it a perfect sanctuary after a getaway. Small gestures like chocolates and fruit made us feel so special. Food at Arts Cafe was so delicious - a rotating a la carte menu in addition to the buffet gave us many options and ensured that the food was fresh. The hotel facilities were good - the gym had great equipment, the pool was large enough to do laps, and there is a walking track that makes you feel like you are a garden oasis. The hotel is connected to a mall, which is so convenient. The mall has a supermarket (Ranch) on the lower ground floor and a plethora of other entertainment and dining options, which gave us great options when we wanted to venture outside the hotel but not battle the Jakarta traffic. And the hospitality of the staff were second to none. Very attentive without being overbearing. Friendly, helpful and discreet. We felt like we were in complete privacy, but if we needed their attention and support, they were very responsive. The special attention given to you sets the Raffles apart from other luxury hotels, which is why I would particularly recommend the Raffles for a staycation or holiday. Just go and see for yourself - you won't forget the experience! Thank you to the team for making our experience one we will never forget."
"5.","Yoshinori Kajitani","84","2025-12-11","4","I recently stayed at Raffles Jakarta and was initially impressed by the hotel’s reputation and elegant atmosphere. Excellent pre-arrival communication and an impressive upgrade to a beautiful suite made my stay memorable, and the hotel features refined spaces and a stunning bar that perfectly reflect the Raffles brand. However, the Raffles Lounge did not meet this standard. Even basic items such as cutlery and napkins were not provided unless requested, and staff did not react even when I was already eating bread. As a result, it felt as if guests were expected to manage everything themselves. The buffet selection was also quite limited, and the à la carte dishes took a long time to arrive. Because the Raffles brand is known for attention to detail and effortless service, this gap was noticeable. With improvements to the lounge service, the hotel has the potential to deliver the flawless experience its name promises."
"6.","Sheerwan O'Shea-Nejad","38","2025-12-01","5","I had the amazing stay at Raffles Jakarta for my partner's birthday. The room's are large, well designed and well lit and we were given an upgrade. The service was extraordinary from check in till departure (even being offered a drink at departure). Head Butler Fachrul's team were phenomenal, with them both catering to our every request and surprising us with their own ideas (thank you Brilliant at Arts Cafe, living up to your name). The staff at Arts Cafe were extraordinary too, thank you Danielle for making it such a memorable birthday. We only visited Writer's Bar once but it was equally fun. We can't wait to visit again."
"7.","Max Moore","23","2025-12-01","5","Very nice Hotel. Staff is very friendly and helps you whenever you need them. The rooms are very big. I got upgraded as an Accor Platinum to a suite. Very kind. Also you get access to the amazing club lounge which has a la cart + buffet and cocktails in the evening. The food tastes good. It was a very pleasant stay. Only criticism I have is that noise sensitive people should book only the garden view rooms cause the front of the Hotel is facing a highway and the noise isolation is not top notch."
"8.","Edy Susilo","7","2025-12-27","5","It was a business trip stay. The hotel is located near the Jakarta office hence it it quite convince as I can walk to the office building. The traffic in front of the hotel was very bad as it always jam. The hotel is connected to Lotte Mall at the first floor. So it is quite convince to dine and shop without a needed to be trapped in Jakarta notorious traffic jam. The team is very friendly and will try their best to fullfil the guest request. Thumbs up especially to the concierge team. The lounge can be busy at particular time with table availability may be quite challenging. I end up having my seat on the sofa through out my stay. Breakfast spread is a bit disappointing. It is lesser Buffett option with quite some ala cart menu which only change on weekly basis. The dimsum is quite sub-par in my opinion. I hope there is more traditional Indonesian dessert (jajanan pasar) options available Recommended this hotel especially when you have business around that area."
"9.","Melati Putri D","22","2025-12-01","5","I had a wonderful stay at Raffles Jakarta. The hotel room was spacious and very comfortable, with a beautifully designed interior — from the living area to the bedroom and bathroom, everything felt elegant and thoughtfully arranged. The view of Jakarta’s city skyline and the hotel’s clean, well-kept garden was truly impressive. The hotel offers great facilities such as a gym, fitness classes, and a lovely swimming pool. Breakfast was excellent, with a wide variety of choices — from Western dishes to traditional Indonesian food. What stood out the most was the outstanding service. I had several suitcases and shopping bags, and the staff kindly helped me carry all of them with genuine care and friendliness. Thank you so much to the Raffles Jakarta team for such a wonderful experience. I’ll definitely stay here again on my next trip to Jakarta! 💛"
"10.","Sean Jung","4","2025-12-01","5","I recently stayed at Raffles Jakarta for five nights and was thoroughly impressed by the overall service and hospitality. The staff consistently demonstrated warmth and professionalism, making the experience both comfortable and memorable. One highlight of my stay was the breakfast service. The quality and variety were excellent, and the atmosphere was welcoming each morning. I would especially like to recognize Danielle, who was attentive and kind throughout my visits to the breakfast area. Her thoughtful service added a personal touch that made each day start on a positive note. Overall, Raffles Jakarta delivered an exceptional experience, combining luxury with genuine hospitality. I look forward to returning in the future."
"11.","Weronika Rudy","1","2025-12-01","5","We decided to stay at the Raffles Jakarta to celebrate my 30th birthday and it was truly exceptional. The staff were absolutely lovely and attentive. I was surprised with balloons and a complimentary cake which made the stay feel special from the start. The rooms were spacious, luxurious and immaculate. And the breakfast deserves a special mention, as foodies we greatly enjoyed the vast amount of choice and the best ingredients they used, they served the best oat cappuccino we've ever had and our favourite was the special souffle pancake. I would highly recommend Raffles to anyone who wants to experience a bit of luxury!"
"12.","J","54","2025-12-11","5","Perfect place to celebrate your special birthday. Great service. The food variety isn’t too extensive, but everything tastes good. It would be nice to have more dessert options—maybe you could add pannacotta or ice cream. We really appreciated the excellent service from Kak Novan and Kak Yusuf. Will come back here for sure ❤✨"
"13.","Michelle Dunner","14","2025-11-01","5","There is a lot of care shown at this hotel. The team wants you to have the best experience possible. From a base room we were upgraded to an Artist’s Suite which is enormous. As Accor Platinum members we received complimentary access to the Raffles Club. Check-in was performed in the room by the butler, Rio, who was charming. We then headed to the club for the evening cocktail service where dishes can be ordered from the menu, supplemented by a small buffet. We had breakfast at both Arts Cafe and the club lounge where the staff were kind enough to cater to my wife’s dietary requirements by preparing a special version of nasi goreng. The quality of food can’t be faulted. It was excellent over the course of our six night stay. If I had one area I’d like to see improved is changing what’s on offer for the afternoon tea service. It was the same each day. We also made good use of the swimming pool, where you’re offered complimentary fruit, chilled water and the house signature ginger tea. The gym is also top notch with a great variety of machines and weights. Everyone we met at the hotel took pride in their work and nothing was too much trouble. Our sincere compliments to Head Butler Mr Fachrul and the entire team. Two other elements really enhanced our stay - the coffee at the Arts Cafe was amazingly good, and we also opted to use the hotel’s chauffeur service to and from the airport. This was worth every penny."
"14.","Melody Tsai","26","2025-08-01","5","We stayed at this hotel for four nights, and from the moment we arrived, we felt genuinely welcomed. The staff at check-in were incredibly friendly, even crouching down to assist us during the process that we had never experienced before. The hotel also surprised us with a thoughtful birthday celebration, which deeply touched us and made our stay even more memorable. Housekeeping did an excellent job every day, keeping our room clean and comfortable so we could fully relax. The butler service was outstanding, always attentive and quick to help with any request. Their professionalism and care made our stay even more enjoyable. This is a hotel truly worth staying at. We highly recommend it to anyone visiting Jakarta. A must-stay property that delivers exceptional service and hospitality."
"15.","Ricky Hartono","238","2025-12-18","5","Pengalaman menginap di Hotel Raffles benar-benar berkesan. Sejak pertama masuk, ambient dan vibes-nya terasa tenang, elegan, dan berkelas. Untuk urusan makanan, salah satu yang paling menonjol buat saya adalah Mongolian Beef. Dagingnya empuk, well-marinated, dan bumbunya meresap sempurna. Rasanya seimbang, tidak berlebihan, dan jujur saja… ini numero uno untuk menu sejenis. ✨ Hotel ini cocok untuk staycation bersama keluarga Recommended ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Thanks for the service by Fahmi & Eto tonight 👌🏼"
"16.","Michael Maramis","9","2025-11-01","5","Raffles Jakarta – A Refined Luxury Experience in the Heart of the City My recent stay at Raffles Jakarta was a remarkable experience that exemplified the essence of luxury hospitality. From the moment of arrival, the service excellence and attention to detail were evident throughout every aspect of the stay. The check-in process was efficient and personalized, with the Front Office team demonstrating professionalism and genuine warmth. Upon entering the guestroom, I was immediately impressed by the elegant design, spacious layout, and refined combination of modern comfort with artistic touches that reflect the hotel’s connection to Indonesian culture. The culinary experience at Arts Café by Raffles was another highlight. The restaurant offered an extensive selection of both local and international dishes, all prepared with high quality ingredients and presented with impeccable style. The service team was attentive yet discreet, ensuring a pleasant dining atmosphere from start to finish. During my stay, I also had the opportunity to enjoy the hotel’s wellness facilities, including the swimming pool and the Raffles Spa. Both areas provided a sense of tranquility and exclusivity, perfect for relaxation after a busy day in Jakarta. Overall, Raffles Jakarta stands out not only for its luxurious facilities and prime location, but also for the sincerity and professionalism of its team. The experience truly reflects the legendary Raffles brand philosophy — where every guest is treated with genuine care and attention. It was indeed a memorable stay, and I would highly recommend Raffles Jakarta to discerning travelers seeking timeless elegance and exceptional service in the capital city."
"17.","Youngmin Kim","15","2025-09-01","5","Our experience at Raffles Jakarta was truly delightful. Our very first trip to Jakarta with our two children (5 and 2 years old) was a great success, thanks to the hotel’s excellent facilities and the warm hospitality of the Raffles staff. Raffles provided children’s amenities such as lotion, shampoo, and body wash, and although it was a paid option, the Kids’ tent set up in the room made our children extremely happy. The breakfast restaurant offered a wide selection of gluten-free items, which made it a very suitable choice for our children’s meals. Some of the restaurant staff even went the extra mile by making special pancakes for them, showing exceptional kindness. The kids’ pool was highly satisfying for our children, and we also made good use of the jacuzzi with warm water. The playground connected to the pool was well utilized, and the Kids’ Club, although small, had fun toys and activities (including a PS4). Room service offered a well-prepared kids’ menu at a very reasonable price. The spa was extremely satisfying, and in terms of facilities, I would say it was even better than those at the Ritz-Carlton, which is considered one of the top hotels. At checkout, we were even able to capture a memorable family photo at the entrance of Raffles Jakarta, which left a lasting impression. However, we also hope for a few improvements: Firstly, it would be great if a small plastic step stool were available in the bathroom so that children can wash their hands more easily. Secondly, while the restaurant provided high chairs and children’s tableware, the plates and bowls couldn’t be placed securely on the high chair trays. This is something that could be improved."
"18.","Roayed Samadani","2","2025-12-27","5","An exceptional stay at Raffles Jakarta. From the moment I arrived, the level of service was truly outstanding. The staff were attentive, genuine, and always ready to help with a smile, making me feel welcomed and well cared for throughout my stay."
"19.","H. Sebastian","52","2025-11-01","5","We had a wonderful stay at Raffles. The service was exceptionally attentive and helpful, a good night tea and other attentions made us feel very comfortable. The rooms are large and well maintained. We especially enjoyed the excellent spa treatments and the great tennis facilities. The breakfast buffet was very diverse, with an impressive selection of dishes, particularly the wide range of Asian options. The location is convenient within the city, about 45 minutes from the airport and good restaurants and malls nearby. Overall, we had a great experience and would highly recommend the Raffles hotel"
"20.","Andrew Stec","113","2025-11-01","5","I had an amazing stay at Raffles Jakarta — easily one of the best hotels I’ve ever been to. The hotel is beautiful, spotless, and feels calm the moment you walk in. My room was spacious, extremely comfortable, and had a fantastic city view. My Accor Diamond membership was acknowledged and I received a wonderful upgrade and member privileges. The staff were outstanding — warm, professional, and genuinely thoughtful. A special mention to Daniel and Danielle at Arts Café, who made my breakfasts unforgettable. I asked to try local Indonesian dishes, and they went out of their way to create something new for me. Their kindness and attention to detail really made the experience. I would also like to highlight the Raffles club and the staff there. I spent a lot of time eating and sometimes just sitting and reading during the day. Every single staff member there goes out of their way. There are too many names to remember but I do remember Kevin and his warm greeting when I arrived. I also used the gym every morning around 4 a.m., and it was spotless, well-equipped, and had a great view of Jakarta waking up. Again I forgot the name of the staff member that opens the gym every morning just her was wonderful. Everything — the food, service, and atmosphere — was perfect. Raffles Jakarta gets everything right. Highly recommend."
"21.","Ed Joe","9","2025-12-18","3","I’ve never felt so uncomfortable in a ‘luxury’ hotel. I stayed 4 nights at Raffles Jakarta and felt uncomfortable – not because of the hardware, but because of how the hotel treats its guests. First, my laundry was not delivered at the agreed time and no one explained to me what happened. When I asked at the front desk, I was told the laundry team didn’t want to send it because I hadn’t left a deposit and they were worried I wouldn’t pay. For a hotel at this level, this kind of handling feels very unprofessional and unnecessary. Second, I asked for 10 small boxes of cotton buds because I use them a lot (skincare, makeup, cleaning) and preferred to ask once instead of calling multiple times. Even after I explained this, the on-duty manager seemed very reluctant and, in the end, only sent 5 boxes. It’s a minor item, but the way it was treated made me feel the hotel was overly suspicious of a guest asking for basic amenities. I have stayed at many high-end hotels globally, and I’ve never experienced this level of distrust from a property. Based on this stay, I wouldn’t recommend Raffles Jakarta. ——12/12 Edited——— All other staff are pretty nice though. And breakfast is truly good."
"22.","Jason Rainer","20","2025-12-01","5","We just had a buffet dinner at Raffles Hotel’s Arts Café and it was incredible. Every dish was delicious, and the desserts were absolutely perfect. The service was outstanding Kevin and Novan took care of us with true world-class hospitality. From start to finish, everything was splendid. We’ll definitely be coming back!"
"23.","鄭淳遠","14","2025-12-01","5","Raffles Jakarta is the best hotel I stay in Jakarta with my father. Before I arrive in Jakarta, the concierge team already support me to arrange the transportation and lots of local restaurants booking. When we arrived to the hotel. Thanks for the warm greetings from RHANY and TOGI, it’s quite good to meet you once we arrive at hotel. The check in process was smoothly with the high quality service at the club and also the SPA treatment. My father and I both satisfied with the stay in Raffles. Raffles not only demonstrate high quality of hotel facility and also provide the considerable service during my stay. Thanks again to all of the staff support us during my stay. I cannot wait to stay with Raffles Jakarta again."
"24.","SingShi Soon","22","2025-12-01","5","I had a fantastic stay at Raffles Jakarta Hotel. From check in to check out, the staff were very helpful and friendly. I loved the small touches that the dedicated staff gave such as towel art, night time routine and more! I’d also like to give my compliments to Danielle from the breakfast service for her kind attention and warm service during breakfast and going above and beyond to take our pre orders for the next day. I will definitely be back"
"25.","Ali Hamzah","894","2025-12-01","5","Sesuai bintangnya yang ada lima, rating dari hotel ini memang diberi juga bintang lima. Dari sisi letaknya sudah sangat strategis, terletak di salah satu kawasan termahal di indonesia, kuningan. Bersebelahan dengan mall dan mudah di akses dengan kendaraan pribadi maupun kendaraan umum. Dari sisi bangunan cukup mewah dan glamor, untuk makanan rasanya cukup enak, kamarnya cukup besar dan tersedia bathup. Fasilitas juga lengkap, ada kolam rengan, playground untuk anak-anak baik yang dalam ruangan maupun di luar ruangan."
"26.","Kio Pramesty","3","2025-12-01","4","The hotel's nice, but some of the employees seem to be only happy when they serve foreigners. Domestic guests like me are still being served, but there is a sense of difference. It's all about feelings, because a Hotel should put a lot of comfort in it. And that Feeling will be etched into memory and heart."
"27.","suci istachotil jannah","152","2025-11-01","5","I really appreciate how Raffles has maintained such consistent service quality over the years. I’ve stayed here when I was a Silver, then Gold, and now as a Platinum member — and I can truly see the standard keeps getting higher each time. Thank you so much for the suite upgrade and the complimentary soft toy — such thoughtful touches always make the stay memorable. The lounge experience is one of the best among all hotels I’ve stayed at (even compared to Ca*****). The à la carte menu during the evening cocktails is impressive, and the food quality is top-notch. I look forward to staying at Raffles again in the future."
"28.","Ivan Sebastian","12","2025-12-04","5","From the moment I arrived at Raffles Jakarta, the experience was nothing short of exceptional. As soon as I stepped through the entrance, the staff greeted me by name, immediately recognized my Platinum status, and invited me to proceed with check-in at the Level 12 lounge. I was escorted upstairs by Stacy, who took the time to ask about my wife and daughter—something that later turned into a lovely surprise. At the lounge, Kevin assisted me with the check-in process and informed me that I had been granted a complimentary upgrade all the way to the Gallery Suite, despite having booked the entry-level room. An unexpected and very generous gesture. While completing the check-in, Eto served me drinks and light snacks with such warmth and friendliness that it instantly set the tone for the stay. The Gallery Suite itself was spacious, beautifully designed, and incredibly comfortable. Later that evening, I had a dinner invitation at Arts Café, where every dish was excellent—truly a memorable meal. When I returned to the room after dinner, I found a sweet surprise waiting: a plush toy accompanied by a personalized letter for my daughter. A huge thank-you to Butler Oshel (and of course Stacy) for arranging such a thoughtful touch. The next morning, I chose to have breakfast at Arts Café so I could dine with my relatives. To my surprise, the breakfast was remarkably delicious—even better than my visit in October 2024. I ordered several à la carte dishes and was wonderfully taken care of by Jojo. After the meal, Gio, the restaurant manager, came by to check on us and ask how everything was, which was a very thoughtful gesture. Unfortunately, I had to leave earlier than planned. Otherwise, I’m certain they would have gladly offered a late checkout as well—given how flawless the hospitality had been throughout the stay. Overall, Raffles Jakarta once again delivered outstanding hospitality in every aspect. From the upgrade to the thoughtful surprises to the consistently warm service, it was an experience that truly stood out. Definitely will come again."
"29.","Fred Christ","113","2025-09-01","5","A weekend escape at the Raffles Jakarta was a masterclass in rest and impeccable service. From the moment I stepped out of the car, I was greeted with genuine smiles and warm welcomes by staff (and even remembered my name for whole of my stay). My room was the perfect sanctuary for a deep, restful sleep. While I had a dedicated butler to assist with my needs, the service was so proactive that everything I could have wanted was already taken care of. A huge shout-out to the housekeeping staff who worked magic; my room was always restored to a top-notch condition, with my things thoughtfully arranged. The quiet lounge was a highlight, with remarkable staff always on hand to assist. Breakfast there was excellent. My only regret was missing out on the cocktail hour due to an outside meeting, which I'm sure was just as perfect as everything else. Check-in and check-out were effortless and efficient, and the direct access to Ciputra Mall was incredibly convenient. After such a flawless experience, I'm already wondering why I didn't stay at this hotel as often as it should be!!!"
"30.","Adi Pratama Anwar","289","2025-12-11","5","Saya dan istri sangat menikmati stay singkat kami di Raffles Jakarta. Kami menginap 1 malam tanggal 10-11 Desember untuk merayakan ulang tahun istri saya. Proses check in sangat smooth, untuk ruangan kamar memang mungkin bukan yang very best di Jakarta, tapi hospitality yang kami terima benar-benar top notched. Kami disambut di kamar oleh minuman Mulberry Soda yang sangat segar, Mango Mousse cake yang sangat enak, kolam renang dan fasilitas fitness center yang sangat menyenangkan, dan puncaknya breakfast di Arts Cafe yang sulit kami ungkapkan dengan kata-kata, luar biasa enak makanannya dengan pelayanan yang luar biasa. Special mention saya mau sampaikan untuk mas Yanis (mohon maaf jika salah namanya), petugas fitness center tanggal 11 pagi yang sangat baik dan membantu kami, dan juga petugas kolam renang yang membantu mencarikan pinjaman kacamata renang. Definitely will come back again to Raffles Jakarta someday... 😍😍😍"
"31.","Muhammad Athallah Arsyaf","73","2025-12-01","3","I’ve been to the Raffles twice on two different occasions. Unfortunately for both I was NOT a staying guest, so I could not comment about the suites or overall guest experience. I would assume that they are exemplary as I’ve heard only rave reviews from the people who’ve stayed here in the past. I do want to comment on the MICE experience I had here. I attended a medical congress at Raffles and I naturally had very high expectations. I have no complaints on the venue as surely being very well decorated with the works of Hendra Gunawan make Raffles stand out from other high-end properties in Jakarta. But unfortunately, I did find the dining buffet experience during both times I was here to be rather disappointing. As per the taste, it was always a hit or miss. Some of the food were good but they are not anything to rave about. I do have to admit that the dessert was impeccable. Another complaint I had on crowd-control. The Pavilion outside of the ballroom was jam packed with people. There’s barely any room to move around and queues for food were very long. The turnover for food was also very quick when distrubution started late. So even before 13:00 the food was already brought away. This meant no second servings. Thats really too bad. Most importantly is the hospitality. Both times I was here the staff was not at all hospitable. Naturally, Indonesians are very generous with their smiles and greetings but you will not find this at Raffles. The first time I went in 2021 I remembered how the doorman didn’t even look at us in the face upon our exit, and that kinda stuck with me even till today. Surprisingly even in 2025, this has not changed so much. I only interacted with one of the kitchen attendants, asking whether there’s any food left, and the response I got was not very friendly nor professional. Surely not something you would expect from such a highly appreciated brand. It’s a shame because I think service from the people is what matters the most in this industry. I don’t understand if they judge guest by appearance or something, but I am rather disappointed at the lack of care the staff at Raffles has shown to their non-staying guests."
"32.","Jeffrey Karim","24","2025-09-01","5","Great stay. As a Platinum member, was upgraded to the suite and its beautiful. The child amenities was very great for the kids, the lounge serves some of the best food during evening cocktail. Breakfast was amazing too. My only complaint is when breakfast gets too full, seems like some of our orders were never served and the waiter or waitress needed a reminder"
"33.","Aliza Ashari","48","2025-12-01","5","We were upgraded to a suite. It was such a wonderful experience staying there. The service was tip top. We had afternoon tea with cakes and desserts brought to the suite everyday. Breakfast spread was also excellent. Hospitality was impeccable. Will definitely go back."
"34.","Christina Alexandra Liando","2","2025-11-01","5","I had my wedding recently at Dian Ballroom in Raffles Jakarta. The whole wedding planning process was seamlessly attended by Shella from the Sales Team. She provided us a tour of the ballroom and the suites on the day we met her. One week later and we were sure that we want to have our wedding here. The ballroom is stunning and it allows for rigging decorations which adds a luxurious touch to the event. The food is splendid — I don’t think any dish was below my expectations. Some of my personal favorites included the Rendang Tini and Salmon en Croute. We were served with champagne on the night after the reception and spa the day after. Overall, Shella was really helpful in answering questions I had about the room arrangements, the ballroom event needs, and more. It was such a pleasure to have the event in Raffles!"
"35.","Ken Xie","2","2025-12-01","5","It was a great personalised experience. The staff was very thoughtful and decorated the room along with some sweets for the birthday celebration. One of the staff, Kevin, from the breakfast cafe was extremely helpful both during breakfast and during our stay. He helped organised a takeaway breakfast as my flight was early in the morning."
"36.","Wai Kit Kong","144","2025-11-01","5","I stayed at Raffles Jakarta during a work trip and was thoroughly impressed from start to finish. The service was exceptional, every staff member was warm, attentive, and professional. My room was spacious, spotless, and beautifully designed, with all the amenities I needed for both work and relaxation. The breakfast buffet offered a great variety of high-quality options. Overall, Raffles Jakarta made my work trip not just productive but genuinely enjoyable. Highly recommended for both business and leisure travelers."
"37.","Theresia Trihartika","4","2025-12-01","5","I had a spa treatment here in the couple's room. The room was spacious, fragrant, and clean. The therapist was also skilled at massaging and made sure we were comfortable. The service was very professional and satisfying. Highly recomended."
"38.","Qindah Syifa Aulia Azra","1","2025-12-18","5","Pelayanan staf hotel sangat baik, ramah, dan profesional. Staf sigap membantu, komunikatif, serta memberikan pelayanan dengan sopan sehingga tamu merasa nyaman dan dihargai."
"39.","Samuel Woods","31","2025-09-01","5","I’m currently staying at Raffles Jakarta and I’m so impressed that I wanted to write a review straight away. The hotel feels modern, calming, and just really beautifully designed with stunning artwork, mosaics, and colours throughout. The pool and gardens are absolutely gorgeous, and the gym has everything you could need, machines, row, cycle, treadmill, cable, smith, free weights (up to 26kg dumbbells) - important for me 😂 My room is spacious with a king bed, a huge bathroom with both shower and bathtub, a lounge and study area, and a beautiful garden/city view. Like I can’t believe the value for this room. Breakfast this morning was just incredible. A huge buffet as well as a delicious menu to order from. Included a photo of the menu cause it just blew my mind 😂 The staff here are genuinely warm, friendly, and welcoming. I only checked in late last night, but already feel so much more relaxed. The location is also really convenient, directly connected the shopping centre and easy to get around Jakarta. Will be checking out the H Club tonight which is only about 15min away. I couldn’t be happier with my stay so far. Thankyou 🙏🏽🙏🏽❤️❤️"
"40.","David Bean","3","2025-08-01","5","From the moment we arrived, everything went smoothly. Check-in was quick and easy, and the staff took the time to explain the hotel’s amenities clearly. Our room was absolutely perfect—beautifully laid out, spacious, and with a stunning view. The property itself is top-notch, with high-end finishes throughout, but what really stood out was the service. Everyone we encountered—from housekeeping to the restaurant and spa teams—made us feel truly welcome. The staff at the Writer’s Bar went the extra mile, even showing us how to make their signature Jakarta Sling, which was a real treat. The concierge team offered a walking art tour of the hotel grounds that turned out to be a surprise highlight—definitely worth doing. We also enjoyed spa treatments that were incredibly relaxing, but the food was the real showstopper. Every meal was excellent, and breakfast in particular was unforgettable—easily one of the best I’ve had anywhere. I’ve stayed in many luxury hotels over the years, and this one stands out as the best value by far."

"42.","Amelia Wu","11","2025-08-01","5","A luxurious and serene escape in the heart of Jakarta. The room was spacious and beautifully appointed, with thoughtful details that made the stay feel truly refined. I especially appreciated the warm gesture of offering the welcome drink to be enjoyed in-room, perfect after a late-night check-in. The welcome amenity was delightful too. Staff were attentive, though internal coordination during check-out could be improved (I was called at 11 AM despite confirmed 3 PM late check-out). Also, for a 5-star property under Accor, I expected more consistent member benefits—other properties like other 5stars hotel offer complimentary minibar, which would’ve been a lovely touch here. I later found out the hotel connects directly to Lotte Shopping Avenue, which would’ve been lovely to explore, but sadly none of the staff mentioned it during my stay 🥺. Hopefully next time I can check it out too ! Still, Raffles excels in calm elegance, and I’d love to return."
"43.","Dody Kurniawan","16","2025-10-01","5","Nice hotel in central Jakarta , Breakfast is very delicious and plenty of options. Room is very spacious however we regret that we didn't get any room upgrade as gold member. But, we appreciate the lounge access for gold member . Some suggestion : my children (10 and 11 years old ) complain about so many restriction on this hotel e.g. whirlpool can only for adult and lounge access is also limited to adult. i understand this is business hotel but sometime we also bring our family for business trip. Hopefully, this hotel can be more children friendly."
"44.","Saqib Ahmed","2","2025-10-01","5","We had a wonderful time at the hotel. Staff were really friendly and accommodating. Room was clean and tidy, with staff going out of their way to help us with any requests we had. The room had a number of amenities (i.e, both a bath and shower, snacks, toiletries, etc.), along with the hotel- it has a park, swimming pool, spa, gym and children’s play area. The location is good too, as it is above a shopping mall."
"45.","Jarrad","7","2025-12-01","5","I stayed at Raffles Jakarta for three days for a work trip. It was also the venue of a conference we hosted. The room and event venue were excellent, as was the quality of the customer service throughout the hotel and with all staff I encountered (Danielle in the Arts Cafe was particularly noteworthy for her hospitality, friendliness and attention to detail). Would happily stay at the hotel again and highly recommend Raffles Jakarta to other travellers!"
"46.","Roy Coates","16","2025-12-01","4","The room fas fabulous. The overall service quality was good, especially the waiter at poolside dining during dinner, but there were some inconsistencies in human resources quality. One turn-off was the attitude of the concierge lady when we endorsed our parking ticket during check out."
"47.","Rahma Mulyati","4","2025-10-01","5","The hotel is very luxurious with excellent facilities and delicious food, and its location is also great. What impressed me even more is that the hotel truly cares about people and the planet, focusing not only on guest comfort but also on social responsibility and sustainability, such as adopting eco-friendly practices (using dispenser to reduce bottle plastic use) while providing warm and personalized service"
"48.","Theresia novianty","5","2025-12-01","3","I've always loved Raffles Hotel for its privacy and convenient location, but my recent stay was extremely unpleasant and even frightening. While I was resting in my room, a member of staff suddenly entered without permission. They rang the doorbell three times, but before I could answer, the door opened, and they entered while I was sleeping. I woke up to the sound of the door opening, which was very surprising and completely unacceptable. When I asked the staff why they entered my room without permission, they said they were offering cleaning services. This incident occurred around 8:00 PM, a time during which this curfew usually requires knocking or offering cleaning services. The entire experience was very strange and alarming to me. Thank you."

Hanya agak ke sledding gara2 mini bar hwkwkwk Beneran ini kamar kagak ada bau aneh2, bener2 nyaman, ketika room service datang jg semua di cek mendetail, sampai2 kabel charger/kacamata/headset yg tergeletak itu dirapikan Bahkan kuning telur yg ditaruh sembarangan sama anak di meja juga dikasih piring di tempatnya, bukan di buang atau di pindah tempat. Kolam renang luas dan gak ada bau kaporit sama sekali, bahkan kena mata juga gak perih. Baru datang langsung dikasih handuk dan gak lama dikasih minum dan buah. Hotel menyambung dengan lotte mall, jadi mau apa saja tinggal jaman ke mall. Untuk sarapan, serius harus bener2 lapar agar bisa nyicipin semua menu. Ada 2 lagi fasilitas yg dapat, lupa namanya, cm pas hari terakhir menginap bisa kesana karena weekday anak kecil kagak boleh masuk. Terima kasih raffles untuk kenyamanan dan pelayanan yg sangat luar biasa, serta pengalaman menginap yang mungkin tidak semua orang bisa merasakan. tunggu saya datang lagi yaa"
"69.","Adeline Wu","10","2025-07-01","5","I recently had the pleasure of staying at Raffles Jakarta, and I can confidently say that the service here is truly world-class. From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with genuine warmth and professionalism. The staff are incredibly attentive, well-trained, and always go the extra mile to ensure every guest feels valued. Check-in was seamless, with the front desk staff providing a thorough but swift overview of the hotel’s amenities. My room was immaculate—very spacious. The housekeeping team maintained the room impeccably throughout my stay, with cute towel art surprises! What truly sets Raffles Jakarta apart, however, is the personalized service. Whether it was the concierge arranging a last-minute car booking, the restaurant staff remembering my dietary preferences, or the butler service ensuring every little detail was just right—every interaction felt thoughtful and genuine. Dining at Arts Café by Raffles was another highlight. The variety, quality, and presentation of the food were excellent, and the service was consistently attentive especially by Danielle. In summary, Raffles Jakarta delivers an outstanding hospitality experience that blends luxury with heartfelt service. It’s clear that guest satisfaction is their top priority, and they’ve mastered the art of making you feel both pampered and at home. Highly recommended for both business and leisure travelers"

Lokasi yang strategis, terhubung dengan mall, fasilitas komplit, dengan disertai keramahan staf, mulai security, front liner, bagian restoran, hingga staf kebersihan. Kamar yang sangat luas dibandingkan hotel bintang sejenis, terasa dejavu dg hotel yg pernah sy inapi di Dubai. Amenities yang komplit dan bertemakan go green semakin menambah kesan istimewa hotel ini. Variasi sarapan pagi, siang, dan malam yang beranekaragam, ditambah pilihan model menu a la carte yg memudahkan customer memilih dengan cepat, selain tetap bisa buffet. Staf resto cukup tanggap dan ramah. Semoga ada kesempatan menginap di hotel ini lagi. Best hotel in Jakarta."

The service is exceptional—every staff member greets you with genuine warmth and attention to detail that sets a new standard for luxury hospitality. The rooms are spacious, elegantly designed, and impeccably clean. Floor-to-ceiling windows offer breathtaking views of the Jakarta skyline, and the bed? Easily one of the most comfortable I’ve ever slept in. Breakfast at Arts Café is a highlight. The spread is both diverse and high quality—fresh pastries, Indonesian specialties, international selections, and made-to-order dishes. Every meal felt curated with care. The hotel’s interior, inspired by the legendary Hendra Gunawan, is visually stunning. Every corner feels like a blend of modern elegance and rich Indonesian culture. The pool, spa, and fitness center are top-notch, making it a perfect retreat within the city. Whether you're traveling for business or leisure, Raffles Jakarta is a true sanctuary in the heart of the city. I’ll absolutely return—and recommend it to anyone looking for an unforgettable luxury experience in Jakarta."

"125.","faned maulid","134","2025-07-01","5","From the moment we arrived at Raffles Hotel Jakarta, the hospitality exceeded all expectations. The level of service, particularly from the Raffles Club Lounge staff, was truly outstanding. Every team member we encountered was attentive, warm, and genuinely eager to make our 3 night stay as comfortable and memorable as possible. One of the highlights of our stay was the Raffles Club Lounge experience. The food presentation was elegant and thoughtful, showcasing a perfect balance between aesthetic appeal and culinary excellence. Each dish we tried was bursting with flavor, clearly crafted with high-quality ingredients and attention to detail. The staff at the lounge made sure we were well looked after at all times, providing personalized service that made us feel valued and relaxed. Our room was exceptionally spacious, elegantly furnished, and equipped with luxurious amenities that added an extra layer of comfort to our stay. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and the bathroom felt like a private spa—truly a haven after a long day in the city. What truly set Raffles Jakarta apart was the generous hospitality offered throughout our stay. We were pleasantly surprised with a free room upgrade, and the flexibility of early check-in and late check-out made a huge difference to our travel schedule. It’s rare to find a hotel that goes the extra mile in such a thoughtful and seamless way. Lastly, a special thanks to the concierge team, who were incredibly helpful and knowledgeable. Whether it was providing recommendations, or assisting with our luggage, they handled every request with professionalism and a smile. Overall, Raffles Hotel Jakarta offers beyond five-star experience that is hard to match. The combination of luxurious accommodations, gourmet dining, and world-class service makes this property a top choice for anyone seeking comfort, elegance, and personalized hospitality in Jakarta. We look forward to returning soon"
"126.","Mairieska Putri","2","2025-08-01","4","Overall, the stay was pleasant. However, this was my fourth time staying at Raffles, and for the first time, I felt uncomfortable during check-in. Usually, the staff are very friendly, but this was not the case during my last stay. I asked if I could use a breakfast voucher and upgrade my room (as I am an Accor Plus member), but the response was rather rude, as I was told I was not a Gold member and that the terms and conditions did not apply to Raffles hotels (in a rude manner and with a very unpleasant facial expression). However, I did not receive accurate information from your marketing department when explaining the benefits of being an Accor Plus member. If I had been given accurate information, I would not have asked the receptionist those questions. Please improve the receptionist service and inform the Accor Plus manager to explain the details to customers so this does not happen again in the future."
"127.","Melanie Brousseau","2","2025-07-01","5","This is the best hotel in Jakarta. The rooms are luxurious, the hotel is beautiful and the staff are amazingly helpful. I enjoyed our 10-day stay.

I highly recommend the Raffles Jakarta Hotel."

The staff was so welcoming, attentive ; they couldn’t do enough to ensure our stay was perfect. My tummy was a bit iffy one day, I didn’t even need to ask before Danielle made sure I had some special ginger tea! The butler service ensured I had an easy check in and was extremely helpful in offering city tours after I had shown an interest in seeing Jakarta at dinner one evening. I want to say a very special thank you to Kevin who went above and beyond and beyond for us - graciously offered to have special Indonesian dishes prepared especially for us. The Beef Rendang was delicious!!! My husband and I would like to mention just a few members of staff that impressed us with their attention and excellent service- Jo, Ahmad, Francesco, Danielle, Valen , and of course Kevin from Victoria, lol.

Tempat strategis, fasilitas maksimal terlebih lagi dengan adanya connecting passage ke mall ciputra. Pelayanan selama ini cukup baik, tapi baru hari ini Senin June 9th, 2025 saya merasakan adanya diskriminasi pelayanan antara orang asing dengan lokal oleh waitress wanita di coffee shopnya. Klien saya yang WNA dilayani dengan ramah sementara saya WNI diperlakukan dengan ketus? Why? So weird. Jauh lebih ramah satpam yang jaga pintu gerbang dan metal detector, trully 5 star hotel hospitality. Sementara bagian yang harusnya memberikan hospitality malah hostile, wangat meninggalkan kesan yang buruk untuk saya. Semoga bisa diperbaiki."
"142.","Reza Nugraha","167","2025-07-01","5","From the moment I arrived, the service at Raffles Jakarta was nothing short of outstanding. Every staff member I encountered was professional, courteous, and consistently went above and beyond—truly a testament to Raffles’ renowned hospitality. As an Accor Platinum Plus member, I was pleasantly surprised with a complimentary room upgrade to a suite. The room was incredibly clean, neat, and spacious—elegantly designed with comfort and functionality in mind. It felt like a true sanctuary in the heart of the city. The hotel’s facilities were just as impressive. The gym was well-equipped, spacious, and ideal for both casual workouts and more serious training. I also enjoyed the serene pool area and the relaxing jacuzzi—perfect for unwinding after a long day. Another major plus is the location. The hotel is directly connected to Lotte Shopping Avenue, giving easy access to restaurants, shops, and entertainment options without having to step outside. Overall, Raffles Jakarta delivered an impeccable experience on all fronts—service, comfort, amenities, and location. I look forward to returning on my next visit."

"154.","Gisela","98","2025-08-01","5","My recent visit to Arts Cafe at Raffles Hotel Jakarta was an exceptional journey into refined dining and impeccable service. Every dish and interaction surpassed expectations. The front-of-house team was exemplary. Johandy and Nanda provided service that was not just efficient, but genuinely warm, intuitive, and highly professional, making the entire meal flow seamlessly and feel incredibly special. We came during Chef Theo's Culinary Journey set. The culinary creations were nothing short of art, showcasing immense talent. My deepest gratitude to the brilliant chefs: Chef Kevin, demonstrated a profound understanding of flavors and presentation across the menu. Chef Alfin absolutely nailed the Sate Maranggi and Jimbaran Lobster – both were incredibly flavorful and perfectly cooked. Truly capturing the essence of authentic Indonesian flavors. Chef Azcha designed a set menu that was a symphony of tastes and textures, with each course thoughtfully conceived and flawlessly executed, leaving a lasting and delightful impression. And for lovers of Japanese cuisine, Chef Dyaz delivered an exquisite array of sushi and sashimi, showcasing the freshest ingredients, a true delight for the senses. The Arts Cafe at Raffles Hotel Jakarta is a culinary destination where every detail is perfected, offering unparalleled gastronomic comfort, and a truly world-class dining experience. Highly recommended for anyone seeking a top-tier gastronomic experience."

"159.","Deepti Shinh","352","2025-07-01","3","Overall had a very disappointing experience celebrating our anniversary here. We stayed over one night.Had a lovely surprise in the room with anniversary wishes and a lovely cake.The room itself was large and beautiful with wonderful views of the city. The hotel itself is stunning with lovely artwork and decor. Swimming pool was beautiful and loved the jacuzzi. A little cold in the pool most of the time as the buildings cover the sun. Fantastic gym! We went for drinks to their bar at 2pm and they didn't offer us the alcohol menu. When we specifically asked for it and then asked for signature drinks from it, we were told it wasn't available as the mixologist wasn't there and would be in at 4pm. We went again for pre dinner drinks, listened to lovely live music and again the signature drink I wanted wasn't available! Asked for a simple margherita and they charged us a price that was more than their signature drink prices! Many of the drinks like the beers on the menu was not available. Bar food was bland and mediocre. Was disappointing. Went out for an early dinner and came back to the hotel. Both of us felt very hungry at about 11.30pm and ordered the only meat pizza they had on their in room dining 24/7 menu and they tell me 15mins later that the pizza is not available! When we checked out, we weren't even asked how our stay was ..guess they didn't want any feedback or cared enough to know if we enjoyed our stay or not. We have been to Raffles in other countries and by far this was the most disappointing experience. Overall felt more like a business hotel"

Overall I have to state that the way of guest treatment established at Raffles Jakarta is seriously on an international top level! Starting from a heart warming welcome process at arrival, an exciting club level lounge experience with really wide choices of excellent food until an unexpected and excellent claim handling process (perfect internal communication at Raffles team, at this stage special thanks to food Manager Giordy and also the Club Lounge team) Raffles Jakarta treats customers really with a total care approach!

When we were checkout we had to pay 1 million rupiah for that ONE soap bottle. Our suggestion is, don't put a ceramic soap bottle inside a shower room without any protection, As our experience, all hotels ALWAYS have some sort of protection to the soap bottle or it stick on the wall. We concluded that this hotel isn't kids-friendly or family friendly hotel."
"173.","Hendrawan Daryono Karso","1","2025-06-01","3","Stayed here for a short business trip. The hotel was clean and the staff were polite, but I had a disappointing experience that affected the overall stay. I was informed that hotel-provided slippers aren’t allowed in the breakfast area. Since I only had formal shoes and assumed the in-room slippers would be acceptable for a quick breakfast, this came as a surprise. There was no mention of this policy at check-in or in the room information. For a hotel in this price range, this felt unnecessarily inconvenient and avoidable — especially for guests on a short stay."

"200.","darren lim","3","2025-06-01","5","Food options were great at the hotel. Highly recommend Arts Cafe for breakfast and Butcher's Table for Friday dinner. They have the usual buffet options as well as made-to-order live kitchen food selection. What we like about the buffet includes the small matters like they provide orange slices and longnan peeled. Room service food options were great too as the portions were huge and the food were tasty. Service from the staff were exceptional and the room were huge and well designed. We had arranged the airport transfer, which made the arrival and departure process seamless as the staff were already waiting at the lobby for your arrival for in-room check-in. The hotel is connected to a mall, which has multiple shopping and food options, as well as a supermarket. It is also within the Kuningan area that has plenty of cafe and restaurant options. Review from SG."

"206.","Brio Brio","2","2025-01-01","4","I recently stayed at Raffles Jakarta with my family, and overall, it was a satisfying experience. The hotel itself is stunning, with spacious, comfortable, and clean rooms. The in-house amenities, which are exclusive to Raffles, were fantastic and definitely added to the comfort of our stay. However, there were a few aspects that could have elevated the experience. Upon check-in, it did take quite some time, which was a bit frustrating after a long journey. Although the staff were friendly, the level of service could definitely have been better. For instance, I never met my assigned butler during my stay, and no one showed us to our room. While this might not be a huge issue for some, I felt that these small gestures of personal service would have made a big difference, especially in a luxury hotel like this. The staff were all Indonesian, but their service style felt more Westernized, which didn't seem to align with the warm, natural Indonesian hospitality I'm accustomed to. A bit more local flair in service would have been appreciated—it’s the small details that make a stay feel more welcoming. That said, the dining experience was one of the highlights of our stay. The food at the hotel was exceptional, and I would rank it among the best I've had in any hotel. I particularly enjoyed the evening cocktails and the breakfast at the Raffles Club. Both were top-notch, with a great selection and impeccable quality. In terms of overall experience, I’d say it was a satisfying stay. While the service could use some improvement, the facilities and dining made up for it. I would recommend this hotel to others, though with a note that if you’re seeking a more personalized, attentive service experience, there might be better options in the area."
"207.","Suraya Toenova","2","2025-05-01","5","One of the best hotels I’ve stayed at, with service at the highest level. All the hotel staff are incredibly friendly and helpful with any questions. Thank you to the hotel for such a great attitude towards guests. When I was a bit late for breakfast, restaurant staff kindly allowed me to have it a bit later than usual. Mr. Kevin Hendra helped me choose from the menu and did everything possible to ensure a comfortable breakfast. It was incredibly delicious! (Benedict with salmon, dragon fruit juice) 👍 I also want to highlight the cleanliness of the hotel, which not all places can boast of. In my opinion, the service and design of this hotel surpasses that of the Ritz-Carlton, Jumeirah, and Marriott hotels. I want to thank the hotel staff for making my stay unforgettable and cozy like home. Thank you, Jakarta, Indonesia, for such a warm welcome!"

Also Rhany was wonderful, taking the trouble to recommend places to visit for my mum and aunt while I work and even went to the trouble to go to the Ranch Market to take pictures of items they might want to buy while on the trip.

The service throughout our stay was warm, personal, and effortlessly elegant. A special mention must go to Aprilia and Theresa from the Writers Bar, who made every evening a delight. Their impeccable service, charm, and incredible knowledge of the menu (and cocktails!) elevated our experience—it's rare to meet staff who combine such professionalism with genuine warmth. Mornings were a highlight thanks to the incredible breakfast team, who took the time to introduce us to a range of authentic Indonesian dishes. Their thoughtful guidance helped us truly appreciate the flavours and traditions of the local cuisine, making each breakfast a cultural as well as culinary experience. Finally, we’re deeply grateful to Egy, our butler, who went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. From restaurant bookings to small, thoughtful gestures, he was always available, incredibly kind, and consistently accommodating. Raffles Jakarta doesn't just offer luxury—it offers heart. We left feeling pampered, inspired, and already dreaming of a return."

The treatments were expertly administered, leaving me feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. The swimming pool was the perfect place to unwind, and while the jacuzzi was a bit too warm for my preference, it didn't detract from the overall luxury of the experience. Our room was spacious and beautifully appointed, with a welcome gift that made us feel valued, especially after a long day of travel. The bathroom was a luxurious retreat, featuring a deep soaking tub and a spacious walk-in closet. Raffles Jakarta is truly a gem, offering a perfect blend of luxury, comfort, and impeccable service."

Of course, you can always find flaws and complain about the little things, but in general, the hotel is simply amazing and unforgettable.

"236.","KT B","70","2025-12-01","5","Consistently above and beyond what other hotels in the same category and price range can offer. Every single crew member in almost every department I interacted with has been exemplary. From Defri at the concierge desk (and others too; sorry I can't remember their names), to the butler and Raffles Club team (Aca, Rashya, Kevin, Salma, Rifdah, Qorry, Austin and of course, Eto, who is always so accommodating and friendly). I like the new evening cocktail food menu rotation at the Raffles Club. Now the menu changes every night and the ones I've tried were all really good. The gym equipment was very modern and the spa was a must-try. The only slight dent to the stay experience was the subpar service at The Writers Bar. But I trust it was a one-off occurence. I've also managed to have the Sunday Brunch at Arts Cafe and I quite enjoyed it. I'll try to write another review for this."

They have outdoor large pool, outdoor jacuzzi, 2 fields of tennis, large garden with walking track and kids outdoor playground, kids club, adequate gym equipment, and connected to Lotte Shopping Avenue. All of these are more than adequate to quench guests boredom if long stay. I think no other hotel in Jakarta that can provide all of this, simply the best hotel in Jakarta."

The service is incredible for the most part except at breakfast in the lounge. The first day, it was super slow to get food. The second day, slow again and they didnt bring some orders despite waiting close to 1 hour. It made us late for a meeting. However, when I brought this to the attention of the hotel, the next day service improved and they also provided some nice gestures. There was also some error with laundry delivery but they eventually sorted it out. The Writer's bar service is a bit slow also. I would still return and recommend this hotel."

Service was top notch throughout my stay, the staff attentiveness and willingness to assist with any request truly enhanced my experience. The hotel boasts stylish and modern interiors that immediately caught my eye upon arrival. The design is both chic and comfortable, providing a visually pleasing yet relaxing atmosphere. The swimming pools, in particular, were a real highlight. Breakfast was a lavish affair with some buffet and order from the menu book options, and I think the MVP here is the steak, if you happen to stay here, you should try it! God knows that was really good. The location is also brilliant, perfectly situated to offer a welcome retreat from the frantic pace of the city. Despite being centrally located, the hotel provides a peaceful sanctuary where one can unwind and relax after a busy day. Overall, my stay at Raffles was nothing short of great. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a stylish and modern place to stay with excellent staff and a prime location."
"245.","host23 Goen","888","2025-11-01","4","Service is superb, room is spacious, hardware and hard products are of good quality. Local marble but still well designed. Too bad the food quality is kinda mediocre. Art cafe and raffles club food are about the same quality. Location is good and bad. Good because it is close to many places, bad because of bad traffic jam most of the time. Swimming pool, kids club, gym and landscapes are superb."
"246.","Marcel Riemer","15","2025-06-01","5","I visited the Raffles Hotel Jakarta today for the first time and joined their breakfast buffet. I had a good feeling before I went, and my entire experience turned out even better than expected. The atmosphere in the restaurant is, through its interior design, very cozy and comfortable. I liked the boutique-style buffet set up. The food was very well and neatly presented. The variety was sufficient. Japanese sushi and special egg dishes, which are very creative, will be made to order. I had the beef tenderloin and fried egg with mushrooms and roasted potatoes. The absolute kicker was the dessert counter: a great variety of homemade pastries, very nicely presented. This stood out to me! The price for the buffet is IDR 260000++/adult. Great value for money! What also stood out to me was the exceptional performance by the entire service team. The team is extremely attentive and has a fine eye for detail without being too intrusive. I felt well taken care of. These guys are very well-trained, polite, and courteous. I especially want to thank Ms. Danielle Hibbert, Restaurant Supervisor, and Mr. Frans. These two colleagues are very competent and enthusiastic, and I appreciate their professional appearance and attentiveness. Will be back soon! Thanks, Chef Marcel"

"254.","robichon philippe","1","2025-06-01","5","I don't usually use this adjective to describe my stays in a hotel. However, it is the word that comes to mind when talking about my 10-day stay at the Raffles Hotel in Jakarta. The hotel is located in the Kuningan district, adjacent to the Ciputra World Mall. It is a 30-minute walk from the Bundaran HI monument, which can be considered Jakarta's city center. I say this because in a city like Jakrata, location is a strategic point. There are many dining options in the immediate vicinity of the hotel, within a 10-minute walk. As a platinum member I was upgraded to an artistic suite on the 23rd floor. The room is about 100 m2 with a living room, a huge bedroom, a bathroom with a dressing room and especially huge bay windows. The bed is to die for comfort. There is a water purification machine very useful in Jakarta. The choice of TV channels is also perfect from my point of view. There are many little touches that make the difference, from the room service, with a story every evening slipped onto the bed, the shaving kit on the sink, personalized bookmarks, with little notes left by the staff in charge of cleaning the room. Raffles Jakarta was founded by a passionate collector of Indonesian paintings and sculptors Hendra Gunawan.. The hotel pays homage to him through its artwork and decor. Every day, you discover how much of a museum this hotel is, with its explosion of colors. I loved the food at Art Cafe and every day Chef Alvin came to offer me a new Indonesian dish. Breakfast is truly complete with very high-quality food. There is a buffet with dishes that change daily, and a menu from which you can order. Note that the meat is truly exceptional as well as the pastry with croissants much better than in Paris!!!! I would like to thank the staff at Art Café who really took care of me and anticipated all my wishes. Kevin, the all my dreams come true man, Chelsea, who patiently taught me new Indonesian phrases, Gio, Yusuf, Tendy, is trendy, and my favorite waiter, Daniel. As a platinum member, I had access to the Raffles Club Lounge on the 12th floor with afternoon tea or evening cocktails. Here too, the choice is perfectly calibrated with a buffet of Indonesian dishes and a menu. The dishes are generous and delicious. I must also thank Chef Agnés for her attentive welcome and generous cuisine. As I am a lover of Indonesian cuisine, she prepared me nasi pasdang and Sop buntut which were marvelous. Thanks also to Yuli for her kindness. There is also a cocktail menu with her Jakarta Sling, an Indonesian version of the Singaporean version. We had a selection of very high quality Australian meat on several evenings. There's also a large swimming pool on the 14th floor with a huge rooftop garden. It's a shame the place lacks sunlight. The Raffles is certainly the best hotel in Jakarta and the service is truly top-notch. As a platinum member, I was truly treated like royalty, and many hotels in the Accor group, including the Pullman Jakarta, should take a leaf out of their book. When something is good, you have to say it, and when it's extraordinary, you have to find the words to express it. Thank you once again to the entire team for making my stay a memorable one."

As seen in the picture: - conditioner empty and IDK who open the dispenser tho. - floor drain full of hair and the water aren’t goes directly. - wastafel also a lot of hairfall. The pool guard rarely shown at the station, IDK who to call or ask."

The hotel's ambiance is elegant, the service is impeccable, and the food and beverage offerings were exceptional. As Platinum Accor members, we particularly enjoyed the fantastic breakfast and the wonderful Raffles Club for afternoon tea and dinner. It's a perfect choice for a family staycation in Jakarta."

Each with its uniqueness atmosphere with the combination of Indonesian art and culture."
"272.","Gabriel Ladkani","4","2025-06-01","5","Raffles Jakarta is more than just a hotel—it’s a living gallery, where exquisite artwork and thoughtful storytelling surround you at every turn. From the moment I arrived, the experience was elevated by impeccable, deeply personalized service—Juan at the concierge set the tone, while Nurul and Lilis at the spa ensured pure relaxation, and Kevin and Chelsia made the breakfast buffet unforgettable. The food throughout was a journey in itself, rich in flavor and artistry. Every night felt like a dream thanks to the blissful bedding and sleep pillows. From the serene pool to the attentive staff whose names I may not recall but whose warmth I won’t forget, Raffles Jakarta went the extra hundred miles—and then some."
"273.","Ian Hay","447","2025-01-01","5","stunning . 5star service is exceptional and such a wonderful stay. i stayed on an executive floor and access to the lounge which is simply fantastic. Breakfast served at your table and small but excellent selection of meals, afternoon snacks and tea (if you happen to be around) and then dinner served 6-9, with wine. No need to go out the food was so good and proper service at your table. Bedrooms are superb, bed beds are so comfortable i slept without once walking up which is rare for me. Staff - well trained , responsive, knowledgeable and speak perfect English. Cant wait to go back."

"276.","Evan Yang","53","2025-01-01","5","Overall, the amenities and service were excellent from my arrival to my departure. Most staff members were friendly without being overly attentive, which made for a comfortable and pressure-free experience. The breakfast was delicious, offering a variety of buffet options along with made-to-order dishes at no extra charge. The weekend breakfast was even better than on regular days, though I do wish they had included more tropical or local fruits beyond the decent melons and oranges. The pastry section, somewhat tucked away, was a delightful surprise, I highly recommend exploring it for the delicious desserts. I also highly recommend the spa services, which include a steam room, massage treatments, swimming pools, and a gym. Therapists Rika and Tia were exceptional; my massage experiences were far superior to those I’ve had at other hotels in the area. The ginger tea and cookies provided after the treatments were a thoughtful touch. However, the room did feel a bit humid on some days, and there was a slight moldy smell. This could be improved. Also, make sure to have the driver drop you off at the hotel lobby; if not, they may drop you at the mall. While it’s easy to find the hotel from there, carrying luggage might be slightly exhausting. Lastly, I want to mention Dul, who always seemed to be at the lobby whenever I needed assistance. He was incredibly helpful and patient, making my stay even more enjoyable."

"295.","rudy hou","8","2025-02-01","4","This hotel is in the central region of the city, about 20 minute drive from the SCBD area or 1.5 hours drive from the international airport Soekarno-Hatta in the north. Location-wise, it is right by a main street of Prof.Dr.Satrio Road in Kuningan area, where there are 4 other malls along the same road. The hotel tower is right beside Lotte-Ciputra Mall, with a direct connection/access. Friendly and professional staff from security to front office to housekeeping to fitness center and spa. Room (Garden View NS) was clean and very spacious. Complimentary wifi is fast. Bed is huge but I find the mattress a bit too soft for my liking, however, they provide a dozen type of pillow to choose from for those seeking a better comfort. Room comes with sun-blocked curtains but the room not exactly sound-proof. My room was facing the pool view and I could easily hear noise from outside (New Year pool party and from heavy rain). BIG PLUS - the room comes with its own water dispenser, and can request a refill if needed. Clean, bright, spacious bathroom with necessary amenities and a very pleasant rain-shower stall and bathtub and large bottles of soap/shampoo. The separate enclosed toilet area comes with a japanese style bidet function. Hotel has great facilities, though unfortunately I had no time to try the pool. I did, however, had a chance to enjoy the spacious 24-hour gym (overlooking high-rise buildings) and the steam sauna (inside the spa). The complimentary sauna facility is very spacious and comes with a separate sound-sensory rain-shower stall. Overall, it has been a nice experience but I wished I had a better sleep."

Moreover, one of the Raffles employees who I think is very helpful is Audrey from Guest Experience. She gave her best service to my family and me from the lobby to my room, even on my departure.

"308.","J B","34","2025-07-01","5","Edit : My friend tried to book the spa with her gift card, however she lost the physical voucher so I sent her the pdf version that the hotel actually sent to me. To our surprise it’s declined with the reason “the physical voucher is needed due to the requirement in the finance dept”. I contacted the spa admin and they said they can’t do anything about it. I paid 2.662.000 IDR and it will be a waste just because the physical voucher is not present. It is such a shame to have this kind of hospitality level in a what so called 5 star hotel but the staff is unbelievably useless and not helpful at all for after sales trouble. PLEASE BE CAREFUL BECAUSE THE STAFF WILL ONLY BE NICE AND HELPFUL WHEN YOU ARE ABOUT TO PURCHASE. BUT NOT FOR AFTER SALES. Ignore my previous review below. I was looking for a last minute gift for a good friend that lives in Jakarta. I decided to contacted Raffles hotel and get connected with the Wellness department to purchase a gift card in Raffles Spa. The entire process from answering my queries up to sending the gift card was very smooth. Heni from the Spa customer service was helping me through the process, showing me the template of the gift card and making sure that the gift card get picked up properly. She even helped me made a personalized message to be sent with the gift card. As a customer who doesn’t live in Indonesia, I deeply appreciate the effort she put on helping me. She is showing the true meaning of providing hospitality. Simplify the customer needs, efficient and personalized. Thank you, Heni."

Turn down service by re making beds ,leaving a bedtime story , everything from the rooms it's size the bathspace, toiletries, welcome.drink,fruits ,chocolates and a personalized welcome note are done with great class and personal touch. The breakfast spread can do better , have more options for vegetarians, though service was with great warmth and charm there can be more organised way to deal.with requests (the orders n requests were mixed up amongst guests at same table). Despite the crowd ,it's expected that it be handled meticulously. Good luck , hope to come back again."

Servicenya sangat bagus, begitu check in, petugas sudah langsung menyambut dan jika kita melakukan reservasi sebelumnya, dengan menyebutkan nama depan saja, petugas langsung bisa menyebutkan nama lengkap. Kamar langsung siap saat itu juga. Saya membawa anak kecil, dan ketika memesan ada mention, sehingga di kamar juga disediakan sabun, shampo, lotion dan sikat gigi anak-anak. Makanan resto juga enak, memang pilihannya tidak sebanyak hotel bintang 5 lainnya, namun hotel ini menyediakan makanan yang sangat enak menurut saya (semua makanannya enak). Petugas jg ingat nama dan preferensi kita. Saya menginap dua malam, kedua kali saya ke resto, petugas ingat tempat duduk saya sebelumnya dan preferensi makanan saya kemarin. Lokasi juga bersebelahan dengan mall. Hotel ini sangat recommended."

Semua pegawainya, full of smile. Terutama pegawai di restoran very helpful, rasa makanannya saat breakfast jadi tambah nikmat. Di setiap sudut ruangannya terasa wangi. Terutama praying room nya di lantai bawah. Senang bgt. Saat di kamar, bagian bathroom, ada 2 keset yang cukup besar dan itu bermakna bgt karna tidak semua hotel menyediakan keset seperti itu. Kamar mandi tetap kering. Petugas jaga di connecting door antara hotel dan Lotte mal, saat hari Kamis tidak sesigap dan seramah di hari Rabu. Hehe.

Kalau gt jgn ditawarkan dibuatkan omelet jd tidak menunggu dan tidak datang. Apa SOP membuat omelet lebih dari 30 menit? kemudian Saya merasa dibedakan dari tamu asing yg pelayanannya cepat (meja sebelah), ini rasis apa gmn ya? Terima kasih."

"385.","Adrian S","351","2025-01-01","5","I must say this is undoubtedly one of the best hotels in Jakarta in terms of service. I tried the ‘equivalent’ for Bonvoy and their service cannot meet what raffles can do. The staff are very attentive, they recognize you and make every attempt to anticipate your needs. For example they (the butlers) know what I used to order and suggests the mulberry soda whenever I check in. (Recommended - this is their signature drink!) The rooms are spacious and they recognize ALL Accor platinum members like me - the manager notes, the free snacks and chocolates, and others. You can order more than tea and coffee (unlike the Bonvoy equivalent) from the butler. One super special treat is the Raffles Lounge located on the 12th floor - with their own chef and pastry chef. Really good service and the food is superb - even though it’s complementary. Every visit you feel recognized and the staff service is always on par. Completely recommend the hotel."

From the moment I reserved the Artist Suite King Non-Smoking, the impeccable service began. Mr. Fachrul, Head of Butler Services, personally contacted me to ensure a seamless arrival and attend to any pre-arrival requests. As a Platinum member, I was delighted to experience a private check-in at the exclusive Raffles Club Lounge on the 12th floor. The lounge itself was a haven of refined elegance, offering delectable culinary creations and impeccable service throughout the day. Breakfast at the hotel's restaurant was equally impressive. The extensive selection catered to every palate, but the exquisite banana cake and renowned pancakes were truly exceptional. The entire staff demonstrated a genuine commitment to hospitality, with Mr. Giordy, the FB Manager, deserving particular praise for his attentiveness and professionalism. My Artist Suite was a sanctuary of refined luxury. In all, my stay at the Raffles Jakarta surpassed expectations. It was a testament to the hotel's ability to provide a truly rejuvenating escape, even within the bustling city center. I wholeheartedly recommend the Raffles Jakarta to discerning travelers seeking an unparalleled experience of luxury and personalized service."

Even an entry level suite is very generous in size, just make sure you’re assigned a room away from the main road. We were facing the main road (highway) and even on the 21st floor the traffic noise was very loud. But especially at night it was unbearable, as at times it sounded like aircraft were landing there. I suspect that they were doing some kind of illegal motor races during the night. The pool area is also pretty nice for a city hotel…..and the water is cold, allowing for a refreshing dip. The breakfast was fine, but not necessarily anything special or memorable. Overall it’s a fine hotel, it’s just that the location (and road noise) is a bit off."

One thing that need to improve is the soundproofing from the street. I could hear the vehicle sound from my bedroom. Overall the experience was awesome. Thank you for the butlers and the staffs."

It’s too bad because we counted the money before we left the room. It’s just that we didn’t expect someone will clean the room so early while we were having our breakfast in Arts Cafe. Overall, it’s still a good one, just don’t leave your money inside the room."

Our butler, Dwiki Tiano, also made a lasting impression with his professional and attentive service. The food we had delivered to our room was top-notch. The staff, in general, are exceptionally well-trained, extremely friendly, and highly competent. We would like to extend our gratitude to all the employees for the outstanding service we enjoyed during our stay. Another highlight was the hotel’s direct connection to the adjacent shopping mall, which made shopping convenient and allowed us to easily store our bags in our room.

Rasanya kenyal bahkan untuk ukuran medium. Secara keseluruhan, tidak direkomendasikan."
"476.","tobi d.","243","2023-01-21","1","Saya menginap di sini karena Fairmont sudah penuh. Saat tiba, saya ditawari kamar yang lebih baik, tetapi bukan kamar merokok seperti yang saya pesan. Pihak hotel memang mengatur kamar merokok lain (Suite, yang sebenarnya tidak saya sukai karena terlalu besar), tetapi menunggu lama untuk kamar tersebut sangat merepotkan. Selain itu, pindah ke kamar lain terlebih dahulu, membongkar barang, dan kemudian mengemasnya kembali bukanlah pilihan yang tepat. Kamar baru tersebut memiliki seorang pelayan yang memperkenalkan diri, tetapi saya tidak pernah melihatnya lagi, selalu ada orang lain yang datang - jadi selalu dibutuhkan tip tambahan, dan itu sudah diperkirakan. Hanya ada sandal wanita di kamar - petugas kebersihan meletakkan beberapa sandal besar di hari kedua tanpa saya minta dan sebuah catatan 'khusus untuk saya'? Petugas kebersihan dan layanan kamar memiliki layanan terbaik, satu-satunya layanan yang baik di hotel ini. Mereka juga meninggalkan beberapa kartu/catatan yang indah. Gedung ini sama sekali tidak kedap suara. Saya berada di lantai 16 dan pada dasarnya dapat mendengar percakapan keras di jalan. Belum lagi suara mobil dan sirene, yang merupakan bagian standar dari pemandangan kota Jakarta. Mereka memang menawarkan penyumbat telinga, tetapi ini adalah hotel, bukan pesawat terbang. Hanya ada satu cangkir kopi dan satu lagi kapsul kopi tanpa kafein di kamar. Mungkin karena semakin banyak pesanan antar, semakin banyak tip yang diberikan. Sarapan sebagian besar (90%) ditujukan untuk selera Asia, sulit sekali mendapatkan telur rebus setengah matang yang sempurna (hanya telur dari layanan kamar yang enak) dan saya harus mengejar barang-barang yang seharusnya diantar ke meja - jus jeruk segar, mentega - yang menambah waktu sarapan saya sekitar 20-30 menit. Dan siapa yang menyajikan mentega dalam bentuk bola-bola kecil? Mungkin terlihat lucu, tetapi apakah ada yang pernah mencoba memotong mentega yang berbentuk bulat? Karena saya harus menunggu taksi saat check-out - mereka tidak senang saya memesan taksi dan tidak memesan melalui mereka dengan biaya tambahan - saya pikir saya sebaiknya menikmati minuman selamat datang saya. Saya diminta menunjukkan voucher 'kertas', yang saya tinggalkan di kamar. Mengapa Accor, yang mengklaim sangat berkelanjutan, masih mengeluarkan voucher kertas? Seharusnya mereka bisa memasukkan informasi tersebut ke dalam sistem POS mereka yang terhubung dengan nomor kamar. Dengan ribuan hotel yang terdaftar, berapa banyak kertas yang terbuang per hari? Apakah itu sebabnya mereka mengenakan biaya tambahan US$ untuk menanam pohon? Terakhir, saya tidak pernah mengambil perlengkapan mandi di hotel mana pun kecuali jika saya sudah mulai menggunakannya. Sebenarnya saya membawa perlengkapan mandi sendiri karena biasanya di sebagian besar hotel, fasilitasnya di bawah standar (bahkan hotel bintang 5). Meskipun perlengkapan mandi di kamar ini agak besar - tetapi tidak lebih besar dari Bulgari atau merek serupa di Bellagio Suites atau Caesars Suites. Terutama di masa pandemi, saya juga berasumsi bahwa semua yang tidak diperbaiki akan dibuang. Saya menerima pesan WhatsApp saat tiba di rumah, bahwa hotel akan mengenakan biaya US$ 50 per botol yang saya ambil. Padahal, selama saya menginap di sana, saya 'bisa' saja menggunakan semua perlengkapan mandi, yang berarti hotel hanya akan memiliki 6 botol yang mungkin bernilai US$ 1 dalam produksi? Saya akan mengembalikannya saat kembali ke Jakarta minggu depan. Sungguh lelucon… 3 hari kemudian - saya diminta untuk memberikan ulasan tentang pengalaman menginap saya oleh Accor. Pertanyaan spesifiknya adalah apa pendapat saya tentang perlengkapan mandi yang sekarang diletakkan di dispenser demi tujuan keberlanjutan? Saya berasumsi bahwa yang saya bawa adalah dispenser yang saya kira berisi perlengkapan mandi. Seandainya staf hotel mengkomunikasikan hal ini atau ada catatan di kamar mandi bahwa ini adalah 'dispenser' yang hanya boleh digunakan di dalam hotel, tentu saja saya akan meninggalkannya di sana."
"477.","Nathania Hermawan Liem","22","2022-01-21","1","Kalau ada bintang 0,5, saya pasti akan beri bintang 0,5. Saat ini saya menginap di Raffles Hotel Jakarta (di kamar Suite) selama karantina 10 hari, dan pelayanannya selalu buruk. Makan siang saya hari ini tidak datang tepat waktu, dan petugas layanan menyalahkan kami karena tidak menentukan waktu makan siang yang tepat. Dan ketika kami menindaklanjuti untuk makan siang, mereka terus meminta kami menunggu 20 menit lagi, dan sekarang kami masih menunggu makan siang. Pelayanannya buruk. Kamarnya sendiri bagus, tetapi pelayanannya buruk. Mungkin saya tidak akan merekomendasikan siapa pun untuk menginap di sini."

Saya melapor, dan staf meninggalkan catatan di kamar saya yang menyatakan bahwa mereka telah membersihkan kamar saya. Hari ke-2: Saya bangun, berjalan perlahan menuju kamar mandi, lalu tiba-tiba kaki kanan saya tertusuk logam seperti tombak yang mencuat dari bangku patah di kaki tempat tidur saya. Saya melapor. Staf meminta maaf, mengganti bangku, dan meninggalkan sebotol Betadine di kamar saya. Manajemen baru datang untuk meminta maaf pada hari ke-4, menawarkan peningkatan kamar pada malam sebelum saya check-out, tetapi saya menolaknya dengan sopan. Hari ke-5: Saya check-out pukul 5 pagi dan masih menemukan kecoa di kamar mandi. Logam tajam yang menusuk kaki saya, belum lagi kecoa, merupakan masalah kesehatan, keselamatan, dan jaminan kualitas yang serius. Manajer umum baru mengirim email kepada saya 5 hari setelah kejadian untuk meminta maaf, membuat saya banyak bertanya tentang hotel ini. Bekas luka tersebut masih ada di kaki saya sampai sekarang."

Tempat strategis, fasilitas maksimal terlebih lagi dengan adanya connecting passage ke mall ciputra. Pelayanan selama ini cukup baik, tapi baru hari ini Senin June 9th, 2025 saya merasakan adanya diskriminasi pelayanan antara orang asing dengan lokal oleh waitress wanita di coffee shopnya. Klien saya yang WNA dilayani dengan ramah sementara saya WNI diperlakukan dengan ketus? Why? So weird. Jauh lebih ramah satpam yang jaga pintu gerbang dan metal detector, trully 5 star hotel hospitality. Sementara bagian yang harusnya memberikan hospitality malah hostile, wangat meninggalkan kesan yang buruk untuk saya. Semoga bisa diperbaiki."

"557.","Arya 1810","5","2024-01-21","2","Ulasan The Dining Room Saya makan malam Natal di sini, jadi saya akan mulai dengan bagian-bagian yang bagus. Konsep dapurnya terbuka, yang bagus, meskipun ada kolom besar yang menghalangi pandangan saya sehingga saya tidak bisa melihat dapur sepenuhnya. Saya melihat tamu masuk ke dapur dan mengambil foto serta video. Saya tidak tahu kalau kami diizinkan melakukan itu, kalau tidak, saya ingin sekali masuk dan melihat cara kerja para koki. Pelayanannya cukup baik dan pelayan utama kami sangat perhatian dan menjelaskan hidangan sebelum disajikan. Jadi, saya sangat suka padanya. Keluhan utama saya adalah tentang makanannya. Pertama-tama, saya pecinta kuliner, sebenarnya saya pecinta kuliner super dan saya juga bekerja di industri jasa makanan. Es krim salmon yang diawetkan, mengingatkan pada es krim tartar salmon French Laundry. Saya mengharapkan salmon yang diawetkan dan dibumbui dengan baik, mungkin dengan sedikit bumbu karena proses pengawetan dapat memberikan rasa tersebut. Tapi rasanya seperti sashimi salmon dalam es krim renyah. Saya sangat menghargai penyajiannya, mengingatkan saya pada kornet tartar salmon French Laundry yang terkenal. Foie gras 3 cara, meskipun teksturnya enak dari ketiga hidangan mini foie gras, saya merasa rasa foie grasnya sangat hambar dan bumbunya sangat terbatas. Tapi mungkin memang sudah seharusnya begini, saya pikir mungkin selera pribadi saya yang kurang menyukainya. Chestnut velouté memiliki irisan truffle segar, dan saya mengharapkan aroma truffle bunga dan rasa yang lezat dalam supnya. Tapi sekali lagi, rasa truffle segar yang diiris tidak ada. Hidangan ini dibumbui dengan baik dan ini menunjukkan betapa mengecewakan dan kurang bumbunya hidangan sebelumnya menurut saya. Lalu seabass, ini adalah hidangan favorit saya malam itu, dari tekstur yang sempurna hingga bumbu yang pas, dan komposisi hidangan secara keseluruhan sangat baik. Tapi kalkun sous vide, meskipun tidak kering, lagi-lagi ada masalah bumbu pada dagingnya. Saus dan kompotnya menambah sedikit rasa pada kalkun, yang sebenarnya dagingnya cukup membosankan. Saya baca di menu kalau kalkun ini disajikan dengan kubis Brussel. Saya suka kubis Brussel dan sudah menantikannya, tapi yang disajikan hanya lima helai daun kubis Brussel utuh yang tampak menyedihkan…. Esensi kubis Brussel berasal dari seluruh kubis Brussel, dari sedikit rasa pahit pada daunnya hingga tekstur dan rasa tanah yang dekat dengan inti kubis Brussel, bukan hanya dari beberapa helai daun yang mentah. Rasanya terlalu berlebihan. Hidangan ini membuat saya yang sering makan di restoran mewah kesal dan saya jadi tidak ingin menghabiskannya. Rasanya seperti melewatkan satu demi satu hidangan, ketika hidangan penutup datang, saya sudah tidak ingin makan lagi, terutama karena saya tidak suka rasa kopi yang kuat pada es krim kopinya. Tapi ini bukan salah kokinya, ini hanya karena saya tidak suka kopi dan es krim secara bersamaan. Penyajian hidangan penutupnya sangat sempurna dan banyak pertimbangan yang saya curahkan untuk membuatnya. Terakhir, praline-nya. Meskipun rasanya enak, kulit praline-nya lembut dan tidak seperti yang biasa saya makan. Umumnya, saat membuat praline, kulitnya harus terbuat dari cokelat tempered, dan tandanya adalah teksturnya yang renyah saat digigit. Meskipun kulitnya tipis, teksturnya tetap renyah. Biasanya, Natal adalah waktu di mana kita bisa menikmati pengalaman kuliner yang luar biasa, tetapi ini bukan saatnya. Sebagai kesimpulan, saya meninggalkan restoran dengan perasaan cukup kesal dan kecewa dengan pengalaman kulinernya, jelas bukan yang saya harapkan dari restoran sekelas ini. Satu-satunya hal yang menyenangkan adalah saya bisa menghabiskan waktu bersama orang tua kami di restoran yang nyaman pada Malam Natal."

Selain itu, hotel ini menjadi terlalu berisik karena jalan raya. Fleksibilitasnya pun sudah tidak setara dengan hotel bintang 5. Mengapa hanya bintang 2? Mengingat hotel ini memang masih layak mendapat peringkat bintang 5, sayangnya layanan dan kualitasnya sudah tidak ada lagi, dan harganya sudah naik dua kali lipat. Saya rasa layanan bintang 5 di sini sudah tidak ada lagi."
"559.","Kevin Beutler","63","2022-01-21","2","Saya tidak merekomendasikan hotel ini untuk karantina. Mereka tidak membersihkan kamar dan bahkan tidak mengizinkan Anda menghirup udara segar selama 5 menit, meskipun Anda terbukti mengalami masalah pernapasan. Layanan kamar hampir selalu lupa sesuatu dan tidak mengubah apa pun, meskipun Anda berkomunikasi dengan jelas. Anda mungkin berpikir bahwa di hotel bintang 5, waktu Anda akan senyaman mungkin, tetapi ternyata tidak. Tentu saja, ini hotel yang bagus dibandingkan dengan yang lain, tetapi nilai uangnya sama sekali tidak ada."
"560.","Ahmed","119","2024-01-21","2","Jujur saja, hotelnya mewah dan pelayanannya luar biasa, tapi ada dua kekurangannya: sarapannya (semoga Allah mengabadikan keberkahan kita) dan kebisingan jalan. Kami tidak bisa tidur selama dua hari. Suara mobil sama kerasnya dengan suara di dalam kamar, meskipun kami berada di lantai 21. Kami meminta untuk menunda check-out agar bisa tidur dua jam sebelum penerbangan, tetapi mereka menolak! Sejujurnya, saya sama sekali tidak merekomendasikannya, dan harganya sama sekali tidak sepadan, karena insulasinya tidak ada!"

Ada lalat beterbangan di sana-sini. Dan testimoni dari kedua mempelai tentang layanan dan perlakuan hotel terhadap mereka sangat buruk. Mereka pasti tidak akan merekomendasikan hotel ini kepada teman-teman mereka untuk pernikahan. Saya terkejut karena saya pernah ke sini untuk pernikahan sebelum pandemi dan hasilnya lumayan.

Saya ditawarkan dibuatkan omelet, saya mengiyakan, tp sudah 30 menit tidak datang2, pada saat 15 menit menunggu saya tanya omelet saya mana dijawab dicek dulu, oke, tp sampai 30 menit tidak datang2, padahal restoran tidak terlalu ramai, teman saya jg minta dibuatkan waffle demikian, jd terpaksa sarapan yang lain. Kalau gt jgn ditawarkan dibuatkan omelet jd tidak menunggu dan tidak datang. Apa SOP membuat omelet lebih dari 30 menit? kemudian Saya merasa dibedakan dari tamu asing yg pelayanannya cepat (meja sebelah), ini rasis apa gmn ya? Terima kasih."

Tp menurut saya, budget start 1.2M/1000 pax di ruangan besar dengan dekorasi meVVah ini sama aja dgn hotel lain dibawah budget 1M, hanya indoor sayang banget. Kebetulan konsep bride adalah makanan vegetarian, enak bumbunya meresap mgk krn menu ini jarang disediakan byk hotel, tp utk selebihnya terasa biasa saja, cm menang prestise lokasi selatan yg elit. Ketika pulang, krn menunggu lama keluarga membagikan makanan sy tny ke manajer pria yg tugas lupa name tagnya, dia bilang boleh 1-2 gelas puding jd sy bawa 12 buah lgs dia bilang lg gk boleh krn gelas kaca mahal. Sy tny mempelai ingin bawa gmn? Jwbnya: Ya dikorek krn gelasnya mahal! Masa ya ud byr M-M puding gelas kaca 10rb gk boleh dibawa pulang, manajerny jg gk tau ada toko makanan yg menjual produk serupa dgn gelas kaca malah tanya sy dimana ?

"591.","Kayla Kayla","32","2024-01-21","3","Pelayanan restoran saat makan pagi perlu ditingkatkan lagi untuk seluruh staff terutama waiter/waitress. Untuk 5 star hotel etiquette nya sangat kurang. Sempat beberapa kali mendengar karyawan membentak saat berbicara dgn tamu. Dan kalau tamu minta sesuatu staff yg melayani ngomong kencang ke staff lainnya untuk diambilkan 😅 kayak di warung. that doesnt look professional at all. Bisa lah mendekat ke staff tersebut. Kesannya spt malas. Choice of food is okay, nothing extraordinary. I expected more actually. Other than that mulai dari check in and rooms is perfect. Just the restaurant staff needs more work."

Lalu saya komplain ke butler service via whatsapp, alasannya keamanan. Such an unreasonable excuse ! anak saya sudah cukup dewasa untuk tahu mana alat yang berbahaya dan nggak, apalagi ada saya yang menemani, dan anak saya cuma mau treadmill. Lalu saya cek ke website , instagram dan guide yang ada di TV hotel sama sekali tidak disebutkan syarat umur minimal 16 tahun untuk memakai gym.

Di hari yg sama, tim f&b melalui whatsapp meminta saya utk transfer DP sebesar Rp 500.000,- dan saya lakukan. 17/04/2023 - Tim f&b menghubungi saya melalui WA dan memindahkan reservasi saya ke Arts Cafe dgn alasan Nusantara HARUS TUTUP di tanggal reservasi saya tanpa memberikan penjelasan kenapa harus tutup. - Menurut saya, tindakan tersebut kurang profesional apalagi untuk hotel sekelas Raffles. Kenapa saya harus segera transfer dp, tetapi dalam waktu kurang dari 24 jam langsung dipindah ke Arts dengan alasan Nusantara HARUS TUTUP tanpa saya diberikan alasan kenapa tutup. Kenapa tidak info dari sebelum minta DP dari saya? 19/04/2023 - Keluarga saya datang jam 19, langsung memesan steak dan bone marrow di show kitchen dan dijawab Bone marrow nya sudah habis, Bu. Sekelas restoran buffet hotel raffles dgn kondisi tidak full jam 19 sudah kehabisan makanan? - Saya meminta tambahan steak di jam 19.30, salah satu pelayan bilang Bu, ini terakhir ya soalnya sudah habis.. Mengecewakan sekali. Baru jam 19.30 dan ini sekelas buffet hotel bintang 5 sudah kehabisan makanan. - Saya komplain ke salah satu staff dan akhirnya Chef menghampiri table kami dan berusaha menjelaskan. Menu2 yg tadinya habis dan ini terakhir ya bu.. mendadak bisa jadi ada semua setelah Chef ke meja kami. Alasannya tadi sedang stok opname. Semakin tidak masuk akal. 🤔 Menurut saya, cake nya semua enak, tapi variasi menu buffet hari ini kurang menarik, makanan di buffet tidak di refill kalau tidak ada komplain, dan piring kotor tidak diangkat kalau tamu tidak manggil pelayan, dan pernyataan makanan habis dan tidak bisa nambah sangat membuat kami jengkel. Saat close bill, greeter meminta feedback dari kami dan saya jelaskan mengenai yg apa2 habis tadi. Dan saya mendengar dari table dekat kami juga kasih feedback yang kurang lebih sama, yaitu kok steak nya bisa-bisanya habis.. **** UPDATE 21/04/2023 Manajer F&B telah menghubungi saya untuk klarifikasi. Really appreciate the gesture. 👍 ****"

"638.","Ed Joe","9","2025-12-21","3","Saya belum pernah merasa begitu tidak nyaman di hotel 'mewah'. Saya menginap 4 malam di Raffles Jakarta dan merasa tidak nyaman – bukan karena fasilitasnya, tetapi karena cara hotel memperlakukan tamunya. Pertama, cucian saya tidak diantar tepat waktu sesuai kesepakatan dan tidak ada yang menjelaskan apa yang terjadi. Ketika saya bertanya di resepsionis, saya diberitahu bahwa tim laundry tidak mau mengirimkannya karena saya belum meninggalkan deposit dan mereka khawatir saya tidak akan membayar. Untuk hotel sekelas ini, penanganan seperti ini terasa sangat tidak profesional dan tidak perlu. Kedua, saya meminta 10 kotak kecil cotton bud karena saya sering menggunakannya (perawatan kulit, makeup, membersihkan) dan lebih suka meminta sekali daripada menelepon berkali-kali. Bahkan setelah saya menjelaskan hal ini, manajer yang bertugas tampak sangat enggan dan, pada akhirnya, hanya mengirimkan 5 kotak. Ini barang kecil, tetapi cara penanganannya membuat saya merasa hotel terlalu curiga terhadap tamu yang meminta fasilitas dasar. Saya sudah menginap di banyak hotel mewah di seluruh dunia, dan saya belum pernah mengalami tingkat ketidakpercayaan seperti ini dari sebuah properti. Berdasarkan pengalaman menginap ini, saya tidak akan merekomendasikan Raffles Jakarta. ——12/12 (Disunting)—— Namun, semua staf lainnya cukup ramah. Dan sarapannya benar-benar enak."
"639.","Muhammad Athallah Arsyaf","73","2025-11-21","3","Saya sudah dua kali ke Raffles, dalam dua kesempatan berbeda. Sayangnya, untuk kedua kunjungan tersebut, saya BUKAN tamu yang menginap, jadi saya tidak bisa berkomentar tentang suite atau pengalaman menginap secara keseluruhan. Saya berasumsi bahwa suite-nya patut dicontoh karena saya hanya mendengar ulasan positif dari orang-orang yang pernah menginap di sini sebelumnya. Saya ingin berkomentar tentang pengalaman MICE yang saya alami di sini. Saya menghadiri kongres medis di Raffles dan tentu saja saya memiliki ekspektasi yang sangat tinggi. Saya tidak memiliki keluhan tentang tempatnya, karena dekorasi yang sangat apik dengan karya-karya Hendra Gunawan tentu saja membuat Raffles menonjol dibandingkan properti mewah lainnya di Jakarta. Namun sayangnya, pengalaman bersantap prasmanan di kedua kunjungan saya agak mengecewakan. Soal rasa, selalu ada yang kurang memuaskan. Beberapa makanannya enak, tetapi tidak ada yang istimewa. Harus saya akui, hidangan penutupnya sempurna. Keluhan lain yang saya miliki adalah tentang pengendalian keramaian. Paviliun di luar ballroom penuh sesak dengan orang-orang. Ruang geraknya sempit dan antrean makanan sangat panjang. Perputaran makanan juga sangat cepat ketika distribusi dimulai terlambat. Jadi, bahkan sebelum pukul 13.00, makanan sudah diantar. Ini berarti tidak ada porsi kedua. Sayang sekali. Yang terpenting adalah keramahannya. Dua kali saya ke sini, stafnya sama sekali tidak ramah. Wajar saja, orang Indonesia sangat murah hati dengan senyum dan sapaan mereka, tetapi Anda tidak akan menemukan ini di Raffles. Pertama kali saya ke sana pada tahun 2021, saya ingat bagaimana penjaga pintu bahkan tidak melihat wajah kami saat keluar, dan itu masih membekas di ingatan saya sampai sekarang. Anehnya, bahkan di tahun 2025, hal ini tidak banyak berubah. Saya hanya berinteraksi dengan salah satu petugas dapur, menanyakan apakah masih ada makanan tersisa, dan tanggapan yang saya dapatkan tidak terlalu ramah maupun profesional. Tentu saja bukan sesuatu yang Anda harapkan dari merek yang sangat dihargai. Sayang sekali karena menurut saya layanan dari orang-orang adalah yang terpenting dalam industri ini. Saya tidak mengerti apakah mereka menilai tamu berdasarkan penampilan atau apa, tetapi saya agak kecewa dengan kurangnya perhatian yang ditunjukkan staf Raffles kepada tamu yang tidak menginap."
"640.","Theresia novianty","7","2025-12-21","3","Saya selalu menyukai Raffles Hotel karena privasinya dan lokasinya yang strategis, tetapi pengalaman menginap saya baru-baru ini sangat tidak menyenangkan dan bahkan menakutkan. Saat saya sedang beristirahat di kamar, seorang staf tiba-tiba masuk tanpa izin. Mereka membunyikan bel pintu tiga kali, tetapi sebelum saya sempat menjawab, pintu terbuka, dan mereka masuk saat saya sedang tidur. Saya terbangun karena suara pintu terbuka, yang sangat mengejutkan dan sama sekali tidak dapat diterima. Ketika saya bertanya kepada staf mengapa mereka memasuki kamar saya tanpa izin, mereka mengatakan bahwa mereka sedang menawarkan jasa kebersihan. Kejadian ini terjadi sekitar pukul 20.00, waktu di mana jam malam biasanya mengharuskan saya mengetuk pintu atau menawarkan jasa kebersihan. Seluruh pengalaman itu sangat aneh dan mengkhawatirkan saya. Terima kasih."

Kekurangan: Lokasinya jauh dari mana-mana, tidak seperti Pullman yang dekat dengan segalanya. Tidak ada air mengalir di kamar; mereka hanya menyediakan dispenser air dan menolak untuk membawakan yang lain. Semua yang ada di minibar dikenakan biaya tambahan, tidak seperti hotel mewah lainnya di Bali dan Jakarta. Hotel ini sudah tua meskipun mewah."
"644.","Deepti Shinh","366","2025-06-21","3","Secara keseluruhan, pengalaman merayakan ulang tahun pernikahan kami di sini sangat mengecewakan. Kami menginap satu malam. Kami mendapat kejutan menyenangkan di kamar dengan ucapan selamat ulang tahun dan kue yang indah. Kamarnya sendiri luas dan indah dengan pemandangan kota yang menakjubkan. Hotelnya sendiri menakjubkan dengan karya seni dan dekorasi yang indah. Kolam renangnya indah dan kami menyukai jacuzzi-nya. Agak dingin di kolam renang hampir sepanjang waktu karena bangunan-bangunan menutupi sinar matahari. Gym-nya fantastis! Kami pergi minum ke bar mereka pukul 2 siang dan mereka tidak menawarkan menu alkohol kepada kami. Ketika kami secara khusus memintanya dan kemudian meminta minuman khas dari menu tersebut, kami diberitahu bahwa itu tidak tersedia karena ahli mixologi tidak ada dan akan datang pukul 4 sore. Kami pergi lagi untuk minum sebelum makan malam, mendengarkan musik live yang indah dan lagi-lagi minuman khas yang saya inginkan tidak tersedia! Saya memesan margherita sederhana dan mereka mengenakan harga yang lebih mahal daripada harga minuman khas mereka! Banyak minuman seperti bir di menu tidak tersedia. Makanan bar hambar dan biasa-biasa saja. Sangat mengecewakan. Kami keluar untuk makan malam lebih awal dan kembali ke hotel. Kami berdua merasa sangat lapar sekitar pukul 23.30 dan memesan satu-satunya pizza daging yang ada di menu layanan kamar 24/7 mereka, tetapi 15 menit kemudian mereka memberi tahu saya bahwa pizza tersebut tidak tersedia! Saat kami check-out, kami bahkan tidak ditanya bagaimana pengalaman menginap kami... sepertinya mereka tidak menginginkan umpan balik atau tidak cukup peduli untuk mengetahui apakah kami menikmati masa menginap kami atau tidak. Kami pernah menginap di Raffles di negara lain dan sejauh ini ini adalah pengalaman yang paling mengecewakan. Secara keseluruhan terasa lebih seperti hotel bisnis."
"645.","Hendrawan Daryono Karso","1","2025-05-21","3","Menginap di sini untuk perjalanan bisnis singkat. Hotelnya bersih dan stafnya sopan, tetapi saya mendapatkan pengalaman mengecewakan yang memengaruhi keseluruhan masa inap. Saya diberitahu bahwa sandal yang disediakan hotel tidak diperbolehkan di area sarapan. Karena saya hanya memakai sepatu formal dan mengira sandal kamar bisa dipakai untuk sarapan cepat, hal ini cukup mengejutkan. Kebijakan ini tidak disebutkan saat check-in atau di informasi kamar. Untuk hotel dengan kisaran harga ini, hal ini terasa sangat merepotkan dan bisa dihindari — terutama bagi tamu yang menginap singkat."
"646.","michelle agatha","43","2025-03-21","3","Tempatnya bagus, suasananya juga bagus. Tapi menurut saya pelayanannya tidak seperti hotel bintang 5. Stafnya kurang ramah. Saya pergi ke kamar mandi kolam renang (ya, sudah larut malam sekitar jam 7 malam) dan sangat berantakan. Seperti yang terlihat di gambar: - kondisionernya kosong dan saya tidak tahu siapa yang membuka dispensernya. - saluran pembuangan lantai penuh rambut dan airnya tidak langsung dialirkan. - wastafelnya juga banyak rambut rontok. Penjaga kolam renang jarang terlihat di stasiun, saya tidak tahu harus menghubungi siapa."
"647.","강수지","1","2025-03-21","3","Menginap di Raffles Jakarta bersama adik saya sungguh pengalaman yang luar biasa, sampai ia bercerita bahwa salah satu pelayan sarapan berbicara dalam bahasa Tagalog, menilai penampilan kami, dan berpikir kami mungkin tidak mengerti apa yang ia bicarakan. Selebihnya, pengalaman menginap kami memuaskan."
"648.","Lorraine Tolentino","2","2025-01-21","3","Stafnya ramah, tapi kami kehilangan sedikit uang di dalam kamar. Mereka sudah menyelidiki dan tidak menemukan siapa pun yang bersalah. Sayang sekali karena kami sudah menghitung uangnya sebelum meninggalkan kamar. Hanya saja kami tidak menyangka ada yang membersihkan kamar sepagi ini saat kami sedang sarapan di Arts Cafe. Secara keseluruhan, hotel ini masih bagus, tapi jangan tinggalkan uang Anda di dalam kamar."
"649.","MRN90 L","20","2024-01-21","3","Kamarnya tidak megah. Sangat mengecewakan. Sangat biasa saja, seperti hotel bintang 4 lainnya. Fasilitas yang disediakan tidak sesuai dengan harga. Prasmanan makan malamnya murahan; lebih baik menghabiskan uang di tempat lain yang lebih bagus. Pelayanannya biasa saja, maksud saya untuk hotel bintang 5, itu memang pantas. Saya tidak akan merekomendasikan menginap di sini, tetapi di tempat lain yang lebih bagus seperti Park Hyatt, Langham, atau Grand Hyatt."
"650.","Esam Al Sayed","87","2024-01-21","3","Hotel yang bagus untuk menginap, tetapi pertimbangkan hal berikut: 1. Staf di resepsionis, restoran, dan ruang layanan lambat. Terkadang permintaan Anda mungkin terlupakan. Beberapa pengecualian. 2. Jangan memesan kamar dengan pemandangan jalan. Hotel ini TIDAK memiliki sistem kedap suara. Meskipun Anda memesan di lantai atas, kebisingan di malam hari tidak akan membuat Anda tidur! Dijamin. 3. Layanan laundry dan setrika membutuhkan waktu yang sangat lama. Pastikan Anda memesan layanan ini SEHARI sebelumnya! 3."
"651.","pepperidge farm","1153","2024-01-21","3","Terakhir kali minum-minum seru dengan teman-teman di sini, dan sudah lama sekali sampai hari ini. Saya berencana memesan kafe mereka untuk merayakan hari istimewa kami melalui WA dengan tim penjualan FNB mereka. Waktu itu di hari cerah biasa, sekitar pukul 15.00, jadi sepertinya bukan jam sibuk, tapi... Ternyata layanan dan komunikasi hotel bintang 5 ini yang paling buruk yang pernah saya alami. Saya menghabiskan 1,5 jam untuk komunikasi bolak-balik, responsnya sangat lambat, butuh 5 menit untuk menjawab pertanyaan saya, padahal pertanyaan saya hanya dasar dan tidak ada di katalog mereka, sama sekali tidak tahu produk mereka, bahkan foto yang saya minta pun diteruskan oleh orang lain, sama sekali tidak efisien, seperti mengobrol dengan chatbot. Karena waktu yang terbuang dan semua interaksi yang saya alami, saya mulai kehilangan minat untuk memesan layanan mereka. Saya tidak pernah percaya Raffles di cabang ini seburuk ini. —————————————————————— Revisi peringkat: Meskipun semua perlakuan selama pertanyaan, kami tetap memilih tempat ini untuk acara kami. Komunikasi berjalan lebih baik setelah saya menghubungi kontak mereka yang saya dapatkan dari acara pernikahan. Selama acara, staf menangani semuanya dengan lancar dan profesional. Layanan yang diberikan adalah bintang 5. Berdasarkan semua pengalaman yang kami alami, peringkat layanan ditetapkan menjadi 3 (1 untuk sebelum penjualan dan 5 untuk selama acara)."
"652.","Yiran","27","2025-12-24","3","Sarapannya sangat buruk."
"653.","Steve 1492","10","2024-01-21","3","Semua baik-baik saja sampai check-in, mungkin sedikit terlalu perhatian dan agak menyeramkan. Mereka ingin mengambil foto paspor kami. Ini bukan persyaratan hukum. Hanya nomor paspor dan nama yang diperlukan untuk catatan pemerintah, sisanya sama sekali tidak dapat diterima. Untuk layanan bintang 5, ini sangat buruk. Staf check-in menyebut anak kami sebagai anak kecil! Bahasa yang tepat untuk tempat usaha kelas atas adalah wanita atau pria muda, tuan atau nona muda. Kamar mengalami perawatan berkualitas buruk di tempat-tempat yang sangat jelas. Tisu toilet satu lapis!!!! 1 stopkontak USB di seluruh suite 2 kamar! Salah satu dudukan lampu kamar tidur yang serasi miring (bengkok) beberapa derajat (kurang memperhatikan detail). Tidak yakin bagaimana mereka berhasil mendapatkan 5 bintang? Kebisingan lalu lintas terus-menerus meskipun jendela berkaca ganda. Anda juga dapat mendengar semuanya dari lantai atas dan bawah."
"654.","M F","104","2024-01-21","3","Mengingat saya anggota Accord Diamond, saya tidak mendapatkan fasilitas check-in awal, check-in terlambat, upgrade, atau fasilitas lainnya. Hotelnya sendiri tidak buruk, tetapi jika tidak tahu cara memperlakukan tamu VIP dengan baik, sebaiknya jangan kembali."
"655.","John Agosta","81","2022-01-21","3","Properti itu sendiri sangat mewah. Ada banyak kemewahan & glamor bintang 5. Menurut pendapat saya, hal itu meninggalkan kehangatan dalam keramahtamahan, perhatian dalam sikap, dan substansi untuk makanan & minuman. Saya pernah makan lebih baik di hotel bintang 3 & 4. Kualitas makanan mengecewakan & tidak memuaskan dalam banyak aspek. Layanan mereka kurang berkilau & sikap profesional tingkat tinggi. Untuk hotel dengan biaya setinggi itu, mereka dapat lebih memfokuskan detail pada manajemen F&B mereka. Keamanan tidak ramah & menakutkan. Ini bisa menjadi hotel yang pengap tetapi berkelas, namun saya merasa kadang-kadang staf mereka bisa canggung tidak memperhatikan, seolah-olah mereka berpikir pelanggan ada untuk mereka, alih-alih mempertimbangkan kebutuhan kami. Sekali lagi, tempatnya indah & nyaman tetapi sebagian besar & banyak hidangan biasa-biasa saja dan pas-pasan. Karena makannya, saya tidak akan menilai hotel ini, di Top10 Jakarta."
"656.","Kulkasterbang","419","2023-01-21","3","Saya tidak menginap di sini, jadi saya tidak bisa berkomentar tentang kamarnya. Saya hanya menghadiri sebuah acara. Stafnya ramah dan baik. Makanan di acaranya lumayan. Tidak ada yang istimewa. Saya tidak suka hotel ini karena tidak ada tempat parkir untuk sepeda motor. Saya harus parkir di luar hotel. Sungguh diskriminasi bagi pengunjung roda dua."
"657.","Edwin Rene","412","2019-01-21","3","Saya datang ke sini untuk menghadiri konferensi Google CloudOnBoard yang diadakan di area konferensi lantai 11. Area ini sudah penuh karena ada 1000 orang yang berpartisipasi. Tempat parkirnya buruk, bukan karena tidak ada tempat parkir, tetapi karena desain keseluruhan dan jalur yang sangat sempit. Makanannya enak, dan saya salut untuk para pelayan yang sangat profesional, mereka sangat membantu dan penuh perhatian. Selain itu, menurut saya tempatnya lumayan. Lokasinya dekat dengan Lotte Avenue, jadi sangat strategis."
"658.","Nongki Darapati","37","2019-01-21","3","Tidak sesuai dengan reputasi hotel yang menawarkan undian. Kamar terasa biasa saja. Sofa terlalu keras. Makanan tidak sepadan dengan harganya. Saya memesan nasi ayam hainan, tapi ayamnya kering dan baunya tidak enak. Saya memesan makaroni, juga mengecewakan, sangat kering. Dapur di kamar suite tidak berfungsi, mungkin lebih baik dijadikan minibar. Ada wastafel dapur, tetapi tidak ada peralatan makan dan minum. Hanya ada beberapa cangkir, gelas, dan sendok teh. Secara keseluruhan, saya kecewa."
"659.","Aditya","108","2022-01-21","3","Hotel ini terletak di lokasi strategis di pusat kota Jakarta, dan menurut saya interiornya bernuansa Timur Tengah. Raja Salman dari Arab Saudi juga pernah menginap di hotel ini selama kunjungannya. Harga kamarnya agak mahal. Ada mal yang terhubung sehingga Anda bisa berbelanja tanpa perlu keluar kompleks."
"660.","sano suke","100","2020-01-21","3","Mungkin karena keterbatasan ruang, hotel ini tidak menyediakan tempat parkir sepeda motor. Anda dapat memarkir sepeda motor Anda di luar tempat parkir pihak ketiga hotel. Mungkin juga tidak ada ruang khusus untuk pertemuan teknologi besar dengan lingkungan listrik untuk setiap pengguna (mengunjungi salah satu vendor acara cloud)."
"661.","aryo nugroho","966","2020-01-21","3","Saya menginap di hotel ini untuk konferensi satu hari. Aulanya mewah, dihiasi lukisan dan mural. Desainnya bagus, tapi saya merasa kecewa dengan pelayanannya. Agak lambat dan kurang responsif."
"662.","Santhy Prahayuningtyas","5","2022-01-21","3","Kamarnya bagus...tapi pelayanan saat sarapan kurang baik..pesanan omelet dan teh tidak pernah keluar meskipun sudah meminta pelayan dua kali..lain kali lebih baik ya"
"663.","S. B.","187","2020-01-21","3","Kopi dan espresso tanpa kue. Tidak ada sandwich di bar lobi. Hummus tersedia di menu dengan roti, tetapi disajikan dengan keripik renyah. Pelayan membawakan Coca-Cola yang salah :("
