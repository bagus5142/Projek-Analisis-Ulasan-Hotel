"2.","Glendon Thaiw","23","2025-12-04","5","I travel to Jakarta nearly every month for work, and The Hermitage is, without a doubt, my 100% go-to hotel. It truly feels like a home away from home. While the entire hotel is exquisite, the Restaurant and Lounge services stand out for their quality and comforting atmosphere. The food is always excellent, and the service is consistently warm and efficient. The absolute highlight of my monthly visits is the exceptional service provided by Silmi. Her genuine warmth, positive energy, and commitment to making every guest feel welcome are outstanding. I truly look forward to seeing her every time I return. Thank you, Silmi, and the entire Hermitage team, for making my stays so wonderful!"
"3.","Luthfiana Rahma","31","2025-12-01","3","For a non-smoker, this hotel is very uncomfortable. The lobby even has hint of cigarettes smell that has been staining for a long time. This makes me uncomfortable in the lobby since the waiting time takes so long since because of scattered queuing line for checking in. They do not have proper area for checking in and queuing. The staff at my check-in time did not give proper treatment for me who have been waiting for long while standing. They serve people who comes first to the table, not people who comes first. This makes me quite annoyed. The reception also handle the luggage which should be all handled by the concierge. Another disappointed part is the resto which is so compact (small) hence it only has low variety of foods. Actually the food is quite good, but the crowds are not. Sometimes the hint of smell of cigarettes enters the restaurant. For meeting room, they only offer 2 kinds of snacks with fruits and coffee. Not too bad, just standard. For room, the room is OK to be honest, you will have separated living room, which makes it more private in the bed area."
"4.","Model Citizen","25","2025-12-01","5","From the moment we walked into The Hermitage, we knew we were in for something special. The breakfast service was outstanding. The staff greeted us warmly each morning, offering helpful suggestions and making sure our coffee refills were prompt. The spread was impressive: fresh fruit, beautifully cooked eggs, and pastries that didn’t just look great, but tasted fantastic. Dinner at 1928 was equally memorable. The dining room staff struck the perfect balance of attentive and unobtrusive — knowing when to check on us and when to give us space to savor the meal. Every course was delivered with care: plating was elegant, portions generous, and flavors consistently excellent. One evening in particular, the staff went out of their way to accommodate a special request, doing so with grace and genuine friendliness. It wasn’t just about the food — the ambiance is inviting and relaxed, yet refined enough to make each meal feel like a treat. Clean linens, soft lighting, and a calm, welcoming atmosphere made dinner feel like a special occasion. What stood out most was the people: polite, friendly, and professional without being stuffy. They made us feel not just like customers, but like valued guests — something that’s rare and wonderful to experience. In short: Dining Room 1928 delivers superb food, polished service, and an all-around warm, inviting vibe. If you care about being treated with kindness and eating well, this place is a must. ★★★★★"
"5.","Lestari Prihandayani","6","2025-11-01","5","The Hermitage Menteng feels like a serene hidden gem in the middle of Jakarta, elegant, quiet, and thoughtfully curated. The room is exceptionally spacious and beautifully maintained, offering both comfort and a sense of calm the moment you step inside. Breakfast was a lovely experience; the Norwegian smoked salmon was fresh and flavorful, and the cappuccino was rich and perfectly balanced, a wonderful start to the morning. The restaurant staff were genuinely warm and attentive, which created a heartfelt connection beyond service alone. Another standout detail was the toiletries, the fragrance of the shampoo, conditioner, and body wash carries a refined Indonesian signature scent, gentle, comforting, and luxurious. A stay that leaves a lasting impression, not only because of its beauty, but because it makes you feel genuinely cared for. A perfect urban sanctuary ✨✨✨"
"6.","lancar jayadi sutanto","17","2025-11-01","5","I had a truly wonderful breakfast experience at The Hermitage, a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, Jakarta. While I was having breakfast, I was kindly approached by Chef Heru, who noticed that I wasn’t eating much. He asked with genuine concern whether the food wasn’t to my liking or if something could be improved. I explained that during my stay, the breakfast menu hadn’t changed much, so I was starting to feel a bit bored. To my surprise, Chef Heru immediately offered to prepare something off the menu for the next day — and he personally made me a special dish: Grilled Spicy Oxtail Beef with rice and soup. It was absolutely delicious! Unfortunately, I forgot to take a photo, but honestly, if this dish ever becomes a permanent menu item, it would definitely be a hit. Two of my friends also tried it on different days and loved it just as much. Excellent service and genuine hospitality from Chef Heru! 🥰🙏 Thank you so much, Chef — you truly made my breakfast experience memorable!"
"7.","Alexandra K","332","2025-11-01","5","⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 10/10 Experience at The Hermitage Jakarta We stayed at The Hermitage Jakarta for three nights to celebrate my friend’s birthday, and it was truly one of the most memorable hotel experiences we’ve ever had. From start to finish, every single member of the team went above and beyond to make the stay special. They celebrated my friend’s birthday three times!—first with the whole bar team singing and surprising us with cake and candles in a private room, then again at breakfast with another cake, and finally we returned to our room to find yet another cake and a heartfelt birthday message written on the mirror. They even took a Polaroid of us and turned it into a personalized birthday card—such a thoughtful touch that we’ll never forget. The staff handled every small issue with grace, genuine apologies, and big smiles. Their warmth and professionalism were truly outstanding. The F&B manager personally took time to chat with us, making us feel like friends rather than guests—even while juggling several weddings and private events. The food across the property was amazing, from the rooftop bar (with breathtaking views of Jakarta) to the lounge and breakfast service. Breakfast was both à la carte and buffet-style, with plenty of delicious options. The rooms were spotless thanks to the excellent cleaning team, the beds were extremely comfortable, and the heritage design of the property was absolutely stunning. The rooftop bar is a must-visit—both for the view and the atmosphere. The lounge access was also a great perk, including three glasses of wine, beer, or cocktails per evening, plus a wonderful lounge chef who made every visit feel special. Every staff member we encountered embodied true hospitality—kind, attentive, and genuinely caring. All in all, The Hermitage Jakarta exceeded every expectation. Beautiful heritage property, incredible service, wonderful food, and heartfelt hospitality. Truly a 10/10 stay—we can’t wait to return!"
"8.","Remco Geluk","6","2025-09-01","5","If possible, I would give the service 6 stars, since it is in incredible, from the concierge, to reception, breakfast all the way up till the roof top bar. Colonial style building. Feels rich and going back in the past, with modern amenities. There are reviews that it would be cold in the hotel, but didn’t notice anything on that. All spaces were of comfortable temperature. In the room itself, it was adaptable. Our rooms were spacious with a separate sitting area. Amazing rooftop bar view."
"9.","Christine Ting","12","2025-10-01","5","We stayed for 4 nights in September. Everything was perfect. If you love colonial architecture, this is the hotel for you. We particularly loved the displays of original fixtures and photos of the building before refurbishment throughout the hotel, like a museum. Service was excellent. The rooftop bar overlooks the central Jakarta skyline and is a very nice place to hang out at night. It is also just 5-minute walk from the Antique Market."
"10.","J B","325","2025-12-18","5","Really enjoyed our night at the Hermitage. Staff were incredibly. The big thing though is the cheeseburger. Seriously, the cheeseburgers they serve on the roof are amazing. I actually think these could be the world's best cheeseburgers. I've eaten a lot of cheeseburgers in my life as anyone who's met me could guess by how fat I am. This is the best I've had. I've had cheeseburgers in 100s of restaurants across Canada, the USA, the UK, France, Romania, India, Dubai, Australia, Malaysia, and Indonesia. None were as good as the one at the Hermitage. I don't know what it is about that cheeseburger but, I just can't stop thinking about it. I'll add a picture of three you can enjoy when you're eating the cheeseburger."

Untuk fine dining meeting sangat oke karna pelayan sigap untuk mengganti menu sesuai jam yg seharusnya 🥩 beef cheek maranggi debest🙌🏻🤩 enak banget aseli dagingnya empuk. Hanya saja condimetnya kurang oke buatku. Termasuk sumatra curry emulsion kurang cocok buatku yg suka rempah asli Nuansa ruangan dan hotelnya vintage and old jadi lampunya pun agak remang-remang. Lokasinya strategis, tetapi gedungnya gak besar jadi kurang ngeh posisinya."

"13.","Mike McGovern, Esq.","75","2025-12-11","5","It is a premium Hotel. You pay a premium, but you get premium. My 1st actual bath in 6 months. Gorgeous room. Soft linens. A/C blew so cold I woke up at 02:30...turned it off and took a bath. Just gorgeous all around. Worth it if you can afford it."
"14.","Dayant Ramkalup","50","2025-10-01","5","By far the most beautiful hotel I have ever visited in my life. The room is beautifully decorated in a colonial style with a marble floor and a gigantic bathroom. The room even consists of a living room with a TV and a separate, large bedroom. The beds are wonderful, the room is so clean that the floor shines, the breakfast buffet is delicious, the dishes are great, the Sudanese staff is helpful, friendly, and the location in Menteng is central to all the important sights such as the monument, Sarinah Mall, Proklamasi, and so on. Menteng itself is a chic neighbourhood with beautiful green parks and is not too crowded"

"16.","Bronx2Bali","30","2025-08-01","5","Lovely colonial era heritage hotel I’ve stayed at several times, my favorite Jakarta neighborhood, very friendly staff and classic feel in great location. Breakfast is lovely as is lounge. Hassle free late checkout, which is greatly appreciated. As my flight was pushed out two hours I’d much rather stay at the hotel than the airport - thank you for a lovely stay 🙏🏼 Recommended 💯"

"18.","Matthias Kurrle","4","2025-09-01","5","A wonderful place with a historic colonial atmosphere. Wonderful staff from reception to service. The rooms are beautiful but due to the long tradition of they are a bit old fashioned and some of the renovation have been done not very professionally. The spa is excellent and professional."
"19.","Nabila Putri Salsabila","80","2025-08-01","5","We stayed here for our honeymoon and it was truly unforgettable. The staff went the extra mile to make our experience special, from the warm welcome to the little surprises along the way. We booked a suite, which included a delicious à la carte breakfast and an incredible dinner at the hotel’s club. The hotel feels private and luxurious, with a charming Dutch-Indies design. Our room was beautiful, with a comfy bed, bathtub, and elegant interior. The location in Menteng is peaceful yet central. We also loved the rooftop bar with great Jakarta skyline views at night, plus live DJ music. Everything was top-notch, from the hospitality to the food. It was worth every penny!"
"20.","Jasmine Putri A","2","2025-09-01","2","Beware yang pesen hotel di hermitage ya. Aku pesen yg seharga 2.5 jt (termasuk tax) 50m2 termasuk terrace. Ternyata pas sampe sana dapet yang kecil dan gak ada terrace, acnya gak dingin dan berisik. Kalau cek di trvl artinya di kasih yg kamar harga 1.5 jt. Rasanya kaya di prank dan staffnya ngang ngong bgt asli. Untung krn ac nya berisik dan gak dingin bisa di pindahin kamarnya. Cukup sekali aku staycation di sini. Untung gak jadi wedding jg disini. Sekian :)"
"21.","Handojo Noegroho","66","2025-09-01","5","We went there for a wedding party with a long table seating arrangement and a set menu. The building and interior of the lobby and ballroom are nice, with an old-fashioned style but not boring. The only drawback was the limited parking space, which focused only on valet. So be prepared to park on the street, a bit far from the hotel, or use a taxi or driver. The food presentation and taste are good; recommended."
"22.","Amirullah Lubis","13","2025-11-01","5","The experience has been exceptional, particularly due to the staff's service.

Tapi begitu tahu hotelnya dan merasakan menginap, luarrr biasa 👍👍 Bangunan ada yg heritage, katanya bagian depannya, dan bagian dalam kamarnya terbagi dua area, area kamar dan ruang tamu/kerja/santai... Enak banget, feel at home, gak hanya sekedar kamar..."

"25.","MATTHEW TURNER","3","2025-12-01","4","We came back for the club lounge experience as previously there was a great spread of food and good atmosphere, but this time the food was more like that of a much cheaper hotel. Breakfast was good and staff very attentive."
"26.","y. nuri","33","2025-09-01","5","This hotel has really been the star of our Holiday. The Rooms are always clean and tidy thanks to the Room Attendant, Mr Alif Dharma. He would even hang up our jackets or make cute Towel Animals despite the fact that he wasn’t tipped to do so. The Food at this Hotel is very excellent, everything is fresh and tasty, breakfast is the highlight, especially their traditional Indonesian dishes. The staff here is also excellent, although some english skills lack, they always find a way to communicate with us and help us when we need them. Security and Front desk always welcome us so generously. Last but not least the hotel is very central and its style is both modern with old colonialism. We loved this hotel!!"
"27.","Romario Kusno","70","2025-06-01","5","Staying at The Hermitage Jakarta was a truly memorable experience for me. Tucked away in the charming Menteng area, this heritage hotel beautifully blends colonial elegance with modern luxury 5-star hotel. The rooms are spacious, tastefully decorated, and filled with character of old Batavia-Jakarta. I loved the vintage touches, high ceilings, and luxurious bedding that made every night restful. Rooftop bar at The Hermitage was another highlight. They offers stunning panoramic views of Jakarta's skyline, a very good location for taking photos. It’s the perfect spot for a romantic dinner or a relaxing evening drink. The Hermitage really have a very great hospitality and service. Every staff member I encountered went above and beyond to ensure a comfortable and personalized stay. It felt like being welcomed into a beautifully preserved historical home that refined, peaceful, and full of charm. If you're looking for a unique, boutique hotel experience in Jakarta with a blend of history and luxury. The Hermitage is a perfect choice. I would definitely return and highly recommend it to everyone."
"28.","B S","822","2025-08-01","4","located in Menteng. I was upgraded to a Junior Suite, which included free breakfast, a free evening cocktail, and free late check-out. Although it's a Junior Suite, the room is quite spacious and could actually be considered a suite because, while there's no divider between the living room and the bedroom, it's separated by a bathroom. The layout is unique, as the room is elongated, with the bathroom in the middle. It's like a regular room, but with a living room added in front. The ambiance is classic with classic motifs. A happy babymoon request includes a welcome letter and a chocolate cake. The living room features a sofa, table, chairs, and a work desk. The minibar is complete with Twinnings tea. The spacious bathroom includes a bathtub, two washbasins, a shower, and a closet. Amenities are from the Anargya brand from Mustika Ratu. The room has carpeted flooring. The 180x200 mattress comes with four pillows and two decorative ones. There's a dressing table, a chair, and a lounge chair. The room has a very classic feel. Facilities include a rooftop pool, rooftop bar, gym, and executive lounge. The evening cocktails are delicious, but the variety isn't overwhelming. There's a variety of salads, fruit, pudding, cakes, chicken, beef, pasta, vegetables, and sausage soup. Breakfast is also delicious, but not yet memorable. There's a semi-buffet with unlimited a la carte menu. The a la carte menu can be seen in the photo below. The selection is quite extensive. The buffet includes: 1. Milk, juice, compote, yogurt, cold cuts, bread, salad, dim sum, porridge, vegetables, Hainanese chicken 2. Fruit, cereal, sausage, pasta, tomatoes, mixed vegetables, boiled eggs, beans 3. Rice, fried noodles, mung bean porridge, bread and butter pudding, pastries, and fried foods For the a la carte menu, only try the wagyu fried rice. The wagyu is delicious, but the fried rice is mediocre."

"30.","antung rj","118","2025-09-01","5","Menginap di Hotel The Hermitage sangat berkesan sekali. Walaupun bangunan hotel ex peninggalan era kolonial Belanda, bekas Radio Belanda, tetapi sangat terawat. Tidak terkesan angker. Malah vibes nya pas masuk langsung berasa seperti di Eropa. Petugas hotel hospitality nya two thumbs up, cekatan, ramah dan helpfull. Makanan enak-enak. Seperti makanan restoran lejen yang sangat medok dan otentik rasanya, seperti Soto Betawi, empal, chicken rosemary, dessert, dll Breakfast ada barista stand by dan bisa buatin Piccolo dong 😍. Coffee break ada coffee machine pakai biji kopi Tanamera. So far ratenya Kamar 5/5 Service 5/5 Lokasi 5/5"
"31.","Jeff Franco","38","2025-05-01","5","A Memorable Stay at The Hermitage, a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, Jakarta I recently had the pleasure of staying at The Hermitage during my first visit to Jakarta, and it truly exceeded all expectations. Nestled in a quiet and peaceful corner of the city, the hotel offers a perfect blend of tranquility and central accessibility. It’s conveniently located just a short taxi ride away from major malls and parks, and is surrounded by charming coffee shops that are great for a quick morning fix or a leisurely afternoon. What I appreciated most was the sense of understated luxury and privacy throughout the property. It’s an ideal choice for travelers seeking a serene, refined atmosphere with impeccable service. The rooftop pool and bar were a personal highlight—perfect for a relaxing evening dip or a nightcap, with lovely skyline views that add to the ambience even without being on a high floor. The restaurant also deserves special mention. The food was excellent, and the staff went above and beyond to make my dining experience even more enjoyable. A heartfelt thank you to the team for the extra keropok—it’s a small gesture that made a big impression! Thank you to everyone at The Hermitage for a truly memorable stay. I’m already looking forward to my next visit."

"33.","Sparkly Freeze","91","2025-07-01","5","Hotel Hermitage is centrally located in Jakarta, nestled in the upscale and leafy Menteng neighborhood. Surrounded by lush greenery, it’s an ideal spot for a staycation, meetings, or other events. The service is excellent, and the food is delicious. As a five-star boutique hotel, it offers an artsy and pleasant atmosphere with luxurious, well-appointed facilities. Definitely worth a visit."
"34.","Peter Tan","116","2025-07-01","5","A colonial style retreat closed to the central Jakarta. If you want to avoid modern architecture but still have modern amenities access, this is a not bad place to stay. Spacious room with a living hall walk in room with door for privacy."

"36.","Cindy Wong","186","2025-03-01","5","We stayed at the Hermitage Hotel Jakarta for 3 nights , and it was an amazing experience. The location in the Menteng area is fantastic, with tons of eateries and cafes within walking distance, which made exploring the local food scene really easy. The rooms are spacious, impeccably clean, and equipped with all the amenities you could need. I particularly loved the comfortable beds and stylish decor that made the space feel both luxurious and cozy. The highlight of our stay was definitely the breakfast at Restaurant 1928. The spread was delicious, and the side menu was a great touch, it really set the tone for a relaxing morning. The hotel itself is beautiful, blending modern luxury with a cozy vibe. The staff at the Hermitage are some of the friendliest I’ve encountered .The service was excellent, and the staff made us feel so welcome throughout our stay. Overall, we absolutely loved our time here and would definitely give it a 10/10. It truly added a special touch to our Jakarta trip!"
"37.","Lucien Lim","408","2025-05-01","5","Had a lovely stay here at The Hermitage. Key highlights include the excellent service, beautiful architecture and wholesome breakfast. The hotel offers a medium sized swimming pool and a well-equipped gym. We were given a spacious room that came with a lovely welcome card and local sweets. The staff were always very friendly and eager to assist. The breakfast buffet had a modest selection of local and Western cuisines, but they were all prepared well. We particularly appreciated this as we are of the “quality > quantity” view. The best aspect of the breakfast was the a la carte menu, of which the wagyu fried rice was our favourite. Overall a great stay, highly recommended!"
"38.","Daniel Sin","777","2025-06-01","5","Luxury hotel and the service is exceptional. The location is in a quiet area of central Jakarta. The room was clean and well maintained and the decorations were really beautiful. I've tried their restaurant for dinner and it's kind of strange that they did not offer all the local dishes especially the Nasi Campur which is a traditional dish in Bali. They also have limited beers and those on the menu are not available. Overall I enjoyed my stay at the hotel."
"39.","Leon Winkler (drsleon)","188","2025-01-01","5","I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Hermitage Hotel in Jakarta, and I have to say, it exceeded my expectations in many ways. From the moment you walk in, you’re transported to a bygone era with the hotel’s old-school charm. The marble-lined interiors are elegant, evoking a sense of timeless luxury that makes you feel like you’re stepping into a classic, upscale hotel from another era. The service here is truly outstanding—every staff member I encountered was friendly, professional, and went out of their way to ensure my stay was as comfortable as possible. Whether it was assistance with check-in, restaurant recommendations, or just general inquiries, they handled everything with ease and warmth. The rooms are spacious, immaculately clean, and well-designed, blending modern comforts with classic touches. I found the bed extremely comfortable, making it easy to relax after a long day exploring the city. The attention to detail in the room design adds to the overall experience, and it’s clear that comfort is a priority. Another highlight was the breakfast. The selection was vast, offering both local Indonesian dishes and international options. Everything I tried was fresh and delicious, and it was clear that quality ingredients were used. Overall, the Hermitage is a gem of a hotel, combining luxury, comfort, and impeccable service in the heart of Jakarta. Highly recommended!"
"40.","Arif","10","2025-06-01","5","I have to highlight the incredible service from Bu Metha. She is genuinely enthusiastic about her work and it shows — warm, attentive, and remarkably proactive. I had several requests, including coordinating multiple guests to be placed on the same floor across different days, and she handled it all seamlessly. There was even a water pressure issue in my toilet bowl, and she personally followed up and checked on it herself. Exceptional service like that is rare. However, the some of the staff, while friendly, felt a bit less engaged. Service was relatively slow, not due to any mistakes, but just lacking the energy and initiative that Bu Metha brought. The hotel itself is boutique and charming, not a big commercial chain. The rooms are spacious, which was a pleasant surprise, though the gym and pool are quite small. Overall, if you’re looking for a more intimate and character-rich stay in Jakarta, and especially if Bu Metha is around, this could be a great option."
"41.","alexander nie","4","2025-04-01","3","The room is spacious and looks clean. The rooftop bar indeed offers a great view. Breakfast is simple. However, something unexpected happened. I checked in at 12:00 PM and went out for a business meeting at 2:30 PM. Suddenly, I noticed red swelling on my arm. I’m not sure if it was an allergic reaction or an insect bite, but I’m certain that my arm was completely fine when I checked in. During my time in the room, I sat on the sofa and used the desk for a while. I reported the issue to the hotel manager, but they couldn’t offer any help except calling a nearby hospital to make an appointment. The hotel also had no first-aid kit or any medical facilities available."
"42.","Fazham Fadil","15","2025-01-01","5","This hotel is a unique blend of classic charm and modern comfort. Housed in an older building, the hotel exudes a timeless elegance that adds to its appeal. The spacious rooms are a major highlight, featuring a separate living area, bedroom, and toilet, making it feel more like a small apartment than a standard hotel room. Cleanliness is clearly a priority here, as everything was spotless and well-maintained. The amenities provided were decent, meeting all the basic needs for a comfortable stay. Additionally, the hotel's central location makes it an excellent choice for both business and leisure travelers."
"43.","Bernhard Berwik","17","2025-02-01","3","The hotel and rooms are really beautiful, with all amenities present. The hotels restaurant offers a nice choice of local and western food. But I have to say you will find in surrounding restaurants the same quality for much more affordable prices. During our stay the roof top was under renovation, so we could not fully enjoy the view and cafe on top. But the view from the hotel is nevertheless really worth a visit. The reason why I can only award 3 stars is due to the breakfast experience on our final day of our stay. As on the previous day the hotel was hosting a wedding, many of the guests were staying for the night and thus breakfast on the following day was packed. We went for breakfast at 9am on a Sunday and at that time no tables in the restaurant were available anymore, so we brought to the lounge area. As there's a cigar room next to it, the respective smell is present and it's really not the best combination for a nice start in the day, while trying to enjoy breakfast. Besides that the main issue was that the staff and management didn't seem to be prepared for this many guests. Even though you might expect that they host weddings on a regular basis and the number of guests do not come surprisingly on such events. But the breakfast nevertheless was a real mess, as the staff was not able to stock up the buffet or clean the area in time. So the guests were more or less dealing with leftovers and compared to the prior day it was just disappointing. For breakfast, guests can also choose a la carte, but we had to repeat our order four times to different service staff before it finally arrived after an hour. We made a complaint directly to the manager and I hope they'll make the necessary improvements as this experience was not up to the standards of an otherwise exceptional accommodation."

Upon my check in on 6 June 2025 I was told they needed a deposit of IDR 2 mil which I paid via my debit card. On 10 June 2025 when I checked out I asked about the refundable deposit of IDR 2 mil and the staff that checked me out said the money will be refunded in 3 to 14 days. I followed up on 29 June 2025 for my deposit refund - I call the property directly, I called and WhatsApp the property's mobile number and my calls were ignored as well as my WhatsApp messages. I even saw that the online status on WhatsApp was frequent but the person even ignored my calls and texts. I had to grab their attention via booking.com where you can message the property directly and they responded saying the Finance team doesn't work weekends and they are looking into this matter and promised to give me an update on Monday 30 June 2025. It's now Monday 30 June 2025 and the hotel has still not refunded my money nor has anyone contacted me directly from the hotel to give me an update about the deposit that I am entitled to get a refund."

"46.","Tias Ayu","12","2025-05-01","2","Firstly, I'd like to appreciate for the clean and large room and for the cake. The breakfast is good and the waitress is good but there are not so many variations. However, I am writing to formally express my deep disappointment regarding several incidents that occurred during my recent stay at your hotel: 1. Laundry Service Delay and Miscommunication I submitted my laundry on April 22 at 7:30 AM, expecting it will be finished on the same day as stated. However, by 7:00 PM, I had not received it and contacted the front office multiple times, only to be told to “please wait.” Eventually, I was connected to the laundry department, who informed me that the laundry was not ready. It was only delivered the following morning. On April 23 at 7:00 AM, I again inquired about the laundry and was told it had been delivered by their team. I waited for 30 minutes and still did not receive it. This made me late for work and forced me to wear a t-shirt, as all my shirts were in the laundry. I find this highly unprofessional and frustrating—being told to wait when the service isn’t ready wasted valuable time I could’ve spent preparing for my day. 2. Unacceptable Treatment I left the room earlier while my mother remained. When she later exited the room, she was asked to return the room key—something I’ve never encountered at any Marriott Bonvoy property. Later, when trying to re-enter the room, she was stopped and the staff insisted on calling to confirm whether she could be escorted to the room. This kind of treatment made her feel as though she was being viewed with suspicion. It was uncomfortable and unacceptable. 3. Elevator Malfunction On April 23 at 6:30 PM, the left-side elevator on the first floor was malfunctioning. Despite pressing the “close” button, the doors repeatedly opened and closed. This poses a safety risk and indicates poor maintenance. As a loyal guest who often stays at Marriott Bonvoy properties, this experience was far below the standard I’ve come to expect. I hope the hotel will take this feedback seriously and take appropriate actions to address these issues. I look forward to your response and a resolution to these concerns. Thank you."

Everything is good until the hotel sent their staff to come with card machine and knock the door at 1 am just for charge the room service. Seriously at during midnight while the guest was sleeping!! This is the first time ever that someone come knocking my door for paying the bill during the night. I asked them why dont let me pay when check out tomorrow or at least even in the morning during breakfast but they just apologize and couldn’t do anything. Crazy"

"56.","Olivia W","49","2025-03-01","4","It is an older hotel but the room seems to be well-kept, the AC works fine, and it is equipped with a very comfortable bed. Breakfast: I love that Hermitage offers an a la carte breakfast menu. However on the day that I stayed in, breakfast was a bit of a let down. They ran out of mushrooms for the omellete and baked tomatoes were not baked enough. The parfait tasted great although I personally think it can be served in a smaller cup. Service: Friendly staff but I think they need to be stricter in letting people in? My friend was the first to arrive at the hotel to check in and she had gone to our room when I came. I told the receptionist just that and they simply asked for her name, brought me straight to the room. I have never in my experience had a hotel staff take me to my room without some sort of identification/confirmation with the guest who’s already in the room - which was why I found it strange that Hermitage does this."
"57.","Veronica Fanginia","27","2025-01-01","5","The room is nice, it’s quite rate to find a hotel with living room. It creates little space for guest who pays a visit.

At last, I love how you can order your breakfast from the menu other than just from the buffet and have it served while it’s still hot. A big plus! Best salmon ever 👏"

We talked for some time and he explained the history of the hotel etc. VERY KIND . When it was time to go he gave me his business card and said anything we can do to make your stay more enjoyable just call me also very kind. It was the GM RIZKY . As an Ambassador Bonvoy member i really did appreciate his time. Joseph."
"60.","nevie rost","81","2024-01-01","5","I have been a regular visitor to this restaurant’s rooftop bar since 2014, and it never fails to impress. The serene ambiance and breathtaking view of Jakarta make it a perfect spot to unwind. The cocktails served here are not only visually appealing but also incredibly delicious. The food menu offers a great variety, and I must say that even the street food options, like the banana fritters, are exceptional. It’s a fantastic place to hang out, especially for couples looking for a romantic setting. The hotel itself has a charming colonial vibe, and the service provided by the staff is truly remarkable, from the moment you step through the front door until the end of your stay. The rooms are beautifully decorated and exude a sense of luxury. Overall, this restaurant and hotel combination is a hidden gem that never disappoints."

Yet, after staying for 2 nights, they tried to charge me extra for the 4 pieces of laundry that I had, referencing their policies that meant, “You have to hand them in two by two,” which conflicted with the information that I was given during check-in (accumulative possible).

From the moment I entered, I was warmly welcomed by the hotel staff, who provided exceptional service. They were friendly and incredibly helpful with any requests I had. Special thanks to Mr. Almer, the bellboy, who not only exhibited a friendly demeanor but also demonstrated remarkable efficiency and initiative. The hotel, with its colonial style, is a treasure that transports guests back in time. The elegantly designed rooms are contemporary yet comfortable, making for a delightful stay. The experience was further enhanced by a welcoming cake that was simply delicious. The breakfast offered a selection of traditional dishes that I found to be the best I have ever tasted. Initially hesitant to try Indonesian cuisine, I ordered 'Lontong Sayur,' which was authentically five-star in flavor. I appreciate Chef Adi for his excellent service and detailed explanations of the menu items, showcasing his extensive experience in the culinary field. If we have the opportunity to visit Indonesia again, we will undoubtedly choose to stay at this hotel once more. I extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone involved. You've done an outstanding job.

After reaching the hotel from a late night flight, I was given a warm welcome by the receptionist and was given a mango drink as well. As I was a Platinum Elite member for the Marriott Bonvoy group, they upgraded my room to a suite. Very fast service in settling my check-in to the hotel. The room was very spacious and clean.

The hotel is a Dutch-style building from the Batavia period, and there are many old photos of Jakarta in the corridor. In the evening, there would be a live singing by the swimming pool on the 8th floor. When we were about to leave the hotel, the hotel staff took a photo for us with Polaroids as a souvenir. Here you will feel completely relaxed. Highly recommended."

Terlalu mencolok bahwa mereka mengutamakan pelayanannya ke tamu asing. Agak mengecewakan. Seharusnya semua tamu diperlakukan sama. Saat tamu asing memasuki ruang makan, maka pelayan dengan sigap langsung menanyakan tamu tsb ingin duduk di sebelah mana, secara berkala didatangi mejanya ditanyakan. Diinfokan juga minuman apa saja yang tersedia & diantar ke meja untuk minuman yang mereka pilih. Sedangkan tamu lokal dipersilahkan masuk ruangan sendiri, cari meja sendiri, ambil makanan & minuman sendiri. Mandiri sekali."

There are some other weird things about the property - the lobby courtyard could be magnificent, but instead is totally wasted. There coukd be an outdoor table or two in front, but no. As a result there is nowhere pleasant to sit - other than in the room or on the very small rooftop - which is a waste of a great building. With so much potential, this could be made into the best hotel in town. The owners should take note, change out the f&b management, and bring the quality of the restaurant up to a higher standard as a first step."

"95.","Jasmine Chau","27","2025-01-01","1","Extremely Disappointing Experience at The Hermitage Hotel in Jakarta As a frequent traveler and a loyal customer of five-star hotels, I had high expectations for my experience at The Hermitage Hotel. Unfortunately, my stay was marred by a series of issues that left me utterly dissatisfied. First and foremost, I would like to address the misleading information provided during the booking process. Our reservation clearly stated that the room would include a spacious, luxurious 3meter bed. However, upon arrival, we were shocked to find ourselves assigned to a room with a significantly smaller bed. This unexpected change not only impacted our comfort but also made us question the accuracy of your online descriptions. Furthermore, the breakfast provided at your hotel was far from satisfactory. I specifically ordered hot milk, yet I was served warm soy milk instead. This lack of attention to detail and disregard for guest preferences is simply unacceptable for a five-star establishment. Additionally, despite numerous requests for small towels, they were never delivered to our room, leaving us inconvenienced and frustrated. The most disheartening aspect of our stay, however, was the dismissive and unprofessional manner in which our complaints were handled by your reception team. We lodged our grievances at 7:30 PM before leaving for dinner, only to return at 11:30 PM and find that no acceptable compensation or resolution had been provided. The lack of effective communication between the night shift and morning shift is concerning and reflects poorly on your management. During our checkout at 9 AM the next morning, I was approached by a staff member named Nancy, who appeared completely unaware of our previous complaints. She inquired if our complaint was about the air conditioning, demonstrating a clear lack of coordination and seriousness when it comes to addressing client concerns. This level of disregard for customer feedback is simply unacceptable. Given the immense potential of The Hermitage Hotel, it is disheartening to witness such a significant gap between its current state and the high standards expected of a five-star establishment. I urge the owners and management to take immediate action to rectify these issues. It is imperative that you reassess the competence of your reception team and introduce necessary changes to bring your hotel up to the level of excellence it aspires to. As a dissatisfied guest, I feel compelled to share my negative experience with those in my circle to ensure they steer clear of such an unacceptable establishment. I sincerely hope that my feedback is taken seriously and that necessary steps are promptly taken to address the concerns raised. By doing so, The Hermitage Hotel has the potential to become the best hotel in town, providing exceptional service and exceeding the expectations of its discerning guests."

All the staff is pleasant, very friendly and helpful. The room is clean and beautiful. 2 stars because the buffet have pork. Breakfast buffet and in-room menus have pork. We tried to confirm with their kitchen either it is from separate restaurant, but the kitchen informed us it is from same restaurant 1928. However the kitchen mentioned to us that their meat is from halal sources. Im not sure either this is normal in Indonesia because I’m from Malaysia and we have strict guidelines on halal food. Cooking and preparation for halal and non halal ingredients need to be separated. In Malaysia they cannot claim halal if they serve pork in same restaurant. One of the reason we booked this hotel because we saw this hotel in Indonesia halalbooking website and the website mentioned all food is halal. So we’re very disappointed when we saw pork in their menus. This also cause trouble for us to find alternatives for breakfast since we’re not confident to eat their buffet. Other than that, we’re satisfied with the hotel."

The Executive Suite boasted a wealth of lavish comforts, while the exclusive offerings from LE LABO x EDITION added an extra layer of opulence to my stay. Culinary Excellence: The dining experiences at The Hermitage were nothing short of exceptional. From tantalizing local delicacies to international fare, each dish was a symphony of flavors that delighted the palate and left a lasting impression. Rooftop Serenity: The rooftop oasis of The Hermitage provided a breathtaking escape from the urban landscape below. With its panoramic views of Jakarta's skyline and the serene ambiance of the rooftop pool, it offered a tranquil retreat where I could unwind and rejuvenate amidst the city's hustle and bustle. Conclusion: My time at The Hermitage, A Tribute Portfolio Hotel Jakarta, was a journey into tranquility and opulence. From the timeless elegance of the Executive Suite to the culinary delights and rooftop serenity, every moment was a testament to the hotel's commitment to providing an unforgettable experience. I look forward to returning to bask once more in its luxurious embrace."

Desain bangunannya klasik tetapi mewah rasanya, penuh dengan ornamen lawas. Kamarnya sangat oke meskipun viewnya kurang menarik, dikarenakan bangunannya yang tidak terlalu tinggi. Untuk restonya menunya kurang variatif menurutku, cuma kita bisa pesan menu sendiri yang sudah include alias gak perlu bayar lagi. Dessertnya favorit banget sih, banyak pilihannya."
"101.","Bevin Clare","322","2024-01-01","5","This hotel far exceeded our expectations. In fact, the biggest surprise about this hotel was that it was a tribute portfolio and not a Luxury Collection. It hits extremely high marks on the quality of rooms, service, excellent housekeeping including turn down service, delightful and relaxing Club Lounge with a select bar and a high quality of offerings. Everything was nearly perfect and the only suggestion we could make is that the bathrooms were incredibly tiny and only fit my 9-year-old child. Highly recommended for a stay in Jakarta."

I was unwell unfortunately during our stay but Metha, Mr. Julius and their team went above and beyond to help me get better. Metha helped me find doctors and get prescriptions, Mr. Julius personally took it on him to ensure my meals were made accordingly and made me herbal teas himself. He showed us around the vicinity as well. Vini introduced me to local treats and herbs, which were so lovely!! Thank you all so much. We would definitely be staying at the Hermitage the next time we visit as well 💕🙏🏻"

Kamar mandi selalu bersih dan berfungsi, ruangan meeting nyaman, bouquet prasmanan juga disajikan dengan menarik. Makanan beratnya cukup enak, hanya untuk dessert bisa ditingkatkan lagi rasanya. Selebihnya sudah oke. Will definitely come back."

Shouldn’t they have standby generator that automatically back-up the electricity?

If you’re after hotel’s breakfast, I can vouch for their exceptional breakfast for both buffet (change daily) and a la carte."

Booked the terrace rooms and they were quite comfy and spacious. + E-butler service is also responsive as well, which is a plus point. + The food in the lounge was fantastic. I can't forget the rendang. The meat was so soft, succulent and tasty. + Breakfast food was not too bad, but feels like service could be improved. Minus: - The directions though could use a little help. The spa is at level 2, club lounge is at level 8, and swimming pool is at level 9. They could have written them in the lift but it was nowhere to be found. - The TV in the room are not yet smart TV. That could turn into a plus point for those having staycation. - Parking space is rather limited."

The staff has a big problem in cleaning progress which made me very disappointed and disgusted .. the terrace, had a very simple cleaning ... the room many people stay in it .. so cleaning is the first priority to the next visitor. the hotel is nice and unique.. but these things destroy to the total image.. the other thing , I woke up late , and I wanted to have an American breakfast . It's very simple to do .. which the chef insisted that the time was over and he can't cook sunny side up, which I am not asking it for free. I am paying for it. As long as the basic ingredients are available, then a great chef has no issue to pleasure the hotel guests. I guess the staff need to learn how to be creative and solve issues not memorizing SOPs specifically when it comes to guest service ( specifically Marriott group of hotels )."

One of the best presereved building / hotel in Central Jakarta, Not just the building itself but it comes down to other details such as the windows and the interior design they still used the old dutch colonial style that used during the early 19th century during the Dutch East Indies era. The view from the rooftop bar is magnificent, all the staffs are amiable and the breakfast here also scrumptious."

Lokasi strategis banget di tengah2 menteng kan... Tau lah. Dr satpam depan sampai OB, restoran semua ramah. Kamarnya luas banget.. Nyaman.. Hny pas kami dapat kamar, gak bisa semua lampu dimatikan, jd gak bisa gelap bgt. Banyak spot lucu yg instagramable. Bisa pesan baby crib utk bayinya.. Dan oldies/vintage juga lho baby cribnya 😅 Sayangnya kolamnya hny 1 jenis kedalaman (1,2 m) jd utk anak yg blm berenang hny sampai tangga aja.. Gak sempat ke roof top. Ruang bilas bersih.

"128.","Dr. Nugroho","405","2023-01-01","3","Went to a wedding party in the hotel's restaurant . Just give 3 stars. The reason is as follow: what do people expect in a party? Good food?. No. We can find better foods out there. To see the grandeur of the interior? No. What for? To listen to the music band?. No. We come together to talk. That's the most important thing in a party. Talking to families and friends. But what happened? I found it even difficult to talk to a person sitting next to me. The music was so loud. I complained to one of the people there. They paid no attention... Many wedding organizers failed to understand this essential fundamental rule. Not just this time. Again, people come not to see a concert, but to talk... As for the food, it's just another hotel food. Just standard. Anyway, this review is mostly for the organizer, not the hotel itself."

"133.","Cahyo","194","2020-01-01","4","Large and magnificent building, still maintaining Dutch style. Environment is maintained, comfortable and clean. The toilet is clean and smell good. Hotel room feels cramped because there is a dividing door between the living room and bedroom, there is no view that leads out, like trapped. Toiletries are incomplete and less attractive. Narrow lobby, smell cigarettes. The price is expensive, but it is not comparable to the food menu that is too economical, the variation is less, and the taste is not good. Friendly officers or staffs. Strategic location, convenient because it is far from noise."
"134.","Nathan Brantley","9","2024-01-01","5","I’d rather safeguard this info to keep this gem of a hotel to myself… but I’ll let you in on one of the most boutique experiences you’ll have at a Marriott. The Hermitage is a elegant, British colonial inspired hotel with all the finery of a eastern Asian and Indonesian culture. The food and dining are some of the best you’ll find in Jakarta (which as a foodie who rarely eats to eat at my hotel, I was impressed). The staff consistently go above and beyond to make your experience special and personal. Charlotte in the executive lounge was revered amongst all of my friends who have stayed at the Hermitage and her teams attention to detail is unmatched. The hotel itself is smaller in size but every space is artistically curated. The bar on the first floor with the brilliant mixologist is not to be missed. NOTE: They host events sometimes including walking tours and special events in the bar so inquire with concierge. Charlotte as well, showed me to my car as I departed the hotel - and more broadly Jakarta and Indonesia. The warmth they showed me and my friends are representative of the very best Marriott has to offer."
"135.","Sarah Humaira","3","2025-01-01","2","My experience at this hotel, especially during such a significant time as my wedding and honeymoon, was far from satisfactory. Despite placing my laundry in their provided bag, upon inquiry, I was given someone else's clothes. Furthermore, the confusion surrounding room changes added unnecessary stress. Initially directed to the third floor, my husband was later assigned a room on the fifth floor, causing further inconvenience. Prior to checkout, I discovered that not only was my laundry unaccounted for, but my personal belongings, including my heels left in the honeymoon room's drawer, were neglected during the turnover process. The lack of communication regarding our belongings was disheartening. Only after persistent follow-up did they confirm the retrieval of my heels, albeit with delays and additional requests for proof. As a bride embarking on her honeymoon, I expected a seamless and attentive experience, yet encountered disappointments at every turn. Such oversights and delays marred what should have been a joyous occasion. Improvement in communication, attention to detail, and accountability is essential to meet the expectations of guests, particularly during such momentous occasions."

Kamar nya dilengkapi dengan ruang keluarga yang kompak. Area restaurant terbatas namun pelayanan dan menu makan nya beragam.

Only issue which leads me to give bad recommendation is that we were locked out of our rooms on last day when we went for breakfast. That should never happen in a 5 star property . When I went to front desk was asked what time we going to check out before activating card. It reflect poorly, when checkout time is 12, it’s not even 9 am and card are disabled. And we were looking to leave before 11, so why disable the cards? Whatever the cause, hope hotel can address those cause otherwise the stay was excellent and staff was super friendly and helpful. I feel bad giving bad rating but it’s more for the changes required in otherwise excellent hotel."

My only complaint is that the thermostat for the AC in my room was not working properly, so it was either 18 or 30 degrees - not much in between.

Hotel tidak mengantisipasi banyak tamu saat sarapan, makanan yg hampir habis dan peralatan makan yg kosong tidak segera diisi kembali. Saat kami sarapan di resto tidak tersedia tempat duduk, sendok dan garpu. Salah satu staf meminta kami utk duduk di lounge dan akan mengantar sendok dan garpu, namun sampai sarapan kami habis sendok dan garpu tak kunjung datang."

"188.","Yulius Indrajaya","49","2023-01-01","5","One of the upper class of Marriot's Network in Jakarta. The Hotel bring the vintage POV that maybe comes from its name, Hermitage (from Heritage maybe?) The Hotel used the old building of the first Post office building in Jakarta. The building is old, but very well taken care of. I got free upgraded to Executive room the last time I was there. The room was quite large and have a separation between bedroom and guest room. The hospitality is excellent. The Breakfast is unique. They don't offer much in the buffet, but you can order from the menu. The variation isn't differ much but the quality of the food was top notch. Even a simple omelette felt special here. My Score Bedroom: 8,7 Service & Hospitality: 9,5 Breakfast : 9.0 Value for price: 8,9 A very pleasant experience indeed. Added on June 22 Now the club benefit offer more variety of main course and free flow of limited cocktail. Ps: I love how they add value to something that nearly perfect"
"189.","Kevin Khorigin","86","2023-01-01","5","Stayed here in August 2022 with my extended family to celebrate my sister's birthday. We had booked three rooms for one night. Summary: Outstanding stay that exceeded all expectation! Run and quickly book this hotel! Pre-arrival I had called the hotel before booking the stay, inquiring about Suite Night Award, where I was helped by Metha. I was given the duty manager WhatsApp contact, and we continued our conversation there. Metha took our requests, and from our interaction, I knew that this stay will be a wonderful one. I contacted them again a day before our stay for a request, and they went above and beyond in fulfilling that request. Check In Clara welcomed us during check in, where the check-in was processed efficiently. Someone took our luggage and brought it to our room. They gave my 5-year old son a special slipper, which he loved. The welcome gift was also very unique :) Room Our Suite Night Award cleared and the Executive Suite assigned to us was really nice. The room was clean, had a lot of natural lighting, and even came with two (2!) balconies. Bed was comfortable. There were a lot of seating areas. AC can be set to be very cold if needed. Service Outstanding! Didn't I mention that they went above and beyond on our requests? Dinner The room came with evening club benefit, where each person was given a main course option. Since most of us were vegetarian, the chef prepared an Indian platter option for us. Food quality was even higher than the one at Ritz Carlton Club. Their Tempe Nachos was really good! Thank you Chef Arya and the team! Breakfast Selection is not as big, but we're also given ala-carte option to order from. Fresh juice was also available. Facility Swimming pool on the top floor is of good size, although the water is a bit on the colder side (but that might be because it rained during our stay). Conclusion Looking forward to the next opportunity to stay here again. Top hospitality from everyone!"

Seperti hal yang sepele, saat saya berniat meminjam piring dan alat makan. Namun dianterinnya lama banget 1 jam baru sampai. Padahal hotel tidak terlalu penuh dan waktu peminjaman jam 11 malam.

"202.","Armansyah","813","2025-02-01","5","The Hermitage Mariott, Menteng Jakarta Pusat Update, kembali lagi ke sini awal tahun 2025. Terkagum dengan hotel bintang 5 penuh sejarah. Dari bacaan yang pernah saya baca, The Hermitage menempati gedung bersejarah yang berdiri pada 1923. Suasana klasik terasa karen Hotel sama sekali tidak mengubah arsitekturnya. Gedung bersejarah hotel ini menggunakan arsitektur art deco dari Jasin Tedjasukmana dan desain interior dari Thomas Elliott. Dulunya pada 1923, gedung ini merupakan kantor telekomunikasi kolonial Belanda, setelah Indonesia merdeka, pada 1945-1946 beralih fungsi menjadi gedung Komite Nasional Indonesia. Pada 1960 gedung ini menjadi kantor Kementerian Pengajaran dan Pendidikan Indonesia, dan terakhir pada 1999 beralih fungsi lagi menjadi Universitas Bung Karno. (Dikutip dari situs Kumparan Travel) Terimakasih telah membawa kami ke masa-masa penuh sejarah."

Sehingga memberikan kesan aman, nyaman dan tidak menakutkan. Sajian makanannya yang enak dan lezat khas hotel berbintang. Padanan warna interior yang didominasi warna putih memberikan kesan lapang dan luas, meski banyak sekatan. Kamar kecilnya bersih, dengan toiletris yang modern. Namun sayang tempat parkirnya kecil, sehingga setelah beberapa kali berputar tak dapat dapat, akhirnya parkir diluar."
"206.","Freddy Samad","383","2021-01-01","5","The hidden gem of Jakarta! A small boutique hotel run by Marriott group, it was built on a very well renovated colonial building. Located in the heart of Menteng, it cannot be more strategic. The interior was simple yet elegant, depicting the glory days of old time. Small but very comfy and cozy, it reminded me of Ritz Carlton San Francisco. The room was spacious and super quiet, and all the linen was well made. The bed was super comfy and the furnitures were of high quality new antique. The shower offered both standard and rain mode. The sink, like the furnitures, was of high quality marble top. The breakfast place wasn't big but the buffet had a lot of options and delicious. I also like the way they sneaked in a noodle hawker stand in it. The swimming pool wasn't big either, and nothing special about it, but enough to get some fun under the sun. Must repeat"
"207.","Steve Bintley","1538","2021-01-01","5","My short weekend was enough to make it truly memorable and I can’t recommend the hotel highly enough. Before my stay I had some superb email dialogue with the hotel where they also arranged transport from the airport. This was a seamless experience and the driver gave a good insight to the city along the way. There’s a full security check when you arrive at the hotel but that’s certainly reassuring. The staff at the door were friendly and welcoming but it was a shame that no guidance was offered to the reception area, since it isn’t obvious when you immediately walk in. Despite arriving quite late into the evening there were plenty of staff working and the welcome great. Checking in was a pleasant experience sat at the desks and didn’t take long, with a member of staff taking care of luggage and showing me to the first floor Executive room. All the communal areas and corridors were wonderful, with interesting pictures on the walls and a real homely and traditional feel, as well as being spotlessly clean; first impressions of the room were equally as impressive. The door to the room was nothing like a normal hotel room door, really embracing the promised colonial style and revealed a spacious sitting area complete with sofa, coffee table, desk and large TV. This was a really pleasant area and would ensure a long stay would remain comfortable. Further into the room was a well-stocked min bar along with coffee machine and sizeable wardrobe, with plenty of hangers and digital safe, slippers and gowns, plus ironing facilities. Annoyingly there was no bottle opener for drinks in the fridge. The main bedroom area was really cosy. It wasn’t overly large but that wasn’t a problem with the extra living area however there was an armchair, another TV, bedside table at both sides of the bed complete with electric sockets and really nice lighting. These lights were controlled from one side of the bed and had reading options, night lights, full brightness etc, all which continued to make the room really comfortable. The bed was large and superb plus there was absolutely no noise either from the corridors, adjacent rooms or outside. Air-con worked really well without being noisy. The bathroom was separated from the main bedroom with floor to ceiling glass, with manual blinds for privacy if needed. Double sinks, large mirror and all the accessories you could desire were present. There was no bath but the walk in shower was large with a rainforest head and nice plentiful towels. A ceiling speaker continued the TV audio in the room but it wasn’t loud enough to be useable. Housekeeping was superb - I never heard or saw anyone in the corridors but they were clearly paying close attention to the ‘do not disturb’ sign and, even when displayed until late in the afternoon, they returned proactively and did a thorough job. Bottled water was always restocked and the coffee and mini bar remained replenished. The best gem in the hotel is the swimming pool and bar on the top floor. The infinity style pool isn’t massive but a decent enough size for the hotel and there’s some nice seating surrounding. The open roof also gives a good vibe and atmosphere. Climb the stairs onto the roof though and the bar’s seating is wonderful - brilliant views over the city from the raised stools and more comfortable sofa style seating available at the other end. Lively music is piped throughout and the staff are both attentive and super friendly. This is the perfect spot to enjoy sunset and the city’s night lights with the uninterrupted 360-degree view. Food is available and always presented well. The Nasi Goreng dishes were particularly enjoyable and I’d highly recommend - trusting the ‘chef’s special’ icons isn’t a mistake here! Overall I really enjoyed my stay here; the room was wonderful, the staff are super friendly and happy to engage in nice conversation and the location worked well. The whole property was spotlessly clean and traditional in feel and I can’t wait to return."

"210.","Ryzky Yudha (Ryu)","49","2023-01-01","3","Nice colonial theme room with bathub overlooking the street, that is it. The reception check-in team is terrible, they didn’t even bother to explain how to get to the room, despite it is very confusing layout with so many narrow halls and similar doors with often no clear direction/guide. So me and friends has to carry bags going around and around the lobby. Complained to the customer service, the manager said sorry but the reception does not even say a word when I check out. And expect it to even be more confusing with random crowds from wedding and bazaar that they have in a tiny hall. For two nights I was there, at least 4 different events. And expect the noise from the loading and offloading trucks late at night"
"211.","budi Marto","80","2019-01-01","4","This is a very quaint little hotel, once you step in you get carried back to the early dutch colony days where the rich is rich and the poor is poor. The service was impeccable in the bar, and the people was very nice. They have a very nice smoking are that made you feel happy. I look forward to coming back here, the only problem is that it is seriously in the middle of the most congested part of Jakarta. But if you are trying to find a safe haven in the middle of the hustle and bustle, this is a great small place to stay."

Padahal cuma kamera doang, ga pake tripod, lampu dan bukan komersil😪. Kalo yg hobi motret sambil jalan-jalan, pasti tau, yg ga boleh itu motret dengan alat tambahan, seperti lampu, reflektor, karena pasti mengganggu, dan juga tripod karena dapat merusak lantai. Gw jalan-jalan dari US, Rusia, eropa, Asia tengah, sekalinya disemprit sama sekuriti cuma di London karena pake tripod, dan di hotel ini sama waitresnya.😄 Untuk lain2nya biasa, kolam renang ga ada buat anak, dan kecil, kafe rooftop juga sempit, kamar bagus, tapi kamar mandi ga ada jet spray. Makanan enak, tapi kurang variatif. Maaf, saya terpaksa kasih bintang 1 dulu yaaa (jarang banget kasih bintang 1), gara2 aturan kolonial, pengalaman menginap jadi kurang mengenakkan."

Dari sisi kamar sangat nyaman dengan kebersihan yang terjaga namun akses dari lobby menuju lift cukup membingungkan, karena gedung ini seperti labirin sehingga sampai diarahkan staff hotel untuk ke lift. Dari lift ke lobby ada penunjuk arah namun dari lobby ke lift tidak ada. 1 lagi sedikit masukan, pencahayaan di ruangan rapat sangat minim, sehingga ketika saat kegiatan fullboard yang mengharuskan rapat sampai malam, cukup melelahkan mata."

"232.","Allen Wen","176","2022-01-01","5","One of my favourite hotels in Jakarta. Service is always outstanding. The colonial styled building is beautiful and charming. Enjoy the rooftop cocktail experience in the evening and view the city's skyline."
"233.","Novitasari Putri","80","2023-01-01","5","Datang utk acara pernikahan, sederhana tp mewah. Makanan enak, service oke, kamar belum pernah liat jd belum bs ksh rating. Kekurangan cuma 1 yaitu di area parkiran yg kecil, sempet bingung cari parkir klo lg ada acara yg berbarengan."
"234.","Andy Chang","14","2017-01-01","2","Definitely overpriced, but the hotel is gorgeous. My friend and I both found the waiter patronizing and slow, though. When asked to recommend drinks, he didn't even care to explain but merely repeat the names of the drinks as if silver moon speaks for itself. Meanwhile, a group of Indonesian high school students were so loudly shouting and screaming but he didn't even ask them to be quieter. Definitely wouldn't recommend the customer service of staff, especially considering this is supposed to be a five-star hotel."

"236.","Ajeng Wahyuni","243","2023-01-01","5","A perfect place for a staycation for Jakartans. This place is really nice, clean and have a beautifully arranged furnitures. It has a rooftop lounge/bar, it's really nice during sunset. The food is good, service is superb because I feel like home, and the place is beautiful. Will have this place in my list for a staycation in the city."
"237.","Henra Saragih","192","2019-01-01","5","If you like staying in a vintage or colonial style design hotel, this hotel is your top choice.This hotel has less than 100 rooms only so it’s more like private hotel but it’s 5 stars hotel. The swimming pool is one thing you should try and enjoy. The famous antique market in Jakarta “Surabaya street” is just a few walks from this hotel. There are some very nice restaurants near the hotel as well and it’s walking distance too."

"240.","Madelina Ariani","68","2018-01-01","5","Awalnya sih agak kaget dengan gaya hotel ini dari luat. Agak jadul kaya zaman2 penjajahan gitu nuansanya (tapi karena datang malam n bangunannya terlihat klasik gitu kali ya). Pemeriksaan lengkap sebelum masuk. Ternyata benar, nuansa di dalam hotel pun juga klasik. Kemarin nginap di lantai 1 kamarnya, nuansanya putih dan bersih. Nah... Pas nyampai kamar.. Wow... Nyaman banget, ada ruangan buat kita ngobrol bersekat dari ruanh tidur. Kaya ruang tamu kecil gitu. Ada dua tv jadi aman kita gak perlu rebutan channel, satu bisa nonton sambil tiduran, satu lagi nonton sambil sanfai di sofa. Ada meja belajar atau kerjanya. Internet aman lancar. Makanan enak. Dan ruang meeting nyaman."
"241.","Arfias Lutfi Madyansyah","99","2020-01-01","5","Great hotel with perfect location. The staff is friendly. The food is delicious. But, if you go there by a bike you need to park it at the other street and it becomes more difficult when it is rained because there is no direct access from the bike parking lot to the hotel."
"242.","Agnes Pinnar","217","2021-01-01","4","Hotelnya bagus. Kami datang untuk bfast di L'avenue Resto. Makanannya enak. Layak dapat bintang 5. Tapi begitu masuk lobby bau rokok. Ternyata karena ada smoking area. Walaupun di ruang tertutup, baunya tetep keluar."
"243.","Suci Landon","70","2022-01-01","5","It is always a great experience to be back and spend time at The Hermitage! Of course, this is not the first time we stayed here, but it is always the same nice feeling and superb service we experienced, if not better! From the time of our arrival, we were already greeted with amazing hospitality. The hotel staffs applied very clear Covid-19’s SOP, making us feel safe and protected while being in the public place. I have to say special thanks to Mr. Papang, the Guest Service Manager, who has been so kind and stand by all the time in making sure that we have the most amazing stress free stay, we even got upgraded to Junior Suite, and we enjoyed every single bit of it! Let me go through several details: - Room: we simply love our room so much! It is super tidy, clean and comfortable. Our son loves to have bath at the bathtub. The staffs also cleaned the room following a very strict health protocol. - Swimming Pool: The pool just had a renovation, the water is clean and warm, and we love to spend time there. The pool also never pack with people, and we are happy with it. We love sitting by the La Vue bar while monitoring our son swimming happily. - One of the main attaction of Hermitage is their rooftop, I notice that there were many people whom would like to enjoy the view of Central Jakarta, especially during the sunset time, while sipping some drinks or nibbling some snacks. We could enjoy being outdoor and having a nice breeze. - The best thing of Hermitage that I notice has always been their Great Service! At this hotel, the service is always top notch, the whole staff from the time we set our foot up to wherever we go (reception, restaurant, in house dining, cleaning dept) gave us nothing but smile and always try to cater your need. I hope the hotel can maintain this significant characteristic all the time. - Location of the hotel is smack bang in the middle of everything, and very close to main attractions of Jakarta, such as: Monas, parks and super fancy malls like Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia, such a convenient place to choose. Under this management, I admit that staying in the Hermitage during Covid-19 time is still super enjoyable and memorable, so I would like to adress special thanks to Mr. Severin Huerlimann and the whole staffs for making sure that guests can still have relax and quality time when staying at this beautiful Boutique Hotel! We can’t wait to comeback and have another staycation soon ❤️"

"248.","Lia","215","2019-01-01","4","Went here for an event at the restaurant. The decoration of the hotel remind me of Dutch style. The lamp, curtain, chair, and everything. The food that I tried such as Nasi Goreng, Fried Chicken, Black Pepper Meat, and Oxtail Soup. I like one of the dessert they served, it is like Cream of Mango, but I can taste some biscuits in it. The restroom is clean. They have two toilets and two mirrors. Good place."

"252.","Airindira Graciella Siregar Prabowo","9","2022-01-01","5","One of hidden gem property for staycation in the middle of J town. I found this place coincidentally, on going plan to spend our weekend in Jakarta. Since my husband and I just spent few staycations at the luxury and heritage hotels in Java and love to repeat the moment in other place, so we're looked for it and never guess if Jakarta has the one that we really want. Our first impression to The Hermitage was 'This is the one!'. We are glad to be here in a cultivate elegance place meets colonial charms in which we were so relax with the quietness while enjoying the heritage. We stayed at the executive room with living room and one king bed since I had to watched the LIVE virtual concert of my favorite band, BTS (if you know it, lol) and enjoyed watching in the living room without too much noise. I had requested several things such are the room close to the elevator, good view, clean and smells great include late check out as a member of Marriot Convoy and all are accommodated thru your kind services. My husband and I were really satisfied with it and specially your fast response when we need new battery for remote, when we ordered- almost-late a Nasi Goreng Babi Sambal Matah and capsules for the coffee machine. In terms of breakfast menu, as we loved the ambience of L' Avenue restaurant, the limited menu was not too issue for us. But, a little notes about it, perhaps in the future kindly your F&B staff could informed at the first about the menu that were ready to serve such bread, rice, cornflakes and etc and menu that we needed to ask and order such are omelette, bacon, sausage and etc, which those were not ready to serve on the table. Sometimes the visitor would not ask and just see what the items are served on the table, meanwhile you will get the omelette and others too for free. So, communication and information during the welcoming your guest are really important, please take note of it. Overall, we were happy to stay here and will come back and try to have coffee time at roof top next time or swimming at your pool. Keep your excellence service up and thanks for your kind hospitality. Love, @aethetraveler (ig)."

The interior style and architecture would bring you back to dutch colonial era. It really is a shame that the amenity isnt branded and they dont have a wide of food selection either in room dining or breakfast. And they dont really have spa service, which also is a shame. The staff are very helpful but theyre not as friendly as i expected. Nevertheless, its an amazing experience."

Tp utk hotelnya pas malem agak sepi jd agak mistis gitu mungkin karena arsitekturnya belanda, karna dlunya memang bangunan bekas kolonial"

We came back again a year later to celebrate our anniversary."

"262.","Raymond Lind","1721","2020-01-01","4","The Hermitage, a Tribute Portfolio hotel, is housed in a beautifully restored building from the Dutch colonial period, and this was the main selling point for us. No expense has been spared to restore the former telegraph building. Our room was in the new wing located behind the original building but it still had lovely period touches, and was very comfortable. The bar on the roof of the building has great views but is super expensive and service is weak. Service in the hotel itself is good though."

The concept of the building was classic elegant, with the help of the building's history that made you feel like being in the good ol' european building. Good location, in the heart of central jakarta. but the hotel didnt located exactly on the crowded road so it was so relaxing. The room arrangement was excellent. The city landscape from the rooftop bar was undeniably beautiful in the night. Swimming pool and gym were located on the highest level of the hotel made it so private and not to mention, good equipments. For the breakfast, they seemed to prefer the european cuisines, but with a little local choices like porridge and snacks. But for a 5 star hotel i hope the hermitage will completing the facilities like public hot tub or jacuzzi and sauna."

Tapi menurut saya fasilitasnya ga sesuai dengan tarifnya. Ukuran kamar yang paling ekonomis dengan harga yang ditawarkan ga sesuai, terlalu kecil, tempat tidurnya juga kecil, bangunannya juga kelihatan seperti bangunan tua, kalo buat saya sih kalo malam agak horor gitu. Apalagi pas duduk di lobby lagi nunggu kendaraan datang, tiba2 dari atas netes air ga tau air apa, saat petugasnya dikasih tau reaksinya diam saja, hadeeuuuhhh, pokoknya ga sesuai sama tarifnyalah ....."

Lalu pas masuk ditanya kamar berapa kita bilang 2 kamar dan 4 orang dipersilahkan masuk tapi saya tidak suka dengan cara melihat pelayan bernama jessica yg melihat orng tua saya dan mertua saya dari atas rambut ke bawah mungkin memang oran tua kami dari kampung tapi bukan dengan cara bgitu juga melihat orang dari penampilan... Pas sudha masuk ke dalam di cegat lagi ambil makanan di depan orang rame malu dong. . Dibilang bahwa hanya dapat makan 2 orang saja.. Saya bilang oke saya diskusi dulu keluar karena sy baru tau ada aturan d hotel nginap berdua 1 kamar yg makan cuma 1 kan lucu... Baru sekali ini pengalaman hotel bagus tapi jatah makan 1 per kmar king lagi... Dan yang lucu nya adalah udh masuk pula baru di larang ambil makanan kan ga ada etika -nya..Harusnya ber etika dan bersopan santun, panggil saya keluar dulu bukan ditegur depan orng banyak dan terdengar oleh orang tua saya lagi...kasihan mereka sudah tua dihitukan oleh pelayan hotel...malu kan mereka apalagi saya...apalagi kantor dan perusahaan saya sering rekanan meeting disini tidak pernah begini...

Disini menyajikan lumpia terenak yang pernah saya makan, dan jakarta terlihat sedikit lebih indah kalo dilihat dari roof top. Will coming back :)"

"304.","rafael","258","2023-01-01","5","Good restaurant L'avenue. Beautiful Hermitage decoration, food and price was ok. The service kind and the place is very quiet, not many people on Sunday, good place for a relax lunch or brunch. I will come back."

Major reason is the staff that goes above and beyond, from reception to bar.., absolute world class, gorgeous interior, jackfruit for breakfast, homemade Sambal for dinner and the best Negroni to go with it! Terima Kasih!"
"308.","andy aryawan","491","2020-01-01","4","One of the best interior hotel for the classic category. Great food and cozy atmosphere. I would give a 5 star if they have more staff available during the several meeting at the same time"

"312.","Evelyn Ma","14","2025-01-01","5","The best of this hotel is the staff. Every staff was very kind, friendly and always smiled. If I visit again the city of Jakarta, it must be for staying this hotel again."
"313.","Arne Trautmann","741","2018-01-01","5","This is about the La Vue Rooftop Bar & Pool Resto: A must. You want to spend the night there sitting at the old colonial pool or looking at Jakarta's mighty skyline from the rooftop of an old dutch colonial building. The drinks are good, and so is the food (we had Asian favourites). Service is friendly and helpful. Very enjoyable."
"314.","MJ Zeek Daniels","360","2020-01-01","5","I've stayed here twice now. They have a cool rooftop bar with a great view of the Jakarta skyline. Staff is friendly, attentive and really make you feel welcomed. The lounge for Platinum Preferred Guests has a very limited selection which may disappoint some if you're used to the Le Méridien, JW Marriott or Keraton club lounges. Keraton isn't a fair comparison because it's Indonesia's finest. Nonetheless, still a great place to stay."
"315.","robert jackson","548","2020-01-01","5","This place was probably the poshest digs of my experience. Sorry, no pics of the breakfast buffet but it was fabulous! The chef prepared me a custom dish of poached eggs with spinach and other tasty trimmings on a delicious, crunchy sort of muffin. Best I've ever had. Fresh fruit juice, lots of bread, croissants, etc. Indonesian flavors were also on offer as well as smoked salmon, several types of cheese, fruit, etc.,. The hotel boasts a spa, rooftop pool, fitness room, and staff who are justifiably proud, kind, and happy. Will I go back? Absolutely! Fyi Relatively cheap and easy transfer from the airport by train to the hub at Manggarai station if you aren't too weighted down with luggage. Although there is a closer station to the hotel, if you do decide to go for it, the low cost of the taxi fare from Manggarai to this wonderful hotel makes that the most expeditious transfer, imho. (Tried it both ways.)"
"316.","Korniawan Prabowo","140","2018-01-01","4","Saat saya pertamakalinya masuk kedalam kamar dan menata baju-baju saya di lemari, tiba-tiba daun lemari di atas saya terlepas dan terjatuh. Hampir melukai kepala saya. Kejadian ini sungguh tidak menyenangkan bagi saya. Untung staff cepat tanggap untuk memperbaiki lemari tersebut dan menyarankan saya untuk pindah kamar ke kelas yang lebih tinggi. 3 hari saya bermalam di hotel ini, saya masih tetap bingung ketika akan ke lobby atau mencari lift karena bentuk hotel ini seperti labirin, penuh dengan pintu. Hotel ini bergaya klasik bangunan tua jaman belanda, sungguh exsotic. Satu hal yang saya suka adalah internetnya sungguh sangat kencang. Dan tidur saya sangat nyenyak di hotel ini."
"317.","Evan","507","2022-01-01","5","Salah satu dari sekian banyak hotel di kawasan Menteng yang bernuansa klasik... Berlokasi di area Menteng, Jakarta, bangunan yang menjadi focal point dari hotel ini merupakan peninggalan tahun 1923. Di masa itu, gedung tersebut berfungsi sebagai kantor telekomunikasi yang disebut `Telefoongebouw`. Seperti dikutip dari situs Jakarta.go.id, pada tahun 1945-1950, bangunan itu difungsikan sebagai kantor Badan Pekerja Komite Nasional Indonesia Pusat oleh Departement van Onderwijs en Eredienst. Kemudian menjadi Departemen Pendidikan dan Pengajaran pada tahun 1950, gedung itu beralih fungsi menjadi kantor Ditjen Kebudayaan atau Departemen P dan K sejak tahun 1968 hingga 1996. Selanjutnya, pada 1999 dipugar oleh Yayasan Universitas Bung Karno dan dimanfaatkan sebagai ruang kuliah. Sejak tahun 2014 , dialihfungsikan menjadi Hermitage, Tribute Hotel"

Definitely recommended but for some weird reason I cannot sleep well here I don't know why."

"324.","Taufan Yusuf Nugroho","283","2022-01-01","5","Hotel dan tempat pertemuan bergaya kolonial The Hermitage berada di kawasan Menteng, Jakarta. Kesan klasik masih terasa tetapi tak terkesan tua. Mungkin karena banyak pembaruan. Merunut historinya, gedung ini dibangun pada 1920-an. Pada 1923, bangunan tersebut merupakan pusat telekomunikasi pemerintahan kolonial. Kemudian di medio 2000-an beroperasi sebagai hotel The Hermitage. Kesan kolonial nan mewah ada di hotel tersebut. Keamanannya dapat dikatakan safe karena penjagaan berlapis."

I have to say the service quality is top-notch for Indonesian staffs in this property. They really train their employees well; not just on pre-arrival and check-out, but all throughout, in general. While the spread of breakfast at L'Avenue is not as wide due to its size, it is sufficient. The best part is that it is a cozy place, both for business and leisure. Hermitage Lounge is also nice. The only downside is the wine list is not extensive. Pricing is on the high side and they have good equipment (like crystal wine glass and decanter). Very pleasant stay. Cozy, comfortable, bright, and quiet. Would definitely return as a happy SPG member."

It's about 5 mins walk from Cikini Station and the place was really amazing with the colonial building design. When we entered the Hotel, 1 lovely staff greeted us and asked where were we going to. And they took us to the Hotel corridor which need an access card from the staff. The price was a bit pricey, but it was so much worth it with the view of Jakarta. The perfect time to come upstairs (to the bar) is during the sunset. Oh btw, if you want to sit on the couch then you'll need an advance booking and there is a minimum purchase if you want to book."

Thanks to Google maps which helpful to find the location, indeed. This overpriced hotel I believe is a sanctuary in the mid of traffic jungle in Jakarta. It's located on a quite road in Menteng, Central Jakarta. The most positive aspect about the location is the calm. Most luxury hotels in Jakarta are located right in the booming financial district. The other aspect is its historical building and all the stories written."

"378.","Happy Ferdian","270","2017-01-01","5","I think this is the only one boutique hotel in Jakarta which keeps its heritage building back then from early 1900s. The building was a Jakarta's Telegraph Office in the colonial era, and then it changed into public office before it was bought by Starwood Hotels and Resorts and rebuilt it as a five-star boutique hotel under The Portfolio Collection. The hotel has an extension building in its backyard with olympic size sky pool and sky bar with breathtaking view of the downtown of Jakarta. The rooms are designed with colonial aristocracy style which would bring us to feel the ambience of flapper living."

The building is in the older part of Jakarta, betweem Cikini, Pasar Surabaya and Cik Ditiro street. A white building with pillars, reminiscence of the colonial era. Greeter wearing Soekarno era uniform in the 1940s opens the car door. The lobby is not designed as a grand open lobby, but a tall ceiling with maps of old time Batavia (old name of Jakarta). On the sides are L'avenue resto. The corridors of the hotel is white, with black and white tiles, and furniture during the corresponding era. At the back is a garden with few benches. The balcony and hotel windows are nice. At the roof top is another resto and pool bar. The swimming pool is not too big, and the infinity effect was not so much impressive. But will be a lively and hip place at night. Nice to see art hotel in this city, and hope that it will last and contagious."

Gw jalan-jalan dari US, Rusia, eropa, Asia tengah, sekalinya disemprit sama sekuriti cuma di London karena pake tripod, dan di hotel ini sama waitresnya.😄 Untuk lain2nya biasa, kolam renang ga ada buat anak, dan kecil, kafe rooftop juga sempit, kamar bagus, tapi kamar mandi ga ada jet spray.

Pas sudha masuk ke dalam di cegat lagi ambil makanan di depan orang rame malu dong. . Dibilang bahwa hanya dapat makan 2 orang saja.. Saya bilang oke saya diskusi dulu keluar karena sy baru tau ada aturan d hotel nginap berdua 1 kamar yg makan cuma 1 kan lucu...

Dan yang lucu nya adalah udh masuk pula baru di larang ambil makanan kan ga ada etika -nya..Harusnya ber etika dan bersopan santun, panggil saya keluar dulu bukan ditegur depan orng banyak dan terdengar oleh orang tua saya lagi...kasihan mereka sudah tua dihitukan oleh pelayan hotel...malu kan mereka apalagi saya...apalagi kantor dan perusahaan saya sering rekanan meeting disini tidak pernah begini...

Serius, tengah malam saat tamu sedang tidur!! Ini pertama kalinya seseorang datang mengetuk pintu saya untuk membayar tagihan di tengah malam. Saya bertanya mengapa mereka tidak mengizinkan saya membayar saat check-out besok atau setidaknya di pagi hari saat sarapan, tetapi mereka hanya meminta maaf dan tidak bisa berbuat apa-apa. Gila."
"462.","Coralie Robert","4","2025-05-14","1","Kami memiliki pengalaman yang sangat buruk di hotel ini, yang menawarkan kualitas tinggi. Kami memesan kamar eksekutif dengan balkon pribadi selama menginap di Jakarta. Ruang tunggu eksekutif kualitasnya rata-rata dalam hal produk yang ditawarkan, tetapi layanannya baik. Sarapannya juga berkualitas baik dengan layanan yang baik. Namun, kami mengalami masalah besar saat bangun tidur. Ketika kami membuka tirai, kami mendapati beberapa pria di balkon, mungkin sedang merenovasi fasad. Sungguh mengejutkan mendapati diri kami berhadapan dengan orang asing bahkan sebelum berpakaian! Kami tidak menerima informasi sebelumnya, baik bahwa teras kami tidak dapat digunakan atau bahwa akan ada orang yang sedang mengerjakannya ketika kami bangun. Selain itu, kami tidak diberitahu sehari sebelumnya tentang kebisingan yang disebabkan oleh pekerjaan (pemasangan/pembongkaran perancah, pengeboran, dll.), yang sudah mengganggu kami sehari sebelumnya karena menghalangi kami untuk tidur siang saat tiba. Tapi itu tidak seberapa dibandingkan dengan kurangnya privasi. Perlukah saya sebutkan bahwa ini adalah bulan madu kami, mereka sudah tahu, tetapi tidak ada kompensasi, apalagi permintaan maaf! Setelah kembali ke resepsionis, mereka setuju memberi kami akses 30 menit ke Suite Eksekutif di sore hari... Situasi yang sangat bermasalah, di mana orang asing melihat kami telanjang saat bangun tidur, dan terutama kurangnya reaksi dan tindak lanjut, tampaknya jauh dari standar hotel, apalagi standar tinggi yang diklaim dijunjung tinggi oleh hotel ini. Kami telah memilih grup Marriott untuk berbagai tujuan, tetapi hal ini jelas mengguncang kepercayaan kami terhadap hotel ini."

"468.","Jasmine Chau","29","2025-01-14","1","Pengalaman yang Sangat Mengecewakan di Hotel The Hermitage, Jakarta Sebagai wisatawan yang sering bepergian dan pelanggan setia hotel bintang lima, saya memiliki ekspektasi tinggi terhadap pengalaman saya di Hotel The Hermitage. Sayangnya, kunjungan saya dirusak oleh serangkaian masalah yang membuat saya sangat tidak puas. Pertama-tama, saya ingin menyampaikan informasi menyesatkan yang diberikan selama proses pemesanan. Reservasi kami dengan jelas menyatakan bahwa kamar akan dilengkapi tempat tidur 3 meter yang luas dan mewah. Namun, setibanya di sana, kami terkejut mendapati diri kami ditempatkan di kamar dengan tempat tidur yang jauh lebih kecil. Perubahan tak terduga ini tidak hanya memengaruhi kenyamanan kami, tetapi juga membuat kami mempertanyakan keakuratan deskripsi daring Anda. Selain itu, sarapan yang disediakan di hotel Anda jauh dari memuaskan. Saya memesan susu panas, tetapi yang saya dapatkan justru susu kedelai hangat. Kurangnya perhatian terhadap detail dan ketidakpedulian terhadap preferensi tamu ini sungguh tidak dapat diterima untuk sebuah hotel bintang lima. Selain itu, meskipun kami telah berkali-kali meminta handuk kecil, handuk tersebut tidak pernah diantar ke kamar kami, membuat kami merasa tidak nyaman dan frustrasi. Namun, aspek yang paling mengecewakan dari kunjungan kami adalah sikap acuh tak acuh dan tidak profesional tim resepsionis dalam menangani keluhan kami. Kami menyampaikan keluhan pukul 19.30 sebelum pergi makan malam, dan kembali pukul 23.30 dengan tidak adanya kompensasi atau penyelesaian yang memadai. Kurangnya komunikasi yang efektif antara shift malam dan shift pagi sangat memprihatinkan dan mencerminkan buruknya manajemen Anda. Saat check-out pukul 09.00 keesokan harinya, saya didatangi oleh seorang staf bernama Nancy, yang tampaknya sama sekali tidak mengetahui keluhan kami sebelumnya. Ia bertanya apakah keluhan kami terkait AC, menunjukkan kurangnya koordinasi dan keseriusan dalam menangani keluhan klien. Ketidakpedulian terhadap umpan balik pelanggan seperti ini sungguh tidak dapat diterima. Mengingat potensi The Hermitage Hotel yang sangat besar, sungguh mengecewakan melihat kesenjangan yang begitu signifikan antara kondisinya saat ini dan standar tinggi yang diharapkan dari sebuah hotel bintang lima. Saya mendesak para pemilik dan manajemen untuk segera mengambil tindakan guna memperbaiki masalah ini. Sangat penting bagi Anda untuk menilai kembali kompetensi tim resepsionis dan melakukan perubahan yang diperlukan agar hotel Anda mencapai tingkat keunggulan yang dicita-citakan. Sebagai tamu yang tidak puas, saya merasa perlu berbagi pengalaman negatif saya dengan orang-orang di sekitar saya agar mereka tidak menginap di hotel yang tidak dapat diterima seperti ini. Saya sangat berharap masukan saya ditanggapi dengan serius dan langkah-langkah yang diperlukan segera diambil untuk mengatasi masalah yang diajukan. Dengan demikian, The Hermitage Hotel berpotensi menjadi hotel terbaik di kota ini, memberikan layanan yang luar biasa, dan melampaui harapan para tamunya yang cerdas."

"512.","Tias Ayu","12","2025-05-14","2","Pertama-tama, saya ingin mengucapkan terima kasih atas kamar yang bersih dan luas, serta kuenya. Sarapannya enak dan pelayannya ramah, tetapi variasinya tidak banyak. Namun, saya menulis ini untuk menyampaikan kekecewaan saya yang mendalam terkait beberapa insiden yang terjadi selama saya menginap di hotel Anda baru-baru ini: 1. Keterlambatan dan Miskomunikasi Layanan Laundry Saya menyerahkan cucian saya pada tanggal 22 April pukul 07.30, dengan harapan akan selesai pada hari yang sama seperti yang disebutkan. Namun, hingga pukul 19.00, saya belum menerimanya dan menghubungi resepsionis beberapa kali, hanya untuk diberi tahu harap tunggu. Akhirnya, saya dihubungkan ke bagian laundry, yang memberi tahu saya bahwa cucian belum siap. Cucian baru diantar keesokan paginya. Pada tanggal 23 April pukul 07.00, saya kembali bertanya tentang cucian tersebut dan diberi tahu bahwa cucian telah diantar oleh tim mereka. Saya menunggu selama 30 menit dan masih belum menerimanya. Hal ini membuat saya terlambat ke kantor dan terpaksa memakai kaos, karena semua kemeja saya ada di laundry. Saya merasa ini sangat tidak profesional dan membuat frustrasi—disuruh menunggu padahal layanan belum siap, membuang-buang waktu berharga yang seharusnya bisa saya gunakan untuk mempersiapkan hari saya. 2. Perlakuan yang Tidak Dapat Diterima Saya meninggalkan kamar lebih awal sementara ibu saya tetap di kamar. Ketika ia kemudian keluar kamar, ia diminta mengembalikan kunci kamar—sesuatu yang belum pernah saya temui di properti Marriott Bonvoy mana pun. Kemudian, ketika mencoba masuk kembali ke kamar, ia dihentikan dan staf bersikeras menelepon untuk mengonfirmasi apakah ia bisa diantar ke kamar. Perlakuan seperti ini membuatnya merasa seolah-olah sedang dicurigai. Rasanya tidak nyaman dan tidak dapat diterima. 3. Kerusakan Lift Pada tanggal 23 April pukul 18.30, lift sisi kiri di lantai pertama mengalami kerusakan. Meskipun tombol tutup sudah ditekan, pintunya berulang kali terbuka dan tertutup. Hal ini menimbulkan risiko keselamatan dan menunjukkan perawatan yang buruk. Sebagai tamu setia yang sering menginap di properti Marriott Bonvoy, pengalaman ini jauh di bawah standar yang saya harapkan. Saya harap pihak hotel menanggapi masukan ini dengan serius dan mengambil tindakan yang tepat untuk mengatasi masalah ini. Saya menantikan tanggapan dan solusi Anda atas masalah ini. Terima kasih."
"513.","Sara Higueras","32","2025-01-14","2","Saya bisa saja memberinya 4 bintang, bukan 2, tetapi ada insiden khusus yang terjadi di hotel ini yang menurut saya keterlaluan, yang akan saya ceritakan nanti. Lokasinya luar biasa, dan hotel ini merupakan karya seni yang kaya akan sejarah. Kamar-kamarnya luas dan sangat nyaman, dan stafnya, sebagian besar, ramah, meskipun agak kacau. Aspek negatifnya, dan inilah insidennya, adalah kami tiba dengan taksi dari bandara. Sopir taksinya adalah seorang pria yang sangat tua. Ketika ia hendak memasuki gedung, petugas keamanan (bukan yang membawa anjing, yang memang ramah, tetapi yang lain yang hanya berjaga di pintu) dengan kasar mengantarnya keluar, menatapnya dengan tatapan penuh penghinaan yang belum pernah saya saksikan. Sopir taksi kami yang malang itu berjalan perlahan, tidak tahu harus berbuat apa, dan kami benar-benar bingung (saya kira petugas keamanan itu tidak menyadari ada tamu hotel di dalam taksi). Sopir taksi malang itu terus melaju menuju gerbang kedua (gerbang keluar mobil), dan saya bisa melihat petugas keamanan masih menatap kami dengan jijik dan berbicara dengan seseorang di walkie-talkie-nya. Melihat ini, saya keluar dan menghadapinya (saat itulah dia jelas menyadari telah melakukan kesalahan). Selama sisa waktu menginap kami, dia bahkan tidak berani melihat kami, dan setiap kali kami lewat, dia bersembunyi. Kami tidak keberatan awalnya dia tidak mengizinkan kami masuk ke hotel; yang mengganggu saya adalah kurangnya rasa hormat yang dia tunjukkan kepada sopir taksi malang itu, yang dia diskriminasi dan perlakukan dengan hina, dengan asumsi dia ingin masuk ke hotel. Sebuah Hermitage bersikap seperti ini? Di sisi lain, ada beberapa masalah karena ketidakteraturan staf. Kami memesan pijat selama 1,5 jam untuk dua orang pada pukul 18.30 dan diberi tahu bahwa mereka akan datang ke kamar kami. Pukul 19.20, mereka menelepon dan bilang mereka akan terlambat. Mereka bertanya apakah kami keberatan, apakah pukul 19.30, lalu pukul 20.00, dan akhirnya pukul 21.00, yang kami tolak. Saya tidak mengerti bagaimana mereka bisa menjaga ketertiban di spa. Selebihnya, seperti yang sudah saya katakan, stafnya sangat sopan dan akomodatif. Kami memesan sarapan untuk dibawa pulang, dan semuanya sudah siap, dan kamarnya fantastis. Tapi saya tidak bisa melupakan insiden dengan pria di pintu..."
"514.","Ayda Kashivandi","52","2025-01-14","2","Hotel dengan layanan yang sangat baik untuk sarapan dan makan siang (sore). Layanan hotel ini bukan bintang 5. Mereka sangat lambat dan hampir tidak mengerti bahasa Inggris! (Saya tidak tahu apakah mereka berpura-pura atau apakah ini benar-benar masalah bahasa.) TV-nya tidak terhubung internet. Setelah saya sebutkan, mereka membawa perangkat, tetapi kami memiliki dua kamar dan perangkatnya hanya satu! Dan mereka tidak punya yang lain... AC-nya tidak berfungsi dengan baik... kebersihannya agak buruk, seprai agak bernoda. Tidak ada menu di kamar. Setelah memesan, menu tiba melalui WhatsApp setelah 40 menit. Sementara itu, kami turun dan mengambilnya sendiri! Makan siangnya sangat buruk dalam hal layanan, dan untuk hidangannya, kami berempat makan siang, jadi kami memesan semuanya bersama-sama, seperti biasa! Makanan semua orang datang terpisah! Sementara suami saya menghabiskan supnya, salad saya datang tanpa saus (sausnya datang setelah saya menghabiskan salad saya). Satu jam kemudian, hidangan ibuku datang, lalu hidangan ayahku! Buruk sekali... daging suamiku tak kunjung datang, dan kami pergi setelah 2 jam! Manajernya minta maaf dan bersikeras menawarkan koktail. Begitu kami pergi, mereka malah menyuruh kami membayar koktailnya!!! (Ngapain pura-pura!!!) Lagipula, mereka tidak punya koktail yang enak; cuma air putih dan es, tidak sepadan! Mereka perlu meningkatkan pelayanan, kebersihan, dan kesopanannya. INI BUKAN BINTANG 5, meskipun kamu bayar untuk bintang 5!"
"515.","Alex Lindsay","96","2025-02-14","2","Saya sudah dua kali menginap di sini dan mengira sudah menemukan hotel yang bagus di Jakarta, tapi tidak ada air panas, ada cipratan misterius di seluruh dinding, dan tidak bisa menghubungkan komputer ke internet seperti biasa, dan harus menunggu lama sampai ada yang datang memperbaikinya, sungguh, pencarian terus berlanjut. Bahkan Motel 6 pun bisa menyediakan air panas dan internet. Entah bagaimana kami bisa sampai di hotel bintang 5 di sini. Di bawah ini foto keran air panas yang menyala penuh, dengan tetesan air hangatnya yang kecil. Butuh waktu lebih dari satu jam untuk mengisi bak mandi. Ini setelah mereka memperbaikinya."
"516.","nur aliah","42","2025-01-14","2","Tinggal di sini selama 3 malam dengan suami saya. Hotelnya asri dan lokasinya dekat dengan kawasan CBD Jakarta. Semua staf menyenangkan, sangat ramah dan membantu. Kamarnya bersih dan indah. 2 bintang karena prasmanannya mengandung daging babi. Sarapan prasmanan dan menu dalam kamar mengandung daging babi. Kami mencoba mengonfirmasi dengan dapur mereka apakah itu dari restoran terpisah, tetapi dapur memberi tahu kami bahwa itu berasal dari restoran yang sama tahun 1928. Namun dapur menyebutkan kepada kami bahwa daging mereka berasal dari sumber halal. Saya juga tidak yakin hal ini normal di Indonesia karena saya berasal dari Malaysia dan kami memiliki pedoman ketat mengenai makanan halal. Pemasakan dan penyiapan bahan halal dan non halal perlu dipisahkan. Di Malaysia mereka tidak bisa mengklaim halal jika mereka menyajikan daging babi di restoran yang sama. Salah satu alasan kami memesan hotel ini karena kami melihat situs pemesanan halal hotel ini di Indonesia dan situs tersebut menyebutkan semua makanannya halal. Jadi kami sangat kecewa saat melihat daging babi di menu mereka. Hal ini juga menyulitkan kami dalam mencari alternatif sarapan karena kami tidak percaya diri untuk menyantap buffetnya. Selain itu, kami puas dengan hotelnya."

AC di kamar sangat panas, dingin di ruang tamu.. kamar mandi.. hanya handuk yang diganti tidak disedot debu atau dibersihkan secara menyeluruh yang merupakan hal terpenting di hotel mana pun untuk dibersihkan dengan sangat baik. Staf memiliki masalah besar dalam progres pembersihan yang membuat saya sangat kecewa dan jijik.. terasnya, dibersihkan dengan sangat sederhana... kamarnya banyak orang menginap di sana.. jadi pembersihan adalah prioritas pertama untuk pengunjung berikutnya. Hotelnya bagus dan unik.. tetapi hal-hal ini merusak keseluruhan citra.. Hal lainnya, saya bangun terlambat, dan saya ingin sarapan ala Amerika. Sangat mudah dilakukan.. yang mana koki bersikeras bahwa waktunya sudah habis dan dia tidak bisa memasak telur mata sapi, yang mana saya tidak memintanya secara gratis. Saya yang membayarnya. Selama bahan-bahan dasarnya tersedia, seorang koki hebat tidak akan ragu untuk memuaskan tamu hotel. Saya rasa staf perlu belajar bagaimana menjadi kreatif dan memecahkan masalah, bukan menghafal SOP, khususnya dalam hal layanan tamu (khususnya grup hotel Marriott)."

"520.","Sarah Humaira","3","2025-01-14","2","Pengalaman saya di hotel ini, terutama di momen penting seperti pernikahan dan bulan madu, jauh dari memuaskan. Meskipun sudah memasukkan cucian saya ke dalam tas yang disediakan, setelah ditanya, saya malah diberikan pakaian orang lain. Kebingungan seputar pergantian kamar menambah stres yang tak perlu. Awalnya diarahkan ke lantai tiga, suami saya kemudian ditempatkan di lantai lima, yang menyebabkan ketidaknyamanan lebih lanjut. Sebelum check-out, saya mendapati bukan hanya cucian saya yang tidak tercatat, tetapi barang-barang pribadi saya, termasuk sepatu hak tinggi saya yang tertinggal di laci kamar bulan madu, juga terabaikan selama proses pengembalian. Kurangnya komunikasi mengenai barang-barang kami sangat mengecewakan. Baru setelah ditindaklanjuti secara terus-menerus, mereka mengonfirmasi pengembalian sepatu hak tinggi saya, meskipun dengan penundaan dan permintaan bukti tambahan. Sebagai seorang pengantin yang akan berbulan madu, saya mengharapkan pengalaman yang lancar dan penuh perhatian, namun selalu menemui kekecewaan. Kelalaian dan penundaan seperti itu merusak acara yang seharusnya membahagiakan. Peningkatan dalam komunikasi, perhatian terhadap detail, dan akuntabilitas sangat penting untuk memenuhi harapan para tamu, terutama pada momen-momen penting seperti ini."

Ketika diminta merekomendasikan minuman, dia bahkan tidak mau menjelaskan, hanya mengulang nama-nama minuman seolah-olah silver moon sudah cukup menjelaskan. Sementara itu, sekelompok siswa SMA di Indonesia berteriak-teriak dengan keras, tetapi dia bahkan tidak meminta mereka untuk lebih tenang. Saya sungguh tidak akan merekomendasikan layanan pelanggan staf, terutama mengingat ini seharusnya hotel bintang lima."

Ini membuat saya tidak nyaman di lobi karena waktu tunggu yang sangat lama karena antrean yang tersebar untuk check-in. Mereka tidak memiliki area yang tepat untuk check-in dan mengantre. Staf pada waktu check-in saya tidak memberikan layanan yang baik bagi saya yang telah menunggu lama sambil berdiri. Mereka melayani orang yang datang pertama ke meja, bukan orang yang datang pertama. Ini membuat saya cukup kesal. Resepsionis juga menangani bagasi yang seharusnya ditangani oleh petugas concierge. Kekecewaan lainnya adalah restorannya yang sangat kompak (kecil) sehingga hanya memiliki sedikit variasi makanan. Sebenarnya makanannya cukup enak, tetapi tidak ramai. Terkadang sedikit bau rokok memasuki restoran. Untuk ruang pertemuan, mereka hanya menawarkan 2 jenis makanan ringan dengan buah-buahan dan kopi. Tidak terlalu buruk, hanya standar. Untuk kamar, sejujurnya kamarnya lumayan, Anda akan memiliki ruang tamu terpisah, yang membuatnya lebih privat di area tempat tidur."

Suasananya kacau, prasmanannya disajikan dengan tidak menarik, dan hanya hidangan yang bisa dipesan yang enak."

Saya check-in pukul 12.00 siang dan pergi untuk rapat bisnis pukul 14.30. Tiba-tiba, saya melihat bengkak merah di lengan saya. Saya tidak yakin apakah itu reaksi alergi atau gigitan serangga, tetapi saya yakin lengan saya baik-baik saja saat check-in. Selama di kamar, saya duduk di sofa dan menggunakan meja sebentar. Saya melaporkan masalah ini kepada manajer hotel, tetapi mereka tidak dapat menawarkan bantuan apa pun selain menelepon rumah sakit terdekat untuk membuat janji temu. Hotel juga tidak menyediakan kotak P3K atau fasilitas medis apa pun."
"585.","Bernhard Berwik","17","2025-02-14","3","Hotel dan kamarnya sungguh indah, dengan segala fasilitas yang tersedia. Restoran hotel menawarkan pilihan makanan lokal dan Barat yang lezat. Namun, saya harus bilang Anda akan menemukan kualitas yang sama di restoran-restoran di sekitarnya dengan harga yang jauh lebih terjangkau. Selama kami menginap, atap hotel sedang direnovasi, jadi kami tidak bisa sepenuhnya menikmati pemandangan dan kafe di atasnya. Namun, pemandangan dari hotel tetap sangat layak dikunjungi. Alasan saya hanya bisa memberikan 3 bintang adalah karena pengalaman sarapan di hari terakhir kami menginap. Karena hari sebelumnya hotel mengadakan pernikahan, banyak tamu yang menginap sehingga sarapan di hari berikutnya penuh sesak. Kami pergi untuk sarapan pukul 9 pagi di hari Minggu dan saat itu tidak ada meja yang tersedia di restoran lagi, jadi kami pergi ke area lounge. Karena ada ruang cerutu di sebelahnya, aroma cerutu tercium dan rasanya kurang cocok untuk memulai hari sambil menikmati sarapan. Selain itu, masalah utamanya adalah staf dan manajemen tampaknya tidak siap menghadapi tamu sebanyak ini. Meskipun Anda mungkin mengira mereka menyelenggarakan pernikahan secara rutin dan jumlah tamu yang datang tidak mengejutkan, sarapannya tetap saja berantakan, karena staf tidak sempat mengisi prasmanan atau membersihkan area tepat waktu. Akibatnya, para tamu kurang lebih harus berurusan dengan sisa makanan, dan dibandingkan dengan hari sebelumnya, sungguh mengecewakan. Untuk sarapan, tamu juga dapat memilih menu a la carte, tetapi kami harus mengulangi pesanan kami empat kali kepada staf layanan yang berbeda sebelum akhirnya tiba setelah satu jam. Kami langsung mengajukan keluhan kepada manajer dan saya berharap mereka akan melakukan perbaikan yang diperlukan karena pengalaman ini tidak memenuhi standar akomodasi yang luar biasa."
"586.","John Sharp","207","2024-01-14","3","Kamar bintang 5, tapi hati-hati - makanan hotelnya sangat buruk - sarapannya buruk sekali - kami akhirnya makan di tempat lain setelah hari pertama, meskipun gratis. Ada beberapa hal aneh lainnya tentang properti ini - halaman lobinya bisa saja megah, tetapi malah terbengkalai. Seharusnya ada satu atau dua meja di depan, tetapi tidak ada. Akibatnya, tidak ada tempat duduk yang nyaman - selain di kamar atau di atap yang sangat kecil - yang sungguh menyia-nyiakan bangunan megah ini. Dengan potensi yang begitu besar, hotel ini bisa dijadikan hotel terbaik di kota. Pemiliknya harus memperhatikan, mengganti manajemen F&B, dan meningkatkan kualitas restoran ke standar yang lebih tinggi sebagai langkah awal."
"587.","Dr. Nugroho","408","2023-01-14","3","Menghadiri pesta pernikahan di restoran hotel. Beri saja 3 bintang. Alasannya begini: apa yang orang harapkan dari sebuah pesta? Makanan enak? Tidak. Kita bisa menemukan makanan yang lebih enak di luar sana. Melihat kemegahan interiornya? Tidak. Untuk apa? Mendengarkan band musik? Tidak. Kita berkumpul untuk mengobrol. Itulah hal terpenting dalam sebuah pesta. Mengobrol dengan keluarga dan teman. Tapi apa yang terjadi? Saya bahkan kesulitan berbicara dengan orang yang duduk di sebelah saya. Musiknya sangat keras. Saya mengeluh kepada salah satu orang di sana. Mereka tidak menghiraukan... Banyak wedding organizer gagal memahami aturan dasar yang penting ini. Bukan hanya kali ini. Sekali lagi, orang datang bukan untuk menonton konser, melainkan untuk mengobrol... Soal makanannya, itu hanya makanan hotel biasa. Standar saja. Lagipula, ulasan ini sebagian besar ditujukan untuk pihak penyelenggara, bukan pihak hotel itu sendiri."
"588.","parvind saini","33","2024-01-14","3","Layanan di klub dan di tempat lain sangat baik. Sarapan di hari kedua sangat baik setelah kami pergi dengan rekomendasi staf. Satu-satunya masalah yang membuat saya memberikan rekomendasi buruk adalah kami terkunci di luar kamar kami pada hari terakhir ketika kami pergi untuk sarapan. Itu seharusnya tidak pernah terjadi di properti bintang 5. Ketika saya pergi ke meja depan ditanya jam berapa kami akan check out sebelum mengaktifkan kartu. Itu mencerminkan hal yang buruk, ketika waktu check out adalah pukul 12, bahkan belum pukul 9 pagi dan kartu dinonaktifkan. Dan kami ingin pergi sebelum pukul 11, jadi mengapa menonaktifkan kartu? Apa pun penyebabnya, semoga pihak hotel dapat mengatasi penyebabnya. Jika tidak, masa inapnya sangat baik dan stafnya sangat ramah dan membantu. Saya merasa tidak enak memberikan peringkat buruk tetapi itu lebih untuk perubahan yang diperlukan di hotel yang seharusnya sangat baik."

Tujuan saya ke sana hanya untuk pijat, bukan untuk melakukan hal-hal yang tidak pantas atau cabul. Saya datang ke Indonesia bersama keluarga untuk bekerja dan berbisnis."

"591.","Ryzky Yudha (Ryu)","49","2023-01-14","3","Kamar bertema kolonial yang bagus dengan bathtub yang menghadap ke jalan, hanya itu saja. Tim resepsionis check-in sangat buruk, mereka bahkan tidak repot-repot menjelaskan cara menuju kamar, meskipun tata letaknya sangat membingungkan dengan begitu banyak lorong sempit dan pintu-pintu serupa yang seringkali tidak memiliki petunjuk arah/panduan yang jelas. Jadi saya dan teman-teman harus membawa tas berkeliling lobi. Saya sudah mengeluh ke layanan pelanggan, manajernya meminta maaf, tetapi resepsionis bahkan tidak mengatakan sepatah kata pun ketika saya check-out. Dan bersiaplah untuk menjadi lebih membingungkan dengan kerumunan orang dari acara pernikahan dan bazar yang acak yang mereka adakan di aula kecil. Selama dua malam saya di sana, setidaknya untuk 4 acara berbeda. Dan bersiaplah untuk kebisingan dari truk bongkar muat larut malam."
