"1.","Vivian Octariana","4","2025-12-25","5","Great hotel with a comfortable & pleasant atmosphere at Movenpick Jakarta City Center, making our stay truly enjoyable. The breakfast was good with nice options, and the chocolate hour was absolutely delicious and a lovely highlight of our stay. Special thanks to Ruth Desy (Duty Manager) and Abigail (GRO) for their warm and professional service. Appreciation also to the housekeeping team for preparing the beautiful art towel. Overall, a wonderful experience and highly recommended!✨👍"
"2.","Max Radzion","24","2025-12-01","5","I stayed at the Mövenpick Hotel for two nights during a holiday trip, and overall it was a very pleasant experience. The room was spacious and clean, perfectly suited for two people, and the separate beds made it especially comfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful throughout my stay, which added to the welcoming atmosphere. Breakfast was good as well—occasionally a bit busy, but overall very satisfying with plenty of choice. The location was another great advantage. It’s close to the city center and easily accessible, making it a convenient base for exploring the area."
"3.","Alfred Tan","15","2025-12-01","4","I’ve stayed at Movenpick Jakarta City Centre four times since its opening in June 2024. While the executive lounge is still not open, what keeps me coming back is not the facilities—but the incredible team. From the warm welcome by Duty Manager Ruth and Senior Guest Experience Officer Reho, to the outstanding service at Ginger Flower by Dede, Malik, and Darryl, every interaction reflects genuine care. At the bar, Vira and Anwar made my evening drinks feel personal and memorable. This hotel shines because of its people. Thank you all for making each stay feel like coming home. Looking forward to the day the lounge officially opens—but until then, it’s your hospitality that truly sets the standard."
"4.","Dhamar Ramadhani","4","2025-12-25","5","One of the best hotel in central Jakarta. Dimulai dari makanannya yang semuanya panas, fresh dan enaknya pake banget.

Kasurnya empuuuukkkkk.. gokil ini. Design bangunannya kelasssss sekalii.. terbaiiikkkk memang hotel ini.. terima kasih Movenpick."
"5.","Patrice Tan","35","2025-09-01","5","We got upgraded to suite, and they prepared a mirror art decoration to celebrate my job promotion which we appreciated (thanks Dina & Abigail~). The executive lounge wasn’t open for guests yet though, so they moved the evening cocktail hour to Wilde Cut restaurant. All the food and dessert we had during our stay was more than satisfactory. From the welcome drink, afternoon tea, chocolate hour, evening cocktail, and breakfast, everything was scrumptious (I think we gained some kilograms lol)! We also tried their Chinese restaurant, Song Xiang Lou, and it was also nice. Room was clean and comfortable, AC was cold. The towel decoration on our bed was really cute. I think they also upgraded the soundproofing since my previous stay last July because I finally slept like a baby during this recent stay (previously I couldn’t sleep due to the mosque being right outside the room window). The pool was somewhat small but it’s understandable, but the gym facilities certainly made up for it. The staffs were all friendly and helpful. Ms. Tamara Audy, the Guest Experience Manager, cheerfully welcomed me upon check-in. The huge teddy bears on the hotel lobby added a cute touch. Also, the hotel location being in Pecenongan means there are all sorts of tempting local cuisine all within walking distance! So be prepared to gain some kgs if you skip the pool and gym lol Overall I would recommend this hotel to my friends and colleagues. Will stay again for sure!"
"6.","Darrick Wong","6","2025-12-18","4","I have always stayed in Mövenpick for many years. Staffs are friendly and rooms are clean. Only this time a little displeasure on the ground floor gate, the staff refused to let me go through the right gate when I wanted to go out to the right side for dinner. For years it was fine, and Staffs greeted with smiles. Now, I had to walk all the way to the left gate, and walk all the way back pass the right gate, almost a 100 metres extra distance. I know it is trying to improve standard procedures, but this inflexibility is illogical and honestly quite annoying. Other than this, the stays have always been pleasant."
"7.","BMA","171","2025-12-04","5","Saya mampir ke Mövenpick Pecenongan untuk makan di restorannya dan kesan pertamanya langsung terasa kelasnya. Begitu masuk ke lobby suasananya modern dan rapi. Area hotel terlihat bersih dan pencahayaannya hangat sehingga memberi kesan nyaman sejak awal. Interior hotelnya benar benar cantik. Furniturnya rapi, warnanya elegan, dan semua sudut terlihat terawat. Tidak ada area yang terlihat kusam. Dari lantai hingga dekorasi dinding semuanya terasa premium. Walaupun hanya lewat menuju restoran saya sudah bisa merasakan kualitas hotel bintang tinggi. Restorannya juga nyaman sekali. Ruang makannya luas dan tertata dengan baik. Tempat duduknya empuk dan pencahayaan lembut membuat suasana makan terasa santai. Stafnya ramah dan sigap sehingga pengalaman makannya terasa makin enak. Hal yang paling saya suka adalah suasananya yang tenang. Walaupun berada di pusat kota hotel ini tidak terasa bising. Udara dalam ruangannya sejuk dan segar membuat makan santai terasa menyenangkan. Jika mencari restoran dengan suasana elegan dan interior yang benar benar enak dilihat Mövenpick Pecenongan sangat cocok. Meskipun saya tidak menginap pengalaman makan di sini saja sudah memberi gambaran bahwa hotel ini punya standar yang bagus. Cocok untuk makan santai atau sekadar menikmati suasana hotel yang rapi dan nyaman."

We were warmly welcomed by the Front Office team, especially Mr. Reho and Ms. Olivia, who were both very friendly and helpful. At the restaurant, we received excellent service — special thanks to Ms. Susi for her cheerful smile and kind assistance. Thank you to the whole team for making our stay enjoyable"
"9.","Indah M","1","2025-10-01","5","I had an exceptional stay at Mövenpick Pecenongan Jakarta, a true 5-star hotel that delivers on every level. From the moment I arrived, the service was impeccable—friendly, professional, and always attentive to every detail. One of the highlights of my stay was dining at La Floriane Bistro, one of the hotel’s signature restaurants. The food was absolutely delicious, with a great selection of dishes crafted to perfection. The service at the restaurant was equally outstanding—warm, efficient, and made the dining experience truly memorable. Highly recommended for both business and leisure travelers looking for comfort, premium, and top-tier hospitality in the heart of Jakarta."
"10.","Joanna Navarro","39","2025-11-01","5","I had a fantastic stay at the Mövenpick Hotel. It’s one of my favorite hotels yet. The staff were very professional and provided a wonderful, luxurious experience. The entire hotel appears new and stylish. There are several dining venues on site. I loved the breakfast buffet! It was huge and all of the food was fresh and delicious, the best breakfast buffet I have ever had. They also have a “chocolate hour” where they serve unlimited small desserts. The room was very clean and comfortable. Bed was great, AC was very strong, huge TV. Gym was well appointed. There’s also a nice pool on level 6 with pool games and an outdoor air cooler."
"11.","Johnii Liu","21","2025-08-01","5","I had an excellent stay at Mövenpick Jakarta City Centre. The hotel is conveniently located near the National Monument, making it easy to explore the city. Facilities are modern and well-equipped, and the staff were consistently warm and enthusiastic. Everyone we met was welcoming, especially the front desk staff. Check-in was efficient, and the team clearly explained the hotel amenities and Platinum benefits—many thanks for the complimentary room upgrade. During check-out, another staff member kindly assisted in Chinese, making the process smooth and pleasant. The suite was clean, well-maintained, and located on a high floor with great views. Cleanliness throughout the hotel was top-notch, and the teddy bear-themed decor in public areas created a cozy atmosphere. The jungle bird-themed café was also a highlight. Breakfast was excellent, offering a wide range of local and international options. The only minor downside was the limited selection during happy hour—both drinks and food options were a bit sparse. Perhaps this is due to the executive lounge not being fully set up yet, and I hope to see improvements in this area in the future. Overall, the hotel offers outstanding value for money and is a great choice for both leisure and business stays."
"12.","Reyno B. Haryono","170","2025-12-01","4","seluruh staff sangat baik dan membantu kamar luar biasa nyaman makanan sangat lezat security di parkiran lantai P2 atau P3 (lupa) sangat ramah. ada 1 yg kurang, security yg jaga di pintu masuk pada saat malam hari. beliau ngomong, bentar2 mau kekamar berapa, lohhhhhhhhh bukannya hotel tempat umum ya apalagi buat tamu? gak semuanya ke hotel harus nginep kan, bisa ke resto atau ke bar? kenapa nanya mau kekamar berapa? apa mungkin karna penampilan kami tidak pakai jas atau tuxedo atau kemeja? apa karna kami malam2 keliling pecenongan gak pake mobil, lagian ngapain pake mobil hanya keliling jalan didepan hotel. mungkin harus ada training hospitality lg buat securitynya, jangan menjudge org dari penampilan aja. guest is still a guest, good services for every guest at 5 star hotel is a mandatory."
"13.","Eva Margreth","13","2025-12-11","5","Kamar dan fasilitasnya ok, tp koq pintu kamar mandinya pas disamping kasur ya..ga seperti hotel2 biasanya. Jd kalau mau ke kamar mandi hrs lewat samping kasur sebelah dulu, jd agak kurang nyaman utk yg tidur disitu krn bolak balik dilewatin. Utk makanannya enak, variatif. Fasilitas ok."
"14.","Alexis Anthony","7","2025-09-01","5","- The staff were amazing; super friendly and helpful and very professional. - The hotel interior is very modern and very clean, everything was top notch. - The room was super comfortable with a very large smart TV with Netflix. - The breakfast was incredible; there were so many options that in 3 days we were not able to try something from every station. There are options from many different types of cuisine and everything was fresh and very delicious. - We tried two of the hotel restaurants (many different options) and both (one European style, the other Chinese style) were excellent and especially for the very reasonable prices. - The fitness center was great and is open 24 hours. - The pool is large enough to get a good workout."
"15.","Erlis Fitriana","2","2025-12-04","5","Ruang Meetingnya sangat baik, dengan fasilitas yang juga baik. Mushola dan Toiletnya tidak jauh dari ruang Meeting. Snack Coffee breaknya sangat enak. Pelayanannya juga sangat memuaskan, mulai dari security, resepsionis, sampai banquet nya semua sangat ramah dan sangat membantu."
"16.","Wednes Aria Yuda","125","2025-11-01","5","Kamarnya luas dengan bantal yang empuk sekali. Makanannya sangat boleh dipoedjikan. Staf sangat ramah mulai dari keamanan, lobby, FO, resto sampai banquet. Aroma di area kamar juga sangat menyenangkan. Wangi dari sabun mandinya sangat khas yang menyenangkan. Aroma Woody yang hangat dan memenangkan. Amenitisnya juga lengkap. Fasilitas olahraganya lengkap juga. Sangat recommended hotelnya nih. Kalau boleh memberi masukan, dari seluruh kelebihan di atas, kalau ada yang kurang hanya kopi di kamarnya yang kurang cakep. Sekalipun menggunakan mesin kopi, tapi kopi yang disajikan (saya dapat kopi gayo) tidak secantik biasanya bahkan cenderung plain."
"17.","Karen Suryono","2","2025-08-01","5","I just wanted to extend my heartfelt thanks for the wonderful stay I had at your hotel recently. The service throughout was excellent, and I especially loved the Chocolate Hour, such a delightful and unique touch! The breakfast selection was also fantastic, with great variety and quality that made each morning a treat. A special thank you to Audi for the warm hospitality, it truly made the experience even more memorable. I’ll definitely be back soon!"
"18.","Azharia Devi","5","2025-10-01","1","dapet pengalaman gak enak di hotel ini. Claimnya bintang 5 tp attitude pegawainya bintang 1. 1. Saat datang, dan tas masuk X-ray, petugas keamanan bilang Ibu, ini tas nya ada pistolnya ya, padahal dia bisa lihat dimonitor loh, sangat gak enak bgt dituduh seperti itu dan gak ada permintaan maaf. 2. Resepsionis tidak ramah, dan bahasa yang digunakan tdk enak, seolah menyalahkan tamu yg datang. 3. saya sewa meeting room, after break ruangan tidak dicleaning. Pas minta ke petugasnya utk dibersihkan, masnya seolah terpaksa dan grabak grubuk saat merefill minuman. Pintu dibanting saat kita lagi meeting. 4. lunch dan dinner di resto jg tidak langsung direfill, padahal saat itu kami lunch pk 13.00-an dan dinner pk 19.30-an. Dari sisi kamar sih oke, interior bagus, tp overall pelayanan dari petugas yang seperti ini bikin trauma mau nginep disini. Sorry to say aku ga akan nginep disini lagi."
"19.","Fitri Asih","3","2025-10-01","5","My stay at Movenpick jakarta was fantastic. The rooms were incredibly comfortable and elegantly decorated. I was particularly impressed by the efficient check-in/check-out process and the top-notch amenities, including a serene pool area and a well-equipped gym. The attentive staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome, and nothing was too much trouble for them."

"23.","Indra Nurramdhani","1","2025-11-01","5","My company organized a meeting at the Movenpick Hotel Jakarta. The meeting room was excellent, the food was delicious, the Wi-Fi connection was fast, and the hotel was very clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere was relaxing. Overall, it was a great experience and I highly recommend this hotel for business events."
"24.","Daniel Jiang","36","2025-12-11","2","Nice location, right at the heart of street food scene in Jakarta. The hotel was built in the early 2000s and has switched management for at least twice. After the recent major renovation, the hotel feels new from afar but many details fall short. First, the guest room door feels old without any new locking system. Once, my door was not locked properly for hours after the staff entered while I was not there because the chain lock head was stuck at the door gap. Looking at the scratches around the door, it is possible that this happen often. This is a major security issue especially with my belongings just being left in the room. Second, the bathroom floor material is very slippery when wet. The solution given was additional rubber bath mat that feels awful to step on and very dirty with all the gunk sticking under the mat, which I believe was never cleaned. The similar mat was also used in the bathtub which make it very unhygienic. You can at least use a proper transparent 3M shower strip to add grip without sacrificing hygiene and aesthetic. Bath amenities was quite questionable without any brand for its bulk sized bottles. Bed linen has questionable stains and there was no pillow selection. The room itself was mostly decent. It was just a let down that the smart TV does not have additional connectivity for Apple products. The room floor corridor sometimes gives out too much perfumed scent that sting. While the hotel advertise an executive lounge, there was none at the property and somehow there won't be any. Suite guests and Platinum Members will only be given meal services like afternoon tea and cocktail hours in the restaurant area. There are no lounge that guests could visit at any time during their stay. Now the service. while the checking in process was smooth, beyond that everything went awry. I asked to pick up laundry one evening, no one showed up for more than 30 minutes. It was after I called back that the staff finally picked it up. During breakfast, ordering a la carte menu was painfully long to wait. Once, my satay order did not come up after more than 30 mins, I was quite in a rush so I decided to leave. Complete staffs were rarely standing by at the reception, many times I saw only one or two staffs handling many guests which ended up people queing for too long. There were almost not a single time I saw any staff member handling the Accor member desk. As a Platinum member, the 2pm late check out was not available, although, I was given an early 11am check in the days before. While the hotel has potentials, it seems like many things are overlooked in terms of making it a decent property to leisurely stay in. Mind you this hotel has been operating for more than one year, so there should be many feedbacks that could potentially bring improvements towards their services, but somehow it is the reality. For a business stay, this might be an OK hotel to choose, but for a vacation, especially staying in, there are too many better hotel to choose in Jakarta."
"25.","Kevin Kris","5","2025-11-01","4","Pengalaman Menginap yang baik – Sarapan Lezat & Lokasi Strategis! Saya menginap selama 3 malam di hotel ini dan sangat puas dengan pengalaman yang saya dapatkan. Lokasinya sangat strategis, hanya sekitar 5 menit dengan mobil dari Monas. Kamar yang saya tempati luas dan modern, tetapi terdapat bau pada kamar mandi. Saat pagi, saya menikmati sarapan di restoran hotel yang menyajikan berbagai pilihan makanan."
"26.","Rere here","4","2025-12-01","3","This is my review for my pov, hope you kindly understanding : Pros : The food its really good and good for the room Cons : - Should have more people on the kitchen for make dessert on the weekend, because i wait to long to have the dessert, in the end i didnt wait, my mood become worsed. - Do we have to refill it ourselves for mineral water? Because i didnt see mineral water besides on the all drinks. Its just infuse water. - its such disappointing i cannot take away a drink on the breakfast because the drink is really good. Truthly i dont want to review this, but because i wait to longg my mood really bad."

My room was spacious and spotlessly clean. The breakfast buffet was large and extensive. There are good dining options for lunch and dinner too. The staff were very welcoming and aimed to please."

"30.","Rio","8","2025-10-01","1","Ditanya password WiFi ruang meeting, petugas kekeh bgt kalau mesti log in as member accor. Kalau bukan member accor terus gimana? Harusnya WiFi sudah jadi bagian dari fasilitas meeting dong terlepas member atau bukan. Yg paling parah lagi, kami bawa kotakan snack dan kopi dari luar hotel untuk dimakan bareng di ruang meeting, dicharge extra 50rb per kotak, baru kali ini punya pengalaman meeting package di hotel ada yg seperti ini. Definitely will not come back and will not reccomend people here to have meetings."

"35.","Chris Simon Sihombing","10","2025-09-01","1","W pagi-pagi bawa motor, terus kartu uang elektronik w pas tab taunya sudah terdaftar dan kendaraan sudah didalam parkir. Security datang bukannya bantuin malah suruh w parkir diluar, dipinggir jalan (kesel banget, bukannya dibantuin malah kayak ngusir w parkir diluar, yang bermasalah mesin parkirnya kenapa w disuruh parkir diluar), akhirnya w parkir diluar, dipinggir jalan sebrang hotel karena w ada meeting pagi biar gak lama dan males berdebat. Pas udah w parkir diluar w tanya reseptionya, terus dibantuin karena petugas parkir tidak stand by di hotel. Pas udah bisa w diminta ambil kartu parkir w dan katanya w masuknya gak perlu di tap di gerbang masuk, jam 11 siang w masukin deh tuh motor w pas mau pulang w tanya lagi, kartu saya sudah bisa kan? Sudah terdaftar kan, pas jam 17.50 w keluar kena charge parking. W tanya reseptionnya by chat katanya karena w keluar lwt gerbang mobil. Kalo dihitung2 w harusnya bayar parkir 7 jam, tapi masa w bayar parkir 3 jam 50 menit dan terdaftarnya kartu w itu mobil. Gimana menurut kalian?"

"41.","Pei-chih Lin","394","2025-09-01","4","The service, breakfast and room are good. However, the location is not safe according to the local froends' opinions. The traffice around here is also busy. In the room, the humidity is relative high. If there is a dehumidifier will be good. This hotel still provide guest room amenities such as toothbrush and others. Moreover, there could be some minor mistakes about the room cleaning, for example, there are stains on the towels and finger prints on the mirror. The bar on the G floor is friendly and nice. The gym is open for 24 hours on the 6 floor. Sometimes the gym staff comes to ask the room number to make sure the gym user is the customer in this hotel. But it will be better if the staff can do it while I stop running instead of while running. There is a chocolate time from 4 to 5 pm everyday."

And it was definitely made more memorable with excellent service and assistance from Ms Tamara who tried to accommodate all our requests to perfection. One small suggestion I might have is to consider updating the children's playground. It would be wonderful to see a more oganized toys placement and overall well-planned layout that could really bring the space to life."

But every time we came back after a long day, a large group would monopolize the elevators. This happened on both the nights we stayed at the property. Plus there were definitely other breakfast options available in the area, but the concierge said only the on-site restaurant was available."

"56.","Pria Ardhisalam","10","2025-08-01","5","1. Mudah mencari makanan karena dekat dengan tempat kuliner 2. Kamar Bersih & wangi setiap hari 3. Pada saat Cekin FO yg sangat membantu yg perempuan masukan agar FO laki-laki yg menggunakan kacamata Hospitality nya agak kurang sepertinya sudah senior padahal sekelas 5 star sehingga saya memilih yg perempuan. 4. Pada saat Breakfast ada salah satu Waitress Minta Air Putih malah memilih setup meja bukan mengutamakan isi ulang air bagaimana jika tamu tersedak karena air putih kami habis. 5. Untuk Bagian Room Division HK sudah OK 6. Daya tarik Choco Hour time anak saya suka. 7. Overall Satisfying stay di Movenpick Hotel. 8. Cocok untuk Staycation & acara kantor."

"58.","Cid Kagenou","4","2025-08-01","1","I was a bit disappointed with the service during my stay, especially around lunch and dinner time. The service felt quite slow, and the staff didn’t seem very welcoming, which made me wonder if there might be some internal issues affecting the experience. Because of that, I ended up choosing to have dinner outside the hotel. I hope the management can take this as friendly feedback and consider improving the service quality."

Pas coba kolam renang berasa dapet private pool (kebetulan lagi sepi yg dateng ke tempat renang), airnya aman buat mata krn ngga pake kaporit, ngga bau kaporit, disediakan juga handuk, sabun mandi, shampo, dan conditioner di tempat bilasnya... Request dekor buat kamar, hasilnya diatas ekspektasi, emang crewnya debestt, thanks Kak Septian, Kak Olivia, dan tim dekor 👍👍👍 Tempat buat breakfastnya luas, menunya banyak, nyedianin fnb dari banyak varian (indonesian, japanese, western), dan rasanya enak2, khususnya pasta pesto, sossis daging, es krim, dll"

"67.","Ottis Shelton","201","2025-12-01","1","Went to the restaurant here to enjoy all you can drink beer and all you can eat pizza. Had a great 3 hours. The taste was good and the beer cold. Awesome! Above was my original review and I'm not sure if La Floriane Bistro is owned by the hotel but my wife and I really disappointed by the customer service. Which of course comes into play when something goes wrong. Went to LA Floriane Bistro on the 31st of October for my 27th wedding anniversary with my wife for their Pizza and Beer promo and made reservations 4 weeks in advance which was confirmed. When we arrived using Grab Car we were told promo invalid.. We specified promo at time of reservation. They never contacted us to tell us this information. We ended up ordering car and going home immediately. What a horrible anniversary it ended up to be. Received at WA from them stating they would like to apologize for the mistake on 2nd of November but promo was available on the 7th of November. I guess this was their customer service definition by telling us when the promo was available. I guess they don't understand what customer service is. Maybe they would like to hire me as a customer service trainer? Definitely needs to be worked on."

More than that when we go check in the reception ask me to wait for 15 minutes . Than after 25 Minutes man in the reception ask me to sit properly 🤣 after 45 minutes no one come to finish the check in. Than I go to follow up to the man that told me to sit properly he said the room is already ready since long time ago sorry for not monitoring it. Than after 1 hour my luggage come to room they out it very messy. Even the soap, shampoo, conditioner all empthy. Food cant delivered to room.

"94.","Travel With Jack Chee","161","2025-08-01","5","Newly opened in 2024, this hotel had changed management thrice from Alila Jakarta to Sparks Luxe Jakarta and now Mövenpick, which is part of the Accor group. This 256-room 5-star property is situated along the popular Pecenongan Food Street. To get to the hotel from the airport, I had booked a ride-hailing service (Grab) which costs IDR183,900 (Inclusive of IDR19,500 toll and IDR15,000 airport surcharge), which is about SGD14. I am impressed there are Grab and Gojek staff at the airport to provide assistance to the travellers. The staff even helped me to communicate with the driver on my pickup point at the airport. The journey from the airport to the hotel took about 45mins. In Jakarta, it is rather common to find security staff screening people’s belongings and vehicles before entering the premises of international chain hotels and shopping malls. So, I am glad this practice applies here as well. As a security measure, a keycard is required at the lift for access to the room floors. The rooms at this property start from the 8th to 23rd floor. I had booked the Classic Room and was accommodated in Room No. 1902 on level 19. The room is spacious and measures 30 square metres. It is also wonderful to enjoy a great view of the Jakarata city skyline on this level. The TV is huge for my viewing pleasure. Besides YouTube and Netflix, there are Cable TV channels such as Animal Planet, BBC World, Cartoon Network, CCTV 4, Celestial Movies, Discovery Chanel, HBO HD, KBS World 24, NHK World and Warner TV. There is a USB-C charging port at each side of the bed. The night light on the left side of the bed is helpful for guests heading to the toilet during the night. Although the shower pressure worked fine, the water temperature was a little erratic, which could turn from hot to cold at times. Guests looking for amenities can head to the swimming pool, gymnasium and spa which are all on level 6. There are seven food and beverage establishments in this hotel, namely: * Ginger Flower (Indonesian) - 6am to 10pm * La Floriane Bistro (European) - 7am to 11pm * Song Xiang Lou (Chinese) - 11am to 10pm * Wilde Cut (Steak) - 6am to 10pm * 717 Creamery (Pastry & Dessert) - 10am to 10pm * Supremo (Café) - 6.30am to 10pm * El Doris (Pool Bar) - 10am to 8pm In a nod to Mövenpick's Swiss heritage & famous chocolate, the hotel hosts ‘Chocolate Hour' from 4pm to 5pm daily. Guests can indulge in complimentary chocolate-themed sweets and desserts during their stay here. Mövenpick Hotel Jakarta City Centre is a centrally located property, which offers easy access to the many places of interest such as Monas, Istiqlal Mosque, Our Lady of the Assumption Cathedral Jakarta, Glodok Chinatown and Jakarta Old Town. It is also within walking distance to several convenience stores, dining places and the many food carts lining along the road. Should you require foreign exchange service, there are two outlets, both which are about 15mins by walk from the hotel. If you are planning to escape the traffic jam using public transport, you can take a 11mins (800m) walk to Juanda MRT Station (Red Bogor Line). To avoid the bad traffic, I had walked from the hotel to places like Monas, Istiqlal Mosque and Our Lady of the Assumption Cathedral Jakarta. For a first time traveller to Jakarta, I would recommend a stay here at Mövenpick Hotel Jakarta City Centre as your base to explore the city."

The hotel offers so many great facilities for kids and families, which made everyone happy and comfortable throughout our stay. One of the highlights was the Chocolate Hour, where my child got to try different kinds of chocolate—such a fun and unique experience! And of course, we can’t forget the amazing breakfast at Ginger Flower.

Location is good for reaching all popular places in central Jakarta, but street in front is not a high profile street but just a regular average locality. But the lobby & pickup area is well under hotel premises & upto the mark of star hotel. Mr. SIBURIAN went extra mile to help for great room service, he deserves this fivestar mention for his kindness & help. Mr. Supar was good too. Entrance gate welcoming staff, Front desk, Hotel managers, Restaurant staff, Room service & House keeping.

"135.","Mike Giltrow","3","2025-07-01","1","The hotel is lovely and the staff try their best. However. After 9 months they still advertise an executive lounge that does not exist. They do offer a “quiet” coffee shop to work in and lounge accompaniments in the restaurant. Oh that is of course if there are certain amounts of platinum or exec room guests. As was my stay there was no offering on my first couple days as there weren’t enough “special” guests. I did try and eat but the manager who took my order was far too busy updating her Facebook status and forgot to pass it on to the kitchen. So after 30 minutes I gave up. There is no future planning to open the lounge as they make more using the space for functions. So frequent traveller beware. The Fairmont and Sofitel are much better option if looking for these facilities. I however am sick of Accors lack of concern and after 400 nights in their hotels am looking at Marriot"

"137.","B S","822","2025-08-01","5","Because there were only 2 types of rooms when I stayed, I ordered a classic room, upgraded to the highest room, the deluxe suite. The lounge is not ready yet but there was afternoon tea, chocolate hour, evening cocktail, free breakfast, free late checkout, still got welcome amenities in the room and a free minibar too. The check-in process was smooth without any problems. My daughter really liked the lobby because there were lots of teddy bears. The deluxe suite room has a living room containing a sofa, 2 chairs and a coffee table, a 55 inch TV, a mini bar and a cupboard. The interior has been renovated and gives a modern impression. The coffee table provides welcome amenities, namely a welcome letter, fruit platter and various cakes as well as walnuts and plums. For tea, they use TWG and coffee, they use capsule coffee. The free minibar contains 1 bottle of equil sparkling water and still water, 3 cans of soft drinks (1 coke, 1 coke zero, 1 sprite), and 2 bottles of coffee beer. there is a powder room in the living room, then for the walk-in closet through the living room, there is a luggage rack and cupboard, continuing to the bathroom which has 2 washbasins, closet, shower and bathtub. Complete amenities, lots of towels. For bathtub amenities, there is a separate shower gel, loofah and bathtub. The bedroom is not too spacious because the living room is spacious, there is a carpet. A 55 inch TV and a table and chairs for dressing are available. In the partition between the room and the bathroom, the partition is full glass, there is a roller blind but you can peek and the bathroom cannot be locked. The interior of the room and the lighting are cool, especially if the new Accor hotel is guaranteed to have a fun design. Facilities include a gym, swimming pool, restaurant, and several specialty restaurants. I really like the cool restaurant concept, there is natural lighting but it's cold and there is also a romantic indoor area. For breakfast at 6-10, afternoon tea at 3-5, chocolate hour at 4-5, evening cocktail at 5-7. For afternoon tea and evening cocktail only for platinum members. Chocolate hour for all guests.

The contents of the plate vary between me and my wife. For evening cocktails, they are served with a menu that can be requested as much as you like.

"150.","Egi Al Ghifari","19","2025-07-01","2","This hotel has to be avoided by any Accor Elite member, as your membership deemed useless in term of service. It is new property and seemed operated by newbies. A storm of emails sent by the staff prior to arrival, asking informations as if the whish tou welcome you better. Now I suspect the info is solely for their own benefit, to allow the room prepared just in time, with no upgrade. Surprisingly, bathroom amenities were empty when I arrived, and I got the opportunity to witness the staff refilling the dispenser with cheap refill product from a used mineral water bottle. I'm not sure this even possible in a 5 star Accor Hotel."

Sekitar jam 5 sor3 ketika kami meminta untuk dibersihkan, room service memerlukan waktu lebih dari 2 jam untuk persiapan alat, sehingga akhirnya kami tolak lagi karena sudah terlalu malam & kami sudah ingin istirahat.

The Hotel is still under construction so you will still smell some paint and the hotel did their best using air purifier in all corner of the hallway. The parking is quite tight due to some material being stored in the road access for going up and down limiting the maneuver of the vehicle. The room is clean and nice. Chocolate Hour was great with very good chocolate, ice popsicle, cake - could add selection of drink. The gym provides good selection of equipment with very good quality brand. Breakfast was very good with huge selection of food and not one failed, everything was very nice and high quality - this is the highlight of our stay. Looking forward for our next stay in the hotel."

"267.","Avais Sherani","665","2025-01-01","5","A brand new hotel still operating under the soft launch, highly recommended for a stay in central Jakarta. The hotel is very accessible yet not on a noisy main road, it’s an even 30 minute drive to most frequented parts of the city. The pool and Gym are open for guest use while for accommodation still only 5 floors are operational. As it is a new hotel, everything is latest, high tech, and in best shape. The downside is that there is still some construction work going on which adds to noise and chemical fumes in certain parts of the hotel but those are totally avoidable. Below is a detailed Review: Location: The hotel is centrally located, very accessible. There are plenty of convenience stores across the street. Central locations and monuments around the city are at a walking distance or a short ride. Room: The rooms are really nice and have new furniture as fixtures. Room size is standard and not big. The bed is very comfortable, and there are modern charging slots on both sides of the bed. There is plenty of closet space, while the fixtures including TV and Fridge are of good quality. Bathroom: The bathroom is nice and big with a sliding door for entrance. The shower cabin is also of a decent size and has both the rain shower as well as hand held shower. The amenities were provided in the bathroom as well as the shower cabin. The shower cabin was not fully insulated and the water leaked from it. Facilities: The pool and gym are functioning now. Staff: The staff are the most amazing people, they were the most helpful among all my week long stay across Indonesia. From check in to concierge to room service.

Sempat menginap 1 malam pas masih soft opening, kebetulan baru available kelas classic room. kesan pertama kamar cukup luas, bersih, betul2 masih baru. Staff sangat friendly mulai dari Security, frontline, kitchen, you did it👌. Menu breakfast sangat beragam, western, oriental, indonesia, taste enak, everything is good. Overall saya puas, dan pengin coba category room yang lain."
"293.","Maulinna Utaminingsih","722","2025-01-01","5","Sepertinya hotel ini memang baru, masih bau furniture baru di beberapa ruangan meeting. Hotelnya terlihat mewah, tapi toiletnya g ada tempat tisunya. Tisu ditaruh di tutup flash. Ruangan ballroom terlihat mewah, petugas2nya ramah2 dan helpfull. Rada kaget dengan menu makan siangnya yang tidak banyak pilihan, mungkin rekues untuk budget minimalis dari penyelenggara. Untuk naik ke ruangan meeting bisa pakai lift, tangga ataupun eskalator. Salutnya sudah tidak terlihat menggunakan botol air minum plastik sekali pakai. Jadi lebih ramah lingkungan."

Dan tempat makan dengan inisial GF atau Ginger Flower dan ada juga Wilde Cut. Posisinya dinlantai yang sama dengan Lobby. Tempat duduk sebelum lobby juga lucu. Kita bisa foto2 dengan boneka beruang yang gede2. Pelayanan dan makanan ok. Staff ramah. Suka juga dengan konsep eco friendly yang bisa kita liat di kamar.

The rooms were immaculate and beautifully designed, providing a luxurious and comfortable atmosphere. The staff was incredibly attentive and courteous, always ready to assist with a smile. Thank you for Welcome amenities, their Chocolate Hour in the lobby were top-notch and added to the overall enjoyment of the stay. Anyway, My daugther loves the big teddy in the lobby. one thing that was little bit dissapointed was I had to pay for parking fee even though I had informed and registered my vehicle to the staff However The staff also called me to the room immediately to apology about it. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone seeking a memorable and relaxing stay in the heart of the city."

Saat datang, dan tas masuk X-ray, petugas keamanan bilang Ibu, ini tas nya ada pistolnya ya, padahal dia bisa lihat dimonitor loh, sangat gak enak bgt dituduh seperti itu dan gak ada permintaan maaf. 2. Resepsionis tidak ramah, dan bahasa yang digunakan tdk enak, seolah menyalahkan tamu yg datang. 3. saya sewa meeting room, after break ruangan tidak dicleaning. Pas minta ke petugasnya utk dibersihkan, masnya seolah terpaksa dan grabak grubuk saat merefill minuman. Pintu dibanting saat kita lagi meeting. 4. lunch dan dinner di resto jg tidak langsung direfill, padahal saat itu kami lunch pk 13.00-an dan dinner pk 19.30-an. Dari sisi kamar sih oke, interior bagus, tp overall pelayanan dari petugas yang seperti ini bikin trauma mau nginep disini. Sorry to say aku ga akan nginep disini lagi."

Harusnya WiFi sudah jadi bagian dari fasilitas meeting dong terlepas member atau bukan. Yg paling parah lagi, kami bawa kotakan snack dan kopi dari luar hotel untuk dimakan bareng di ruang meeting, dicharge extra 50rb per kotak, baru kali ini punya pengalaman meeting package di hotel ada yg seperti ini. Definitely will not come back and will not reccomend people here to have meetings."

Security datang bukannya bantuin malah suruh w parkir diluar, dipinggir jalan (kesel banget, bukannya dibantuin malah kayak ngusir w parkir diluar, yang bermasalah mesin parkirnya kenapa w disuruh parkir diluar), akhirnya w parkir diluar, dipinggir jalan sebrang hotel karena w ada meeting pagi biar gak lama dan males berdebat. Pas udah w parkir diluar w tanya reseptionya, terus dibantuin karena petugas parkir tidak stand by di hotel. Pas udah bisa w diminta ambil kartu parkir w dan katanya w masuknya gak perlu di tap di gerbang masuk, jam 11 siang w masukin deh tuh motor w pas mau pulang w tanya lagi, kartu saya sudah bisa kan? Sudah terdaftar kan, pas jam 17.50 w keluar kena charge parking. W tanya reseptionnya by chat katanya karena w keluar lwt gerbang mobil. Kalo dihitung2 w harusnya bayar parkir 7 jam, tapi masa w bayar parkir 3 jam 50 menit dan terdaftarnya kartu w itu mobil. Gimana menurut kalian?"

Tetapi mereka meminta kami membayar air botol, yang menurut mereka akan dipanaskan. Saya tidak mengerti bagaimana pelayanannya bisa seburuk ini, tidak masuk akal dan amatir. Kami adalah anggota Accor, dan ini bukan pertama kalinya saya menginap di hotel bintang 5. Ini adalah pengalaman terburuk."

Di atas adalah ulasan asli saya dan saya tidak yakin apakah La Floriane Bistro dimiliki oleh hotel, tetapi saya dan istri saya sangat kecewa dengan layanan pelanggannya. Tentu saja, hal ini berpengaruh ketika terjadi kesalahan. Saya pergi ke LA Floriane Bistro pada tanggal 31 Oktober untuk merayakan ulang tahun pernikahan ke-27 saya dengan istri saya untuk promo Pizza and Beer mereka dan membuat reservasi 4 minggu sebelumnya yang kemudian dikonfirmasi. Ketika kami tiba menggunakan Grab Car, kami diberi tahu bahwa promo tersebut tidak berlaku. Kami mencantumkan promo pada saat reservasi. Mereka tidak pernah menghubungi kami untuk memberi tahu informasi ini. Akhirnya kami memesan mobil dan langsung pulang. Sungguh hari jadi yang mengerikan. Saya menerima pesan di WA dari mereka yang menyatakan bahwa mereka ingin meminta maaf atas kesalahan tersebut pada tanggal 2 November, tetapi promo tersebut tersedia pada tanggal 7 November. Saya rasa ini adalah definisi layanan pelanggan mereka dengan memberi tahu kami kapan promo tersebut tersedia. Sepertinya mereka tidak mengerti apa itu layanan pelanggan. Mungkin mereka mau mempekerjakan saya sebagai pelatih layanan pelanggan? Memang perlu ditingkatkan."
"411.","Styven Styven","15","2025-09-14","1","Saya menginap sekarang dan pengalaman terburuk saya dengan layanan accorr, tidak ramah sama sekali. Memiliki 2 orang sebagai keamanan dan penjaga pintu ketika kami tiba tidak ada yang mencoba membantu membuka pintu mobil, dan kami membawa semua tas tanpa menawarkan bantuan. Lebih dari itu ketika kami pergi check in resepsionis meminta saya menunggu selama 15 menit. Kemudian setelah 25 menit pria di resepsionis meminta saya untuk duduk dengan benar 🤣 setelah 45 menit tidak ada yang datang untuk menyelesaikan check in. Kemudian saya pergi untuk menindaklanjuti pria yang menyuruh saya duduk dengan benar dia mengatakan kamar sudah siap sejak lama maaf karena tidak memantaunya. Kemudian setelah 1 jam koper saya datang ke kamar mereka keluar sangat berantakan. Bahkan sabun, sampo, kondisioner semuanya kosong. Makanan tidak dapat dikirim ke kamar. OMG sungguh layanan accorr bintang 5 yang sangat mengecewakan."
"412.","Cid Kagenou","5","2025-08-14","1","Saya agak kecewa dengan pelayanan selama menginap, terutama sekitar waktu makan siang dan makan malam. Pelayanan terasa cukup lambat, dan staf tampak kurang ramah, yang membuat saya bertanya-tanya apakah mungkin ada masalah internal yang memengaruhi pengalaman tersebut. Karena itu, saya akhirnya memilih untuk makan malam di luar hotel. Saya harap manajemen dapat menerima ini sebagai masukan yang baik dan mempertimbangkan untuk meningkatkan kualitas pelayanan."
"413.","Mike Giltrow","3","2025-07-14","1","Hotelnya indah dan stafnya berusaha sebaik mungkin. Namun, setelah 9 bulan, mereka masih mengiklankan lounge eksekutif yang sebenarnya tidak ada. Mereka menawarkan kedai kopi tenang untuk bekerja dan minuman di restoran untuk menemani bersantai. Oh, tentu saja, jika ada tamu kamar platinum atau eksekutif dalam jumlah tertentu. Seperti saat saya menginap, tidak ada penawaran di beberapa hari pertama karena tidak cukup banyak tamu istimewa. Saya mencoba makan, tetapi manajer yang menerima pesanan saya terlalu sibuk memperbarui status Facebook-nya dan lupa menyampaikannya ke dapur. Jadi, setelah 30 menit, saya menyerah. Tidak ada rencana untuk membuka lounge lagi karena mereka memanfaatkan ruang tersebut untuk berbagai acara. Jadi, bagi Anda yang sering bepergian, berhati-hatilah. Fairmont dan Sofitel adalah pilihan yang jauh lebih baik jika mencari fasilitas ini. Namun, saya muak dengan kurangnya perhatian Accor dan setelah 400 malam menginap di hotel mereka, saya mempertimbangkan Marriott."
"414.","shakun realty","5","2025-01-14","1","Hotel ini baru, tetapi semua layanan masih belum beroperasi. Tidak disarankan untuk turis. Kami telah memesan 6 kamar untuk perayaan kami, tetapi kolam renangnya tidak berfungsi. Kamar-kamar bermasalah hingga tengah malam karena ada beberapa pekerjaan konstruksi yang sedang berlangsung. Semua kamar memiliki beberapa masalah, AC di satu stopkontak tidak berfungsi, dan kunci di stopkontak lain tidak berfungsi. Secara keseluruhan, hotel ini tidak disarankan untuk turis. Lokasinya juga tidak terlalu bagus, jauh dari mal dan jalan raya. Lokasinya tepat di seberang tempat ibadah. Di gang. Saya pasti bisa menemukan pilihan tempat menginap yang lebih baik."
"415.","Wayne Lim","3","2020-01-14","1","Menginap di Sparks Luxe pada tanggal 4-8 November 2019 merupakan pengalaman yang kurang menyenangkan. Saya telah menjadi tamu tetap hotel ini sejak zaman Alila untuk perjalanan bisnis ke Jakarta dan sekarang telah berganti ke Sparks Luxe yang saya harapkan kualitasnya sama dengan Alila. Silakan lihat komentar saya di bawah ini; Pelayan tidak membantu membawakan bagasi kami di lobi utama saat kedatangan dan keberangkatan. Suhu AC kamar tidak pernah di bawah 24 derajat, bagaimanapun saya menyesuaikannya, hasilnya suhu kamar saya tidak dingin karena panas dari jendela sangat panas dan saya harus menutup 90% tirai untuk mencegah panas langsung masuk ke kamar. Saya check-out pada tanggal 8 November 2019, saya meninggalkan bagasi saya di lounge lantai 7 untuk mengambil beberapa barang sebelum berangkat ke bandara. Ketika saya kembali sekitar pukul 14.30 hingga 14.40, saya meminta sepoci teh dari staf Anda (lupa namanya, tapi dia cukup gemuk) dan dia berkata, Pak, Bapak sudah check out jadi tidak bisa. Jadi, setelah saya check out, saya bukan tamu Bapak lagi dan tidak bisa menyajikan minuman untuk saya? Sikap macam apa ini? Beginilah cara Bapak melatih staf? Mohon tinjau kembali pelatihan staf Bapak. Sebagai informasi, manajemen Alila sebelumnya telah melakukan pekerjaan yang baik dalam melatih staf mereka dan layanan mereka benar-benar Acuan. Saya juga akan menceritakan pengalaman saya selama menginap untuk mengingatkan rekan bisnis dan teman-teman saya yang juga merupakan tamu tetap sejak zaman Alila. Dari: Lim"

Kami tidak kebagian kamar karena sudah penuh, jadi saya harus salat di mushola di lantai 5. Meskipun saya membawa perlengkapan salat sendiri, perlengkapan salat mereka yang berjumlah sekitar 5 set sangat kotor dan sajadahnya juga berantakan. Untuk hotel sebesar ini, hal yang sama terjadi, karena mushola adalah tempat yang penting.... maaf."
"417.","Bali Foodies","23","2018-01-14","1","Kami sangat senang menginap di sini karena kami penggemar berat Alila Uluwatu dan Seminyak. Kami bepergian ke Jakarta selama beberapa hari, dan kami tidak menggunakan mobil mewah. Sayangnya, mobil murah itu tidak mengesankan para pria di lobi hotel. Kami sedang menitipkan barang bawaan, dan sepertinya tidak ada yang mau membantu kami. Terlepas dari kemegahan eksterior dan reputasi hotelnya, kami harus membawa barang bawaan sendiri, sampai kami memanggil seseorang untuk membantu, dan mereka hanya menjawab dengan pertanyaan retoris yang ambigu, Oh, Anda butuh bantuan kami.. dengan wajah bingung. Kami rasa staf hotel seharusnya memperlakukan setiap tamu sesuai standar operasional mereka, agar pengalaman kami tidak terjadi pada orang lain. Apakah kami akan kembali? Tentu saja bukan karena pelayanan stafnya, melainkan karena kamar yang luar biasa dan nyaman, fasilitas, dan lokasinya yang sempurna di jantung kota Jakarta."

"473.","Daniel Jiang","37","2025-12-14","2","Lokasinya bagus, tepat di jantung kawasan kuliner jalanan Jakarta. Hotel ini dibangun pada awal tahun 2000-an dan telah berganti manajemen setidaknya dua kali. Setelah renovasi besar-besaran baru-baru ini, hotel ini tampak baru dari jauh, tetapi banyak detail yang kurang memuaskan. Pertama, pintu kamar terasa tua tanpa sistem penguncian baru. Suatu kali, pintu saya tidak terkunci dengan benar selama berjam-jam setelah staf masuk saat saya tidak ada di sana karena kepala rantai kunci tersangkut di celah pintu. Melihat goresan di sekitar pintu, kemungkinan ini sering terjadi. Ini adalah masalah keamanan utama, terutama karena barang-barang saya hanya ditinggalkan di kamar. Kedua, material lantai kamar mandi sangat licin saat basah. Solusi yang diberikan adalah alas mandi karet tambahan yang terasa tidak nyaman untuk diinjak dan sangat kotor dengan semua kotoran yang menempel di bawah alas, yang saya yakini tidak pernah dibersihkan. Alas serupa juga digunakan di bak mandi yang membuatnya sangat tidak higienis. Setidaknya Anda dapat menggunakan strip shower 3M transparan yang tepat untuk menambah daya cengkeram tanpa mengorbankan kebersihan dan estetika. Perlengkapan mandi cukup diragukan karena tidak ada merek untuk botol-botol berukuran besar. Sprei memiliki noda yang mencurigakan dan tidak ada pilihan bantal. Kamar itu sendiri sebagian besar layak. Hanya saja mengecewakan bahwa smart TV tidak memiliki konektivitas tambahan untuk produk Apple. Koridor lantai kamar terkadang mengeluarkan aroma parfum yang terlalu menyengat. Meskipun hotel mengiklankan lounge eksekutif, tidak ada di properti tersebut dan entah bagaimana tidak akan ada. Tamu suite dan Anggota Platinum hanya akan diberikan layanan makan seperti teh sore dan jam koktail di area restoran. Tidak ada lounge yang dapat dikunjungi tamu kapan saja selama masa inap mereka. Sekarang tentang layanan. Meskipun proses check-in lancar, setelah itu semuanya menjadi kacau. Saya meminta untuk mengambil cucian suatu malam, tidak ada yang datang selama lebih dari 30 menit. Baru setelah saya menelepon kembali, staf akhirnya mengambilnya. Saat sarapan, memesan menu a la carte membutuhkan waktu tunggu yang sangat lama. Suatu kali, pesanan sate saya tidak datang setelah lebih dari 30 menit, saya cukup terburu-buru jadi saya memutuskan untuk pergi. Jumlah staf yang lengkap jarang terlihat di resepsionis; berkali-kali saya hanya melihat satu atau dua staf yang melayani banyak tamu, yang mengakibatkan orang-orang mengantre terlalu lama. Hampir tidak ada satu pun staf yang saya lihat melayani meja anggota Accor. Sebagai anggota Platinum, check-out terlambat pukul 14.00 tidak tersedia, meskipun saya diberi check-in lebih awal pukul 11.00 beberapa hari sebelumnya. Meskipun hotel ini memiliki potensi, tampaknya banyak hal yang diabaikan dalam hal menjadikannya properti yang layak untuk menginap santai. Perlu diingat bahwa hotel ini telah beroperasi lebih dari satu tahun, jadi seharusnya ada banyak masukan yang berpotensi membawa perbaikan pada layanan mereka, tetapi entah bagaimana itulah kenyataannya. Untuk perjalanan bisnis, ini mungkin hotel yang cukup baik untuk dipilih, tetapi untuk liburan, terutama untuk menginap, ada banyak hotel yang lebih baik untuk dipilih di Jakarta."
"474.","Egi Al Ghifari","19","2025-07-14","2","Hotel ini harus dihindari oleh semua anggota Accor Elite, karena keanggotaan Anda dianggap tidak berguna dalam hal layanan. Hotel ini merupakan properti baru dan tampaknya dioperasikan oleh pendatang baru. Stafnya banyak sekali mengirim email sebelum kedatangan, menanyakan informasi seolah-olah mereka ingin Anda disambut dengan lebih baik. Sekarang saya curiga informasi tersebut semata-mata untuk keuntungan mereka sendiri, agar kamar dapat disiapkan tepat waktu, tanpa peningkatan. Anehnya, perlengkapan kamar mandi kosong ketika saya tiba, dan saya berkesempatan menyaksikan staf mengisi ulang dispenser dengan produk isi ulang murah dari botol air mineral bekas. Saya yakin hal ini tidak mungkin dilakukan di Hotel Accor bintang 5."
"475.","Daniel Harding","6","2018-01-14","2","2 bintang hanya karena orang-orang di sana. Mereka semua baik dan penuh perhatian. Hotel di sisi lain tampak tua dan bobrok di beberapa daerah.

Melihat kecoa lain saat sarapan prasmanan juga."
"476.","Ruruh Handayani","1","2017-01-14","2","Tiba pukul 06.30 untuk seminar pukul 08.00 dan masih sangat sepi, Anda tidak akan menemukan satu pun staf di sana pada jam tersebut. Saya juga kesulitan menemukan tempat parkir karena tidak ada orang di sana. Makanannya lumayan dan agak membosankan. Lucunya, saya menemukan hanya ada satu pasta gigi kecil untuk 2 orang di kamar, dan tidak ada perlengkapan mandi pengganti kemarin. Jadi, kami hanya menggunakannya sedikit, atau melewati ritual menyikat gigi di malam hari. 😂"

Fasiltas toilet n kamar mandi dirancang untuk bile kayaknya, ga ada selang air di WC-nya, jadi kalo mau c*bok kurang nyaman., urinoir juga aga merepotkan karena sensor agak2 gimana gitu...menurut saya pribadi mendingan pake keran manual aja..
