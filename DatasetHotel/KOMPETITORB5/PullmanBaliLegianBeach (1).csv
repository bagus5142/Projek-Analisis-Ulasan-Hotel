"1.","Donna Seermon","3","2025-12-25","5","We had a wonderful 3 night stay at Pullman Bali Legian Beach. We were greeted with a welcome drink upon arrival. We were also given a certificate for a complimentary beverage. The property is located right across from the beach, with easy access to restaurants, shops, and attractions. Rooms are spacious, clean, and well-maintained. The hotel has many available amenities, including two pools (one a rooftop infinity pool), a gym, spa, kids program and more. All of the staff were friendly and attentive. I would definitely stay here again and recommend the hotel to anyone traveling to the area. We stayed in a premium deluxe king room with oceanview. We enjoyed our room very much. However, people considering staying here should be aware that there is a busy road that runs in front of the hotel between the hotel and beach. The room's soundproofing isn't the best and the traffic could easily be heard from the room. This could be problematic for some who may be light sleepers."

The food was fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented, with a great mix of local and international options. The atmosphere was relaxed and perfect for starting the day. Special thanks to Seni and Cahya for their warm, friendly service they were attentive, welcoming, and made us feel genuinely cared for. Their positive energy really made the breakfast even more enjoyable. Highly recommended! 🌴☀️"

The rooms are slightly old but understandable as hotel is near the beach. Breakfast spread is great! The hotel Spa packages are on the high side, did not able to book as the day and time we wanted are fully booked. Good stay and will stay again!"

Today's unforgettable experience from the excellent room thank you to the room attendant. And from dinner to breakfast today there are so many choices that we are confused about which one to choose.

From the moment we arrived, the staff made us feel so welcome and well cared for. Everyone was friendly, attentive, and always ready to help with a smile. The breakfast team deserves a special mention — the food was delicious, with so many options, and they went above and beyond every morning to make sure our family was happy. Our room was comfortable and clean, and the resort had such a relaxing atmosphere. The kids absolutely loved the pool and all the little touches that made our stay extra special. Thank you, Pullman Bali team, for making our holiday so memorable — we can’t wait to come back! 🌴💛"
"6.","kuldeep bandal","12","2025-12-25","5","Had a lovely experience at Pullman Bali Legian Beach. The staff were warm, welcoming, and very attentive, making our stay comfortable and enjoyable. A special thanks to Nadya from Accor Vacation Club for clearly and patiently explaining the Accor Vacation Membership. She was friendly, professional, and shared all the information without any pressure, which we truly appreciated. Thank you to the entire team for the great hospitality. Looking forward to visiting again! 🌴✨"
"7.","Sampradha Thapa","9","2025-12-25","5","Overall, I would like to acknowledge the high standards of cleanliness, comfort, and professionalism maintained throughout the property. The facilities were well-organized, and the general atmosphere reflected the quality expected of the Pullman brand. Thank you Ms yanik for wonderful hospitality it was amazing interacting with you hope to see you again in the place making us comfortable"
"8.","Mrinalini Ningthoujam","4","2025-12-25","5","I had such a wonderful experience at the Pullman Bali Hotel. Yanik, one of the staff members, was incredibly kind and always ready to help. She guided us to great places to visit and even assisted us with arranging a cab. Pullman should be very proud to have such a dedicated and helpful staff member like her. Hospitality of the other staff members were also good."
"9.","Ai Siti","6","2025-12-11","5","My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at Pullman Bali Legian Beach. We took a room overlooking the ocean. Upon arrival, we were greeted by one of the hotel staffs with two welcome drinks. Then, we were assisted with check-in by a front office staff named Jesica. She was very helpful and friendly. In fact, all the hotel staffs were friendly and helpful. We had what we needed responded very well. The hotel itself is well located, right in front of Legian Beach, just a few steps away from the beach. There are also many shops and restaurants nearby. Furthermore, the hotel offers a photo session service with very good results by SkySeaSand Holiday Photography."
"10.","Brett McMurchy","3","2025-12-18","5","We stayed here for 6 nights and honesty I can't fault it....Service was amazing. The rooms are large, well serviced and air conditioned. Good selection of food, no Bali belly, complementary water bottles everyday. Booked excursions via discova who have a office in the lobby."
"11.","Leilani Gani","8","2025-12-25","5","Great service from all the staff. My daughter is having fever during our stay and the staff are showing their kindness by sending the meds package directly to our room. Special thanks to Montego restaurant staff (Ratna and Dina and others whom I cant remember the name), going above and beyond, sending fruits to our rooms, heat our meals, and many more. Thank you!"
"12.","Lyn Scantlebury","14","2025-10-01","5","A welcoming experience from entering the reception to walking past staff in the hotel grounds. Nice pool area, especially the adult only infinity pool, which does allow young adults from 12 years of age. Good breakfast, and great location. The best attribute is the staff. Friendly, professional and eager to please. Rooms comfortable and clean. Had read some criticism of beds and pillows, not the case for us. Very comfortable. I highly recommend this hotel."
"13.","Jodie Findlay","10","2025-11-01","5","Mertawan was our amazing waiter- he was friendly, polite and professional. The food was incredible and the service was fantastic! We loved the traditional music and dances. That was a highlight. Another highlight was our ever-smiling and wonderful housekeeping team- Yasmika, Ardiana, Anom and Arnawa. Nothing was too much trouble for the team and they always left our room in pristine condition! Perfect! They’re an asset to the Pullman."
"14.","Tily K","18","2025-11-01","5","Fantastic hotel. Fantastic staff. Beautiful gardens Every single staff member acknowledges you with such happiness! The rooms are lovely and the restaurant food is awesome. One staff member that stood out was a food and beverage attendant called Angie Sujaya! The friendliest and most helpful lady with a beautiful heart. She made our dining experience very joyful! Highly recommend staying at the Pullman Hotel."
"15.","Tariq Alhammadi","265","2025-11-01","5","We really enjoyed our stay at Pullman Legian Beach Bali! The location is perfect — right across from the beach and close to so many great cafés, shops, and restaurants. The atmosphere feels both relaxing and upscale, with a nice mix of modern comfort and Balinese charm. Our room was clean, spacious, and comfortable, with a beautiful view. The staff were always friendly and helpful, making us feel very welcome from check-in to check-out. The breakfast buffet had a great variety of options, and both pools (especially the rooftop infinity pool) were amazing spots to unwind and watch the sunset. Overall, it was such a nice place to stay — perfect for couples or families looking to enjoy Bali in comfort and style. Would definitely stay here again"
"16.","Javid ahmadi","3","2025-12-18","5","The staff are super kind. The treated my family like we were royal and we ment something in life. Thank you pullman staff. The gardens are amazing and the best pools we could encounter. The pullman staff are kind and helpful. The nice foods at the buffet are amazing. The help and try to fix problems thank you pullman for my amazing stay."
"17.","Lance Hollitt","18","2025-11-01","4","We stayed for a week and enjoyed the hotel for the most part. My only issues were that the buffet breakfast is extremely expensive compared to other hotels at double, and in some cases triple, the price and I just can’t see the value. Compared to other hotels the selection was poor and the quality was less than I would expect for the price although still good. The cost for the buffet is 300k each. I had buffet lunch as well which was priced less than the breakfast at 200k plus tax which takes it to just under 250k. The selections were even less than breakfast and the only drink offered was water. When I was dining there was a conference on and they cleaned everything out as well. I was given a discount due to this but only after discussing it several times. I would have thought that the staff know there is a conference so they should prepare more food, this was also during a quiet period for travellers so the number of guests wasn’t high. This is a first world problem but the TV can’t get Netflix or other streaming services. You can access YouTube and local channels but you would expect a 5 Star hotel that is at the higher end of the price bracket to have access to streaming services. The positives are that the staff are great, the facilities are good, the rooftop pool is great in the evening to watch the sunset with a drink and listen to the music being played. They had a saxophone player one night who was fantastic. I would stay there again to see if I have a 5 star experience instead of a 4 star experience but it might be a while because I have a few other hotels I want to try first."
"18.","Victoria Nicole","7","2025-11-01","5","We stayed at Pullman from 6 to 15 October and had a lovely experience overall. We really enjoyed the breakfast buffet there was a wide variety of food choices, and the kitchen staff constantly refilled the dishes so nothing ever ran out. The location is fantastic, being right in front of the beach. The security team was always attentive, even stopping traffic so guests could cross safely. The only downside is that traffic along the Kuta–Legian stretch can get quite busy, especially during peak hours, but it’s a small trade-off for such a prime beachfront spot. In terms of security, we felt very safe throughout our stay. The staff were trustworthy, we even left valuables in the room, and everything was exactly as we left it. There were always security personnel and staff visible around the hotel grounds, and assistance was readily available when needed. The hotel grounds are spacious and beautifully maintained, with plenty of areas to lounge in the garden and several activities to keep younger guests entertained. As for the room, housekeeping was done once daily. Because of our schedule, the timing sometimes didn’t align and we had to call for cleaning, but this wasn’t an issue for us. The team was friendly and responsive each time. The only minor inconvenience was that directions to the infinity pool weren’t clearly provided at check-in, so we only found out about it later in our stay. Aside from that, we truly enjoyed our time here, the hospitality, comfort, and location made it a wonderful experience. We would definitely stay again!"
"19.","dhruv jaggi","11","2025-11-01","2","I recently stayed at Pullman Bali and would rate my overall experience around 2.5 out of 5. The staff were genuinely wonderful — polite, attentive, and always eager to help. I’d especially like to mention Mr. Dodi, who was professional and courteous during our interactions, and Mr. Frans, who responded promptly when there was an issue with our room. At breakfast, Haity and Dep were both outstanding — always warm, cheerful, and very attentive. Their friendly service made mornings a pleasure. However, the rooms felt quite dated and in need of refurbishment. We also experienced a strong odour in our initial room, which required a change. While the team handled it efficiently, it was disappointing for a property of Pullman’s standard. While the hospitality was excellent, the service, facilities and room quality did not meet the same level expected from a Pullman-branded hotel. With some refurbishment and better service & maintenance, this hotel has the potential to offer a much better experience."
"20.","Atif Moulvi","24","2025-12-11","5","This Hotel has become one of our favourite and preferred for a Bali holiday. The location, facilities and ambience is amazing. Service from each and every staff member is outstanding with utmost respect and honesty, especially from the Rio Moka at the Montage Restaurant and Rafael. Both were very helpful and knowledgeable. I would recommend this place to families."
"21.","Leonie Clark","19","2025-12-01","5","Rooms are clean and spacious. Clean your rooms twice a day . Ocean viws are beautiful. Watch the sunset and see fireworks every night. Great service in the restaurant. Especially Margariets pancakes. Walking distance to shops and restaurants. Would highly recommend this hotel and will come back again"
"22.","lee sutherland","9","2025-12-11","4","Super friendly staff. Its a tiny bit tired but they've done a lot of work and it's well worth the stay. Restaurant menu is more suitable for Asian guests. Breakfast is awesome though. Pools are clean and not cold. Everything that we needed and more. And the spa was stunning."
"23.","Nasri Hassan","4","2025-11-01","5","Our stay at the Pullman Hotel was outstanding! The rooms were clean, spacious, and very comfortable. The breakfast had a wide variety of delicious options, and the staff were extremely attentive and helpful throughout our stay. We had to swap rooms a couple of times due to some noise and a slight smell, but the staff handled it quickly and efficiently. They even upgraded us to a double duplex bedroom, which was a wonderful surprise. A special thanks to Rafael Basli, who helped us with every request with great understanding and professionalism. Also thank you sujaya angi. We truly appreciated the excellent service — it made our stay memorable."
"24.","LM Wan","7","2025-12-01","5","I highly recommend Pullman Bali Legian Beach hotel. The staff are very friendly and courteous. Service is outstanding. In particular I am impressed and touched by the front desk staff, Frans; and Seni from the restaurant Montage. Both went out of the way to make us feel welcome, with sincere heartfelt warmth. Keep it up."
"25.","Scotty PERALTA","12","2025-12-04","5","An absolutely exceptional stay at the Pullman Legian Beach! Traveling solo, I was welcomed with genuine kindness. Aurora is a very good girl, she have made my check-in smooth and pleasant, and Frans was wonderful during check-out, friendly and attentive until the very last moment. And surprise he speak very good french 🇫🇷! But I especially want too highlight Arya from the Guest Experience team, who truly made my stay unforgettable. Arya has a beautiful smile, always present, and takes the time every day to sincerely ask how I am doing. Their kindness and warmth feel completely natural. This type of personalized, heartist service is what truly a hotel apart. Because of Arya, I felt cared for, supported, and genuinely valued throughout my stay. The Pullman Legian Beach is a beautiful hotel in a great location, with they perfects pools that offers the ideal place to relax and enjoy the atmosphere. But it is people like Arya, Aurora, Frans and all team who make the experience truly memorable. I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel!"
"26.","Samantha Dalla Santa","20","2025-12-01","4","Loved the location, easy walk in either direction to Kuta or Seminyak. Happy with the size of the room and bathroom. Highlight was the adults pool 🙌 and the Spa 🥰 Only negative was the limited options for english speaking programs that were on repeat and I would not recommend room service. Look forward to booking the Pullman again, loved it!"
"27.","Wanderthirst Holidays","5","2025-10-01","5","We had a truly wonderful experience at Pullman Bali Legian Beach. The property is located right across from the beach, with easy access to restaurants, shops, and attractions. Rooms are spacious, clean, and well-maintained, and the facilities – especially the rooftop infinity pool with stunning ocean views – are outstanding. A special mention and heartfelt thanks to Ms. Vidya, Ms. Eva, Ms. Adele, and the rest of the Pullman team, who went above and beyond in assisting us with our group of 67 guests. From the very beginning – handling bookings, contracts, replying promptly to emails – to the smooth check-in process and constant support during our stay, their professionalism and warmth really stood out. The hospitality here is remarkable, and our entire group felt well taken care of throughout. I highly recommend Pullman Bali Legian Beach not just for individual travelers, but also for groups looking for a seamless and memorable Bali experience."
"28.","Martin Bruckner","58","2025-11-01","5","We really liked our stay at Pullman Bali Legian Beach. The Service is excellent, the breakfast is rich of variety and everything tastes great. The Staff is doing an exceptional service so we could relax and felt welcoming. Especially Sujaya and Anggi I want to point out as super friendly and helpful. Additional I want to point out how much of an effort the staff is putting into recognizing the Accor ALL Status and providing the benefits of the membership. We will for sure come again."
"29.","Hazreen Nursuraya Hashim","4","2025-10-01","5","The hotel is in the good location. Everything is in walking distance for shopping, money changers, night life and food. Room is spacious and comfortable. Laundry is good, they pick up the bag without i called and notify me the stain left on my shirt on the card inserted to my room when i was not there the whole day. Breakfast is great. The breakfast staffs service and hospitality are outstanding especially Cahya, Gita, Viona and Seni. Always greet me with genuine smile and very warm and welcoming. I love the hotel ambience. Great place to stay. Keep it up! Thank you."
"30.","anthony wade-cooper","4","2025-11-01","5","This hotel is like our second home, it’s always wonderful to comeback here and be treated so well. The restaurant staff at breakfast are always friendly and obliging. Their attention to our request are outstanding. Over the past few visits we have found that the service has continued to reach higher standards and runs extremely smoothly even during very busy periods. There are many staff behind the scenes that I have not met, but a special thank you to them. There are a lot I have got to know over the last several years. So thank you Perak, Mariasa,Nova, Elmanik, Arya Saguna, Suli, Ayu Eka, Haity, Heni, Cahya, Yudi, Arsana, Sari, Listia, MangAyu, Anggi, Viola Gita . And from bar team Dwipa, Wayan Adi , The guest experience staff Arya, Lestari, Dodi & Astiti have always strived to make each stay more pleasurable than the previous. The general manager Ravi has his team working extremely well. As the standard of the everything has noticeable improved."
"31.","regina yang","15","2025-12-01","5","From the moment we arrived, everything was beautifully arranged and thoughtfully prepared. The staff were genuinely kind and attentive, they even surprised us with two cakes, one as a warm welcome and another to celebrate my husband’s birthday. A special thank you to Bli Bobby who assisted us during the registration process, Bli Arya from Guest Experience for the warm welcome, and to Ravi & team for preparing the lovely cake that made our celebration night even more special. Even though I had mentioned there was no need to prepare anything, you all went above and beyond. The housekeeping team was also very considerate, providing extra water for us as we had just recovered from being unwell. Such a simple gesture, yet it meant so much to us. The room was spacious and comfortable, with bathroom amenities perfectly set. We’re truly glad we chose Pullman Bali Legian. it felt like a home away from home."
"32.","TheAuthority","85","2025-11-01","5","We stayed at Pullman resort Legian for 7 days in September 2025. I'm very happy we picked this resort. It's a beautifully designed and a majestic resort, its opposite the beach and within an easy 2 minute walk to heaps of shops. The resorts dinning facilities are excellent. We had breakfast there every morning and tea for a few nights. The food was always fresh and tasty. They also have food theme nights which are great. Our room overlooked the beach, it was comfortable, clean and well maintained. There are two pools, a spa and a gym, the outdoor area's are really well presented. The big thing about Pullmans resort Legian was the awesome staff. They were professional, helpful and friendly, it made our stay even better."
"33.","Benjamin Cooper","16","2025-12-01","5","Amazing value for the quality. The staff especially the head of guest relations are top notch. They will cater to your needs and will do so with a smile. The buffet is of good quality and has varied themes each night. The only issue is the location, Legian. As soon as you step out you get constantly harassed by opportunist sellers of all sorts of stuff. But if you find a good deal you should book"
"34.","Iwan F Kartaatmaja","3","2025-12-01","5","Had a very pleasant stay at Pullman Legian Bali. The breakfast spread was excellent with variett of fresh options to start the day right. The staff were consistently warm and attentive. Special thanks to Haity, who surprised us with complimentary drinks and made the experience even better. A comfortable hotel with genuinely good hospitality."
"35.","Robert Schmitz","2","2025-12-01","5","All around great. The Ocean facing room made the exceptional. Access to the beach is thumps up. The food is very, very good. Morning buffets are often dull, but Pullman at Legien Bali stands out! The service is nice. and Terima Kasih"
"36.","Wachid Muslimin","61","2025-12-01","5","I enjoyed my three-night stay at this hotel. The room was spacious and modern. I only had two minor issues: the conditioner bottle wasn't functioning properly, and I couldn't connect the TV to my mobile device. The service was excellent overall. The only small inconvenience was not being able to find boxes to pack leftovers from the ballroom on our gala dinner. My favourite aspect is the location- the beach was just across the road, and it's close to Beachwalk Mall."
"37.","kho Melani","15","2025-12-01","5","perfect sih. breakfast nya enak2 dgn menu yg banyak. so many. they have indian cuisine n its very delicious... 👍👍👍. thanks for ms ratna, you give me delicious cracker with cheese inside. its very yummy"
"38.","Rofa Zinad","1","2025-10-01","4","My stay at Walk Beach Kuta was comfortable and enjoyable. I especially appreciated the breakfast buffet – it offered a great variety of fresh and tasty options to suit different preferences. A special thanks goes to Seni, who was always kind, professional, and welcoming. Her warm smile and attentive service made my experience even better. I would definitely recommend this hotel for its great location and excellent service."
"39.","써니(SSEAN)","2","2025-11-01","5","​We are currently enjoying our meal at Pullman Bali Legian Beach, and I wanted to specifically highlight the incredible service we received from CAHIYA SENI in the breakfast restaurant. She is absolutely wonderful—always greeted us with a warm smile and was so friendly and attentive. She was very quick with our coffee and beverage orders. It's service like this that makes a real difference. Thank you, CAHIYA SENI, for making our mornings great! Highly recommend!"
"40.","A Wilson","3","2025-12-01","5","I was so very pleased with the stay at Pullman Bali Legian Beach that I extended it. I was impressed with the accomodations, service, and professionalsim of the staff. Also, it is within walking distance to the Beachwalk Mall, convenience stores, restaurants, and right acroos from the amazing Kuta Beach. I would recommend that you also get the wonderful breakfast when you booking your stay. Shout out to Rafael from Accor Vacation Club! 👏💯👌👍😊"
"41.","Lynn Blyth","8","2025-11-01","4","Check out with Arya was a joy. All staff very attentive. Room was fine, however I am used to 2 doubles for twin share instead of 2 Singles & wardrobe in bathroom felt odd. Breakfast could do with extending for another 1/2 hour, not all tourists want to get up early & the pool closing at 8.00pm was a little inconvenient if you would like a dip after dinner. Overall a very pleasant experience just some minor adjustments INHO that would make it absolutely great."
"42.","Bagas Dz.","4","2025-11-01","5","Facilities are very diverse and very unique in my opinion, I really like the middle park because every night they have a Cartoon Network show playing, and the spot to watch it are very comfortable too. Rooms are clean and very quiet for testing after a long day in Bali. Foods are Delicious no debate. Staff we're very helpful especially Mertawan and Depa during breakfast, he is always friendly towards my friends and I. Overall great experience, would recommend you to come here or come again if you really looking for a great stay."
"43.","Sarah Marshall","21","2025-10-01","5","This hotel is stunning. Staff are attentive, friendly and professional. Rooms cleaned daily, facilities are very impressive. Food amazing!! The location is perfect for beach , shopping and spas. Only issue we had was the shower in bathroom flooded with every shower that was the only frustrating. Other than that loved our stay here."
"44.","Mutiara Nasution","5","2025-12-01","4","My stay at Pullman Legian was absolutely lovely! The check-in process was seamless, and the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. The facilities were top-notch and comfortable, and the location was perfect - right near the beach and Kuta's vibrant center. Would definitely recommend! 😊"
"45.","Nilesh Javali","11","2025-11-01","4","Overall, our stay was enjoyable. We loved the property and its proximity to the beach, which made the experience even more memorable. The food spread, especially during regular breakfast hours, was excellent and offered a great variety. However, there were a few areas that could be improved: Room Ambience: While the wooden flooring added a nice aesthetic touch, the wooden wardrobes emitted a strong odor that made the entire room smell unpleasant and feel less inviting. Packed Breakfast: The early morning packed Indian breakfast provided at 6:30 AM was disappointing. It included dry rice, poha, and fried pakodas—items that are not typically suitable for breakfast. The quality and selection could be improved to better suit early morning travelers. We appreciate the hospitality and hope these suggestions help enhance the experience for future guests."
"46.","Aaron C","3","2025-12-01","5","We have just completed a short stay at the Legian Pullman and what a fantastic experience. Two staff really impressed us, Cahya and Sentanu, they were very willing to help and provided us with some local insight into our booked tours. The food is sensational, fresh and well presented. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience."
"47.","Aravind Myd","8","2025-11-01","5","Everything here was just perfect - the property, the service, and the pools were all top-notch! The whole place has such a relaxing vibe, and the staff made sure we had everything we needed. Big shoutout to Frans and Agik, the managers who truly went the extra mile for us. They were super kind, always checking in, and made us feel completely at home. You don’t often meet people who care this much - really appreciated it!"
"48.","La Toya Warren","1","2025-11-01","5","Great Location. Ordered the breakfast buffet for the mornings we stayed. Eka Sujani Seni Cipta and Kori (our waitresses each morning) were very friendly and helpful each day. Highly recommend. Location was quite central and it was easy to walk around and to places. It has been easy to get Gojek from the location."
"49.","malama niupalavu","7","2025-10-01","5","I had a wonderful stay at this Pullman Bali Legian Beach from 12/09/2025 - 16/09/2025 The staff were very welcoming and always ready to help with anything I needed. The rooms were clean, spacious, and comfortable, with all the amenities I could ask for. The location was perfect—close to everything but still quiet and relaxing. Breakfast had a great variety and was fresh every day. Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience, and I would definitely stay here again. Highly recommend!"
"50.","Manaor BTC","4","2025-11-01","5","This stay was truly beyond our expectations! My wife and I are so happy with the beautiful room, the lovely swimming pool, and the amazing breakfast. A special thank you to Mrs. Haity — you really made our day with the Buah Naga juice and your wonderful hospitality. It means so much to us. Cheers! 🌸"
"51.","Lucas Janett","1","2025-11-01","5","Very good hotel facilities. Spacious room and very clean. The food at buffet dinner was really nice. The front desk staff was very good and professional. Special mentioned to Indra. He was very helpful and attentive as concierge. Really 5stars hospitality. We definitely will comeback."
"52.","L J M","30","2025-11-01","5","Enjoying our stay. Kids are happy with the pool. Food is great, staff are very nice. Head Chef is such a genuine kind man. Garden view room is quiet and a decent size for our family. Location is good for us."
"53.","Ferhana Gaffoor","6","2025-08-01","4","A Comfortable Stay with Excellent Service, but Room Size Was a Downside We recently stayed at the Pullman and overall had a pleasant experience. However, the room was quite small for three people and felt cramped due to too much furniture. We requested a larger room, but unfortunately, the hotel was fully booked. Despite saying they would get back to us with an update, no one ever followed up, which was disappointing. That said, the service was excellent in all other areas. The breakfast was lovely, with fresh juices made to order and a good variety of coffees and teas. A special mention goes to Ayu, who greeted us each morning with a warm smile and genuine care. The staff at the gate were always friendly and helpful, and housekeeping was quick, efficient, and kept everything spotless. The hotel was very clean overall, and the amazing fragrance in the lift added a refreshing touch. The location is excellent, but the front desk staff need to improve their communication and attentiveness, especially compared to the rest of the team who were truly outstanding. Overall, a great stay with exceptional service just be mindful of room size if you’re traveling as a group, and follow up firmly if you need anything from the front desk."
"54.","Brittney McInnes","1","2025-11-01","5","The Pullman has fantastic rooms, great amenities (security, taxi services/airport transfer, gym, gym classes, day spa, rooftop pool, kids pool, kids club, bars, daily live entertainment - traditional dance, live band/singer, giant lawn projector screen and snack cart) and beachfront location! Plus more I haven’t mentioned. And even better staff! I would stay at the Pullman again based purely on their friendly, approachable, professional staff! Daily breakfast and dinner buffet is around $35aud per person and well worth the money, from every type of food you can think of and the dinner theme changes each night. A special mention to LISTIA, DEPA, and DIPA 🫶🏻who worked in the food section and would go above and beyond for you. Nothing is too much for them, they would check in with you daily to make sure you are having an enjoyable time. They made our stay enjoyable and we already want to go back! They have a wealth of knowledge on the local tourism areas and can teach you about their culture. You will feel safe at the Pullman Bali! Our room was ground floor poolside, quiet room, perfect distance to the pool bar, lounge chairs, buffet and elevator to the rooftop bar (I even did a yoga class on the rooftop and the instructor is kind and professional). Everything in this room is huge, from the bed, bath, bathroom and couch. Every day the room is refreshed so you come home to a clean room. Plus there is 24/7 room service which arrives promptly. You can even choose your preferred pillow type. If you are coming to Bali for the first time and want to be taken care of and feel safe then the Pullman Bali is the place for you. GREAT LOCATION, ALL YOU COULD NEED, & EVEN GREATER STAFF"

Fantastic service and the room service food was excellent. The pool attendants were lovely, they happily moved an umbrella for us when we asked. They were attentive and friendly. We enjoyed the resort rooftop pool and the location made for a quick walk to lunch and dinner options."

Special mention to Sari, Suli, Astiti, Anggi, Eka, Ayu and Perak who have made our stay in Bali memorable. They have worked hard to arrange for a birthday suprise coupled with a birthday song and delicious carrot cake. Their welcoming and friendly demeanor have made our stay felt like going back home and celebrate this birthday moment with our own family. Truly exceptional service."

From the moment we arrived, everything was excellent the room, facilities, and overall atmosphere. A special thank you to Ravi, the hotel manager who went above and beyond to help us during our stay! He and his whole team’s assistance made our holiday so much easier and more enjoyable. The service was warm and attentive, and the hotel itself is in a fantastic location, close to the beach and restaurants. Sunday brunch was an absolute highlight! We highly recommend Pullman Bali Legian and look forward to staying here again!"

The food is sumptuous and staff is very coperative especially Haity, Suli and Asfiti. They are cordial and always ready to help out. The rooms are spacious, near beach and a overall wonderful place to stay in Bali."
"66.","Madeline Carr","10","2025-11-01","5","A fantastic place to stay while in Kuta! The staff are all so friendly and helpful, and our room quality we couldn’t fault.

Beautiful rooms could not complain about the rooms at all. Always cleaned when we were at breakfast. The staff are so friendly and always welcoming and accommodating. We would definitely stay here again and location was perfect. Thank you for having us. 🌸🩷🍸"
"71.","DunnHall","9","2025-12-01","3","Great Staff and Grounds, But Major Issues with Damp, Mould, and Maintenance This was our second stay, and unfortunately, we were very disappointed. The staff, grounds, breakfast, and location were excellent—truly 5-star service. However, we encountered significant issues with the rooms and facilities. Both rooms we were assigned had a very strong, persistent damp and mouldy smell, which was only marginally better after being moved. This seriously impacted our comfort. The complimentary Departure Lounge was in poor repair and had an extremely foul smell, a mix of damp and sewage, which was highly unpleasant for pre-flight showering. Additionally, one of us contracted a severe viral infection/chest cough suspected by our doctor to be caused by a dirty A/C unit. The European buffet dinner was also minimal compared to our last visit, with a notable lack of vegetables. While we had planned a group family trip for 2026, the serious room condition, maintenance, and subsequent health issues mean we will now be looking for an alternative hotel. Overall: Excellent staff and service, but maintenance and hygiene standards in the rooms and facilities are unacceptable for a hotel of this calibre."

"73.","satishd79","6","2025-12-01","3","Location of hotel is good, it is close to beach. It is not like a 5 star property. The rooms were old. There was visible gap between bathroom door. The door even after locking from inside can be opened by pushing from outside. No dustbin for tissue paper in commode closet. No head shower. Hand shower pipe is plastic one and not flexible. No shelves for wardrobe. Wardrobe is not closed. Few tiles in commode area were broken. We used the washroom and shower area in VIP lounge area at the time of checking in and it was stinking like public toilets. I shared the feedback with the person deputed in lounge area but he seems uncomfortable and was compassionate after raising the issue. At the time of checkout there was only one perosn available for carrying our luggage (14 bags) of three rooms even after telling the front office. He was too slow and we have to pick up many of our bags by our own. He was little rude when we asked him to come fast. We had our Halloween special dinner on 31st Oct night. The spread was not wide and great. To our surprise there were no indian dishes available and most of the dishes were of Beef and Pork which we dont eat. We would have appreciated if the person taking our bookings shared the menu with us at the time of booking. Atvthe time of booking they informed us that all the tables are reserved and to our surprise half of the restaurant was empty when we reached for dinner. We were completely disappointed and the cost we paid was not at all worth. We also noticed the different behaviour with Indian guests comparing to other nationals during our stay. Though we appriciate that the housekeeping Staff was polite and the front office gave us early check in for 2 rooms at 12.45 pm. Overall it was not a great stay as per our expectations."
"74.","Sambhav Sharma","86","2025-09-01","5","We had a wonderful stay at this hotel! The hospitality was truly outstanding from the moment we arrived. The staff made us feel extremely comfortable and welcomed throughout our visit. One of the highlights was definitely the Indian food – every dish was authentic, flavorful, and beautifully presented. It felt like a perfect blend of homely taste with fine dining quality. A very special mention goes to Depa, who served us in the restaurant. He was warm, attentive, and went above and beyond to make sure we had the best experience. His friendly nature and professionalism really stood out and made our dining even more enjoyable. Overall, an amazing experience – highly recommended for anyone looking for great hospitality and delicious Indian food!"
"75.","A. S.","182","2025-12-01","5","Great location just by the ocean, and nearby to restaurants, coffee shops and clubs. The room was very clean and big enough. The staff are professionals and friendly. My special thanks to Depa who was responsible for the coffee at the breakfast."
"76.","Amelia Agustina","51","2025-11-01","5","Ragam breakfast nya banyak, standar hotel bintang 5. Mbak Cipta dan Mbak Eka helpful banget with sincere hospitality. Makanan dan minuman enak. Lokasi breakfast cukup luas tp crowded karena occupancy tinggi. Tidak sulit menemukan tempat duduk karena guidance dan accompanied by dua Mbak Cantik gesit di atas (di hari yang berbeda). Di hari terakhir kami di-assist oleh Ibu Ayu dan Ibu Seni di resto. Bukan hanya keibuan dan lembut, namun juga cekatan memastikan apa yang kami butuhkan terpenuhi. Para Bapak Sekuriti (maaf sekali Pak, saya lupa nama) juga eksepsional, dibantu nyebrang jalan dan diminta duduk di lobi lalu akan dikasihtau kalo layanan ojol (motor) udah tiba. Ga ngebedain tamu ekspat dan tamu domestik selama 4 hari 3 malam kami di sini."

"78.","Sally Fyfield","2","2025-10-01","5","Stayed at the Pullman with my partner for a week in late September. The buffet breakfast was something to get excited about and the lovely Ayu not only remembered our names and our drink orders, but was friendly and genuine. The rooftop pool was relaxing with music playing and the room was spacious, clean and comfortable. Right on Legian Beach and only 200m away from Garlic Lane for those wanting to shop. Would 100% stay again."
"79.","Niloofar Mohammadbeigi","2","2025-11-01","1","When we arrived, there was no welcome and they didn’t care at all. Unfortunately, despite repeatedly requesting housekeeping, nothing was done until we went in person to find a staff member to get the cleaning done! We didn’t even have a water bottle to drink from, and the staff didn’t care! This is completely unworthy of hotel guests. The pool chairs were very few and unfortunately fully visible from the rooms. The hotel was very expensive, and I found hair in the breakfast food twice! The windows were not double-glazed, and the street noise was extremely disturbing — we couldn’t sleep or rest properly."

"85.","Hey its MA","48","2025-09-01","5","I’m amazed at the breakfast selection. They dont only served Indonesian & western breakfast but also other country’s cuisine such as Indian, Japanese & Chinese. I was welcome by Ibu Haity. She arrange the seat and what we need for my family. I was attended by Chef Wayan who make sure we have the best food for breakfast. He also wander around the resto area once in awhile making sure the flow during breakfast is right & as expected. Ibu Ayu always offer different options for my picky son. Ibu Dipa Seni offer us to Indonesian traditional healthy drink called Jamu. Offering us fresh options to try too. Its very kids friendly hotel. I love it at night where the hotel provide “family movie time” at the park. They provide bean bags for us to lay and enjoy."
"86.","ricnku kumar","3","2025-10-01","5","We recently stayed at Pullman Bali with our family and overall had a wonderful experience. The resort is lively and offers great facilities for both adults and children. The location is also perfect for exploring Seminyak and nearby beach clubs. On arrival, our first room was not as clean and fresh as expected, which was a little disappointing. However, once we raised this with the team, they quickly addressed the issue and moved us to a better room. After that, everything went smoothly and we truly enjoyed our stay. The kids loved the pool and activities, and we appreciated the attentive staff who made sure our needs were met. A big thank you to the team for turning things around and ensuring our family had a comfortable and memorable holiday. Would definitely recommend Pullman Bali and would be happy to return."

"89.","Nikolas","67","2025-08-01","5","Location: great vibe in and out of the hotel. Beach walk shopping center and lot of restaurants and massage/spa centers were just steps away! ocean was just across the road so easy access. We had daily massages either at spas or by the beach :) horse cart was fun to try! Service: great, especially housekeeping. Someone left their phone at reception and we witnessed how hard they tried to get it back to guest who had walked away without it. Room: Ocean view room was worth all costs Watching people surfing was great fun Sunset was amazing Food: we had breakfast included. Variety keeping different ethnicities in mind. Good hygiene. Heavy on Healthy options. We had one of the most fresh and perhaps sweetest dragon fruits there! Water fountain was available. ‘Bites on wheel’ had tastiest chicken tikka wrap. Ice cream stall had yummy ice creams to lure the kids but perhaps best to keep cash for them, otherwise they are way too slow processing card payment. Entertainment: not much but had a big screen outside for kids to watch and run and around too. We enjoyed playing table tennis by the pool."

"105.","Ronak Gandhi","4","2025-12-01","1","I have booked superior suite for 4 persons for 5 nights and your website showed price according to 4 persons. And when we inputs no.of guest 2, it shows price according to 2 persons only. In my case, your site showed price of 4 persons and I had booked room. It is obvious thing that price was inclusion of bed and breakfast. And anywhere 4 persons can't accommodate on one bed. So bed has to be included in your price. So why pullman has forced me to pay extra money for my extra bedding? I have paid money for 4 persons in advance and when I went to check in , they had force me to pay extra for extra bed. So why your site shows price increased when we select 4 person instead of 2 persons ? For what facility they increase their charges ?"

The staff were all so so friendly and helpful, and every morning Ulik (one of the waitresses that work at the restaurant) looked after us so well.

Breakfast one of the best spreads we have come across in a long time and tasty, with plenty of choice. The bed a little on the hard side for us. Shower great with hot water and good pressure. Sadly, the room we had needs urgent attention, old looking and damaged by water condensation. This condensation is something to do with air con temperature being adjusted above a certain range. It's obvious from the damage to the walls people have been adjudging the thermostat above the optimum range."

The smell in the rooms has been mentioned by many others, and it's a real issue. One of the three rooms we had to change rooms, but even the next room still had a smell. The service was great, and they did add a bonus to make our stay more enjoyable, but the reviews on the smell in the rooms has been going on for some time, and if they are not going to do anything about it, you need to know about it before you choose to stay here. It's a moldy, musky wet smell that makes you feel nauseous."

Big shout out to these Dining room staff Ayu,Margaret has,Dedej,Cahyu, Wila Seni and Sari, some of these staff members remembered us form our last to trips. Thank you Ayu for my Mango every morning. Looking forward to our next stay there."
"123.","1Bridge Marketing","4","2025-09-01","5","The hotel itself is nice and clean and service and staff were amazing and very friendly. But I was there organizing a two day corporate event and it was one of the best events planning experiences I’ve ever had. It was relatively small with 45 attendees but the staff at Pullman did a remarkable job setting up and supporting the event. From Audio Visual to F&B to room set up, every detail was perfect. The staff, from Anggita our main contact and organizer and Adi and Edi who were there every day to take care of us, it was flawless. Adi was particularly amazing - professional, eager to help and always with a smile. Many of our attendees also commented how fantastic he was. If your running an event of this size, I highly recommend the Pullman Bali Legian Beach!!"
"124.","Tunahan Yildirim","14","2025-07-01","5","My stay at the Pullman Bali Legian Beach Hotel was truly excellent. From the moment we arrived, the check-in process went smoothly – special thanks to Asoka, who was exceptionally professional and welcoming. The room offered a stunning sea view, which made the experience even more special. Check-out was just as efficient and seamless. The laundry service was also top-notch – quick and reliable. The staff throughout the hotel were consistently friendly, attentive, and helpful. The food was delicious and clearly prepared with care and quality in mind. All in all, a wonderful stay that I can wholeheartedly recommend."
"125.","Chitransh Rahul Saxena","129","2025-11-01","4","The location is perfect, right by the beach and close to great shops and restaurants. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, with modern amenities, and the staff are always warm, friendly, and helpful. The pool and breakfast buffet are highlights, making the whole experience relaxing and enjoyable."

"127.","Senor Leighton","5","2025-09-01","5","Great family trip, recommend the king superior room we stayed in, very spacious. Kids club had very friendly ladies running it, staff all very nice and respectful, they have kids movies at night on the field, breakfast buffet was great- eggs cooked as you like, western section, Indian section, breads and pastries, juices and fruits, deli section. no bacon unless you request. They have squirrels in the gardens sometimes which was cool. Kids pool great."
"128.","Sam Akerman","1","2025-09-01","5","Rio was amazing! Super friendly, attentive and made us feel really welcome in the restaurant. He was especially lovely with our 1 and 4 year old boys, which made the whole dinner so much easier and more enjoyable. Thanks Rio for the great service!"
"129.","Naimah Abdullah","13","2025-11-01","5","This is a beautiful location with amenities that fit any type of traveler. This location is extremely family friendly while allowing the single traveler room to do their own thing as well. The food was excellent, staff was friendly and helpful. Don't forget about the spa!!"
"130.","Binsar Batara","7","2025-08-01","5","Very nice ambience. The staff were very helpful and accommodated my request to upgrade the room. The breakfast was very good, and they offered a variety of welcome drinks for members. The room was also spacious, and some rooms have an ocean view. However, during rush hour, it can get quite noisy on the balcony since it's right across the street. The only downside is that the rain shower has low water pressure."
"131.","Lyn Ballard","7","2025-09-01","5","Pullman hotel is a fabulous beachfront hotel- close to everything! The rooftop pool is great for sunset drinks and music with the saxophone player is not to be missed. The food is excellent and a huge variety. All staff are very friendly but I would especially like to mention Ayu and Purnama who were both so welcoming! Their kindness and service were outstanding & made us feel at home! They are an absolute asset to the Pullman! We will definitely be returning"
"132.","T F","23","2025-08-01","5","We stayed for 4 nights, and the service was absolutely excellent. The room (executive suite) was very comfortable—our child loved it because it was spacious enough for him to run around and play. The breakfast was appropriate and very diverse, catering to all guests’ tastes—Indonesian, Western, and Indian options were available. The staff were very friendly and always ready to help with anything. Our room was always cleaned thoroughly. There was nothing disappointing at all—especially as an A+ Platinum member of the Accor group."
"133.","Muhammad Anas","19","2025-11-01","5","Beautiful stay offered with service excellence from Ibu Seni during our breakfast she offered us heaps of things due to our inflexibility of our baby that we have to keep an eye with. I won’t worry about early morning surf since its just across the road to the breaks and they got shower and towels at the security so everything is perfect!"
"134.","Rahde Aryawangsa","7","2025-11-01","5","Really enjoy the top notch service. Amazing food at the Pullman Montage restaurant. Special shout out to Mbak Ratna, Seni, and Cahya from the Montage for their swift service in accommodating our requests. Overall great experience"

The food delicious and there is so much food. Every day something different and more appealing to the taste buds. The amenities are perfect clean. Everyone is so lovey and welcoming. I would recommend to e Anyone. You would not even have to leave the resort it has everything you need."
"136.","Gamana Shetty","2","2025-09-01","5","I had a wonderful experience at Pullman Hotel, Bali, thanks to the exceptional service provided by Ms. Yanik and Mr. Frans. From the moment I arrived, they went above and beyond to make my stay comfortable and stress-free. Both of them were extremely professional, attentive, and kind, always ready to assist with anything I needed—whether it was guidance, arrangements, or simply ensuring everything was perfect. Their warm hospitality truly made a difference and elevated my overall stay at the hotel. I sincerely appreciate their efforts and highly recommend Pullman Bali for anyone looking for not just a great stay, but also outstanding service."

"140.","D C","14","2025-08-01","4","We enjoyed our stay at the Pullman Legian Beach, which is situated in a great location. Staff were all really lovely. We thankfully didn't have the problem with the musty smell that people talk about, however we did find the rooms noisy and in need of a renovation. Food prices within the hotel were nearly on par with Australian (Perth) prices so we ate out a lot."
"141.","A. R.","19","2025-09-01","5","We spent our summer vacation at this hotel. The hotel has a good location, the room is clean and well maintained. It is located right across from the beach where we can surf. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The breakfast is extensive and varied. We received excellent service from Ms. Seni Cahya. She is very kind and attentive. We recommended this hotel."

"143.","Alyssa Taylor","101","2025-11-01","3","Good points: - Most of the staff here is very friendly, the morning breakfast has lots of choice and the gym has great equipment/amenities. Bad points: - Mould: The mould issues in many of the rooms is a serious health hazard. I can see people have been complaining about this for 1+ year and the replies from management is that they are doing an investigation and will fix it. Yet the problems persist and really affected our stay. Initially I was offered air freshener, but then pushed for a new room. The first one offered still smelled a lot, but third one was fine. - Very late check in: It’s meant to be at 3pm, but we arrived around 6:30pm and the room still wasn’t ready. We then got back at around 7:30pm with the staff having said they were looking for us as the room was ready. We walked with them then to the room, and alas, there was still a worker in there preparing it. - Privacy concern: when we moved into our new room after the mould complaints, I came back from conference to find some treats and a welcome letter on the desk. However, it had the name of another hotel guest on it with info on how he’d booked, thanking him. This is very concerning. I went to the desk to ask if he was meant to be arriving later as I was worried we’d been given another guest’s room. - Pool loungers: these were rarely available. Mainly there are absolutely not enough for all guests, but also, people reserve them with towels from the start of the day. - Hotel age: it’s clear this place needs a full renovation. For a 5 star hotel you really expect a sleek aesthetic. Edges of desks are crumbling, taps are rusty and hard to turn, damp stains in corners… Considering this is one of the more expensive hotels in the area, I was expecting a lot more."
"144.","Berk Ekim Paşmakoğlu","1","2025-08-01","5","Pullman has a peaceful environment in its inner area for both adults and children. The food was quite delicious. The rooms were comfortable. The personele was always smiling and utterly respectful. We enjoyed a lot in the infinite pool. It was so close to the Kuta beach. Everything seemed us to be nearly perfect."
"145.","HALIMA LATRECHE","2","2025-09-01","5","I spent an excellent week at the Pullman: the rooms are extremely pleasant (ocean view or garden) and very well equipped with thoughtful touches. The staff is friendly, helpful, and extremely responsive (I had a noise problem, and they moved me to another room in less than an hour). The restaurant and bar are high-quality, and the food is varied and refined. A special mention goes to Bella, Haity, and Eka, who are always cheerful and welcoming. My family and I will definitely be back!"
"146.","meowie kitten","27","2025-10-01","2","To be honest, this hotel looks and feels more than 20 years old inside the rooms. The wooden floors are scuffed and tiles have turned yellow. I must highlight if you have asthma or other air particle allergies, the air-conditioning will set it off immediately. The filters have not been cleaned for a long time and smell of old sweat in Block 3. Staff are nice and friendly though."
"147.","Lincoln Stewart-Noble","5","2025-12-01","5","Y’all must try the cucumber martini at the roof top bar!! Best drink ever!! Our expectations of service was exceeded!! Especially from a friendly waiter named darmawan Nick edy, edy, trisna. Great fun and location!"

Pelayanan dari staffnya benar benar profesional dan terlatih. Pak Indra di concierge sangat ramah dan sangat profesional. Sangat banyak membantu selama kami menginap. Liburan nanti semoga bisa nginep di sini lagi. See u Pullman Bali 👍"
"153.","Sarah Bishop","7","2025-09-01","3","I’d love to leave a 5 star, the only downside to our experience as a family of 4 is the full grown adults laying on the only lounges around the children’s pool. Despite 2 other pools available to adults. This did not allow our family space to supervise or rest between swims. For a better experience I feel regulating the use of the of the children’s area and limiting to families. The adult pool is huge with a lot of space, We had an issue of an adult moving the sunshade from our children to her lounger so that she can sleep."
"154.","Claude simmons","3","2025-10-01","5","Food was was Food was excellent and the staff it was very very good and especially the young girl call Martini. The location is very good.

"156.","Daniel Lock","1","2025-09-01","4","Stayed with a package through my Bali. The resort itself is feeling a bit tired. The rooms were very musty but functional. We did attempt to upgrade but nothing was available. After we requested some cleaner linen and settled in we were fine. The major downfall for me is that the pools all shut at 8pm so if you’re getting home late from a big day or after dinner no swimming is available. Seems silly🤔 The resort of perfectly placed central location. The staff are amazing. It truely make the experience having wonderful staff. Margarita and Seni at the breakfast buffet were both amazing. The waffles 🤤🤤"

"162.","dayu nawang","12","2025-10-01","3","Perlu ditingkatkan kebersihannya, masuk pertama aroma kamar tercium kayak rumah lama, lembab dan berdebu. Saya stay 3 malam di sini dan setiap masuk kamar tidak berhenti batuk. Selain itu, lemari juga berdebu, table top wastafel bernoda, kran kotor. Saran saya perlu ditingkatkan kebersihan kamarnya. Oya satu lagi makanannya juga perlu ditingkatkan, semoga ke depan lebih bagus lagi🙏"
"163.","Sioned Oldfield","10","2025-11-01","2","Facilities were extremely overcrowded, and the pools were much smaller than expected. The sun beds are positioned directly in view of all the hotel room balconies, so there’s no real sense of privacy when trying to relax. You’re better off spending a little extra and staying next door at the Legian Beach Hotel."
"164.","Emma G","5","2025-10-01","5","Breakfast is amazing. So many choices. Ratna was so helpful and came and made sure we were enjoying our breakfast and that the kids were happy and offered us more hot drinks including Milo Willis we were unaware they had but the kids were so excited to get"

Thank you for such an amazing and wonderful service and hospitality."
"167.","Yayan Sopian","52","2025-08-01","4","1. Harga kamar mahal tp rasanya gak sebanding dengan yang satu level di kelasnya. Sepertinya kita bayar harga kamar hanya untuk luasnya aja sesuai dengan type dan viewnya saja. Toilet flush tidak berfungsi terlalu baik, harus dicek kembali setelah menggunakannya karena air yang terus keluar. Hari pertama toilet tercium bau yang lebih mirip bau kaki. Untungnya hari selanjutnya hilang. 2. Worst mie goreng ever, order in room dining yang datang adalah mie yang keras dan kering. Harga 150K gak worth untuk sekelas bintang 5. Complaint lalu diganti dengan yang baru. Terlihat perbedannya ketika mie yang disajikan dimasak per order, sayuran fresh dan masih hijau. Berbeda dengan orderan sebelumnya yg terlihat kering dan sayuran yang tidak fresh. Terlihat seperti mie goreng yang ada di warteg. Yang dimasak jam 5 pagi lalu msh tersaji di jam 3 sore. Sepertinya lebih mirip sisaan buffet breakfast. Lalu dihangatkan kembali menggunakan microwave. Alasan fnb and chef adalah “mie yang belum termasak sempurna sehingga tekstur nya keras”. Alasan yang harusnya tidak keluar dari seorang chef hotel bintang 5, indomie pinggir jalan saja mereka masih bisa memasak mie yang lembut dan lezat. 3. Semua guest welcomer tidak terasa feel welcome, terlihat takut untuk menyapa. Need more training even it just fake welcome and how u manage to make it like sincerely. FB team much better thanks for take care during our breakfast. Well groomed, and very nice treatment."
"168.","clinton cole","22","2025-08-01","2","5 Star Hotel with a 2 Star pool & 1 Star kids club. When we checked in, they were fully aware there were 4 of us in the room yet only one bed. There was a mix up with our travel agent with the booking however the arrogant Duty Manager (Frans) advised as that we were to pay for extra bedding and to go down the reception to sign for it - there was zero trust given to the the customer even though we were there for 5 days. His position was sign it or we do not get the additional bedding. Apart from that other hotel staff were awesome, great location but for kids not really that accommodating. Please read other reviews as well before booking."
"169.","Luluk L.A","7","2025-09-01","5","Amazing stay at Pullman Legian! The hotel is beautiful, perfectly located near the beach, and has a great rooftop pool.

We had Ayik at reception greet us on arrival and from the beginning she was friendly, professional and extremely helpful in organising us our last minute accommodation. We had a superior suite for our 2 adult 2 children family. Our room was the perfect size, super clean and we absolutely loved our stay at the Pullman."
"175.","Aqsha Karbela Alt","7","2025-09-01","5","I stayed at Pullman Hotel Legian for work, but its Bali so even work feels like a short break. The room was okay, for me it was a bit old theme with wood elements but overall okay. The location was good, many attractions and places around to visit on walking distance but expect a heavy traffic to reach the hotel if you drive a car. The service of their staffs are the one which make this hotel comfortable to stay. Their staffs are very attentive, welcoming, warm and helpful beyond expectation. At concierge, I had Pak Indra helped me. He was very attentive, helpful and very knowledgable in his job. He also a good ambassador of Bali. He knows good places to visit and can advise you on where to go around the island. Good job Pullman Legian for choosing great staffs working for your hotel."

"177.","Werner De Wit","28","2025-08-01","3","Good: Location! Family rooms Some wildlife to animate the kids. Fitness area. Average: Although I read super reviews about the breakfast, most midscale hotels even from the accor group in Bali offer a similar or even better experience. Limited space at the pools (not only an issue at Pullman, that is why I put it under average) Below average or bad: Check in. At the desk at 12h30, it was past 16h before our room was ready. The latest I ever experienced. The matrasses of the beds are among the thougest I experienced within the accor group (midscale and premium). For side sleepers like me this can be painfull. Elevators require badging which is really annoying. I don't understand why. Although positioned as premium the rooms need renovation. Example: there was no wall socket on both sides of the bed. I tried the wall socket close to the bed. It took me a while before I noticed the phone was not charging. I asked reception to send someone. Conclusion: wall sockets don't work, to fix they would need to break open the ceiling (offcourse not the most apealing idea)"

"179.","Neeta Ashra","163","2025-07-01","4","We had a wonderful stay at Pullman Bali! The location is perfect—right on the beach and just a short walk from all the buzz of Kuta, yet the resort itself feels calm and relaxing. The rooms were spacious, clean, and very well maintained, with all the modern amenities we needed. The staff deserves a special mention—so warm, attentive, and always ready to help with a smile. But we felt there’s always delay in room service. Housekeeping staff was always busy and anything asked for would be delivered after an hour. The breakfast buffet had a great spread with something for everyone, from local Indonesian dishes to international options. Though pure vegetarian options were limited. The pool area is beautiful. Highly recommend this resort for couples, families, or anyone looking to enjoy a luxurious and relaxing time in Bali. Would love to come back again!"
"180.","David “Angry” Anderson","250","2025-08-01","4","First time in Bali so nothing to compare it with. Here 10 nights. Room was spacious & quiet. Bathroom facilities were pretty good, although - like everywhere here - you have to avoid getting water in your mouth. Bottled water is provided for cleaning teeth. our shower did not drain properly and there was a pool of water in the base at the end of each shower. The basin was initially the same and we cleaned under the plug ourselves to remove soap scum & hair to relieve that partial blockage."
"181.","E S S A","10","2025-09-01","2","The room was facing the main street, and unfortunately I had difficulty sleeping due to the noise from motorcycles. The window insulation was not sufficient, and I could also hear people passing by in the corridor since the door was not soundproof. I kindly hope the management can consider improving these aspects for future guests. Thank you very much."

Small annoyance, but noteworthy Otherwise the staff and facilities are satisfactory, some areas are in need of a little TLC but overall the hotel is clean, tidy and comfortable We ate at the themed buffet a couple of times, Arabian Night was excellent! Great value trip, will return"

I highly recommend that you find waitresses Sari and Sennicahya they are the sweetest people you will meet here in Bali. They have such great hospitality skills and will make sure you feel right at home every chance you meet them. I’ve been here 3 days and already feel like I belong here. I most definitely be planning another trip here at Pullman hotel"

"194.","Robert Ouko","1","2025-07-01","5","Service in this hotel is top notch, right from the entrance and all the way throughout our stay. We were amazed by the kindness and professionalism the staff exudes here, always smiling and ready to help. Everyone was on top of their game from the front desk, restaurant, housekeeping and pool bar, they made us feel at home and relaxed in entire stay. Can’t forget to mention outstanding staff who had impact on our stay ; Diah displayed utmost care at our check in and was ready to assist whenever we passed by the reception, always checking on us and inquiring how our stay is going on, Nengah the concierge is a master in his work and has a vast knowledge of Bali and what to do, Ms. Lestari was helpful at our check out and promptly assisted with our inquiry. Housekeeping did a commendable job by keeping our room spotless clean and replenishing items on time, thumbs up to Ayik and Citra for the towel art and encouraging piece of note they left on it. Breakfast had variety of options to choose from with sumptuous, fresh meals in all sections and a change of menu daily. Eka and Aditya stood out at the restaurant and one more trainee who served us dinner at the garden pool, I forgot her name, she had the knowledge of menu and her suggestion turned out to be a tasty delicious meal. A big thank you to the restaurant team for the surprise birthday cake and a song in the restaurant. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this beautiful hotel. We highly recommend."

"209.","HG","43","2025-08-01","4","the resort a bit underwhelming. The property is quite old, and the rooms felt dated. While the staff were generally good, the service wasn't what l'd expect from a 5-star resort - for example, the front desk staff weren't very friendly or helpful, and I had to wait over 30 minutes for a porter to collect my luggage. The breakfast was okay but definitely not on the level of a 5-star rating; it felt like it was lacking variety and quality. On a positive note, I met Sari, a kind, friendly young woman who went above and beyond. She truly stood out from the rest of the staff and made my experience better. Although it’s located on a busy street, it’s quiet. The beach is just across the road, and close to all the shopping spots in Kuta."

"212.","Nicole Sharkey","11","2025-07-01","5","Our stay was exceptional! The grounds and the amenities were fantastic. Upon entry on our first day, everyone welcomed us professionally and kindly, and nothing was too much of a problem. The staff were definitely the highlight of the trip. They made things easy and helped us with any questions that we had. Our room was in a great spot. We can highly recommend the beach view balcony rooms, watching the sun go down from our balcony and then finishing with fireworks. What an absolute delight. Housekeeping made sure our room was discreetly, cleaned and tidied every day and to come home at the end of the day for our beds turned down for us was such a beautiful touch Breakfast was amazing with so much to choose from and everyday offered us a different delight to try. We would like to leave a very special mention to Depa, his service at the restaurant on most days certainly made for a great experience. His personal attention and very knowledgeable recommendations of the area certainly made our stay and enjoyable one. He is an absolute asset to Pullman and we look forward to seeing him again on our next trip."

"221.","Coraline92","23","2025-08-01","4","We stayed at Pullman Legian Bali for a week under the Wellness & Spa package (Room 1330), and overall had a fantastic time. The food was excellent, especially the nightly buffet dinners — fresh, varied, and with great entertainment. The hotel facilities were beautiful, the rooms were comfortable, and the gym is honestly one of the best we’ve ever seen in a hotel. We also want to highlight the exceptional service from Suli in the restaurant and Alfito at Reception — both went above and beyond to ensure things ran smoothly and fixed any issues quickly. However, a few things did take away from the experience: • There was a major miscommunication around the spa package. Even though massages were included and we had vouchers, we were charged every time and chased daily by reception and housekeeping over the bill. • The included Trifecta experience was also mishandled, with staff saying we had to give up a massage to redeem it, which was incorrect. • Housekeeping consistently set the room for two guests, even though we were three, and towels were never restocked properly. It felt like children aren’t considered guests, which was disappointing in a family-friendly hotel. • At the Level 1 pool, staff were friendly but not proactive. You really had to go out of your way to order food or drinks. • Lastly, BBQ smoke at dinner needs better fan placement — it either blew into the undercover area or out toward the garden, which made it a bit unpleasant at times. As hospitality professionals with 20+ years working in 5-star hotels, we saw real potential here — it’s a beautiful property with great people. Just a few operational tweaks would elevate the guest experience significantly. Would we come back? Yes — but we hope the communication around packages and room setup improves for next time."

Everyone was incredibly warm and attentive from check-in to check-out. The check in process was very smooth and I got the room upgraded by Ms Aurora in the front desk. Very nice and excellent service by her. What made the experience more special was how the team helped celebrate my mom's and uncle's birthday during breakfast. Without me expecting anything, the staff surprised us with a beautifully arranged cake and a sweet birthday song. It was such a thoughtful gesture that made my morning unforgettable! Special thanks to Cahya, Lina, Ayu, Seni and Dedek for making everything feel personal and heartfelt. The breakfast spread was also amazing—fresh, delicious, and beautifully presented. Specially the beef crispy bacon, my child favourite beside the waffle ice cream that was so yummy. The room was spotless, the service was top-notch, and every single staff member was friendly and welcoming. This hotel truly goes above and beyond. Thank you so much for making our trip so memorable. I’ll definitely be back and will recommend it to friends and family!"

"227.","Sandee Harilela","1","2025-10-01","3","The hotel is in need of sprucing up. I stayed in an ocean view room...it was a decent size but had a very musty/dank smell. The balcony doors had no soundproofing whatsoever so, being right on the main street, it was very noisy at night. Fireworks, traffic, loud motorcycles etc. The weekend was the worst with fireworks going off at 2:30 am. Also, it would be nice to have screen doors so one can enjoy the ocean breeze during the day without fear of bugs in the room, albeit the noise factor. The shower knob to switch to rain shower mode seemed rusty and difficult to work. The location is pretty good as it is close to many restaurants, bars shopping etc."

"235.","Hilik Shivek","5","2025-09-01","4","I will start by saying that the kid's club and its staff were amazing. Our daughter kept nudging us every morning to go to the club. Ayu, Pipit and Ratih were all very kind and supportive of our daughter's needs. Also, breakfast was very good and versatile. I suggest not coming late as at 10:30 sharp, it seemed like all hotel staff was storming into the dining area to collect the food and you have nothing left at 10:32. The room, however, was quite disappointing. We booked two rooms, and tried requesting for them to be interconnected right from the beginning, through hotels.com, whatsapp, and calling the hotel, but we did not get connecting rooms. The room on the 2nd floor of building 2 was just awful with a terrible smell of mold, and the following morning, the odor was topped up by sewage smells from the shower. The hotel staff was attentive enough and moved us the next day to the 4th floor of building 1, we finally got interconnected rooms, and there was no unusual odor. There was a lot of noise from the street, but we could handle that."
"236.","Shuvojoy Chowdhury","83","2025-07-01","5","We had a wonderful stay at Pullman Legian Beach. The rooms are spacious. Ocean views are calming, sunsets can be enjoyed from the balcony. The beach is easily accessible. The breakfast spread is varied and fabulous. Food and drinks at Bite on wheels was a truly serene and relaxing experience. Meals at the restaurant was also superb with large portions reasonably priced. In room dining was efficient too. The location of the property is also superb. Legian beach is across the road. Kuta beach is a 5-7 minute walk. The Beachwalk mall is a 15 min walk. And there are restaurants, pubs, groceries, pharmacies etc everything within walking distance. And above all, the courteousness of the staff made us feel so cared for. Every single staff we interacted with was so welcoming and keen to help us with any little thing we wanted. We wished we could stay for a few more weeks just to relax."

This hotel provides comfort and a variety of activities to do, along with enjoying the pools. 24 hour gym, daily free zumba, yoga, boxing etc classes, outside cinema and of course the spectacular spa facility. We will definitely come back. Highly recommend!!"
"239.","Miikael Tian","13","2025-08-01","4","I would like to express my gratitude to the staffs at the All Day Dining outlet, specially to Cahya & Wati (sorry couldn't really recall I hope I remember the second name correctly). I was just borrowing a place to feed my baby her porridge, and their hospitality is really something I appreciated. They even helped me to entertain my baby when I got to run to the kids club to grab my belongings. However, I do feel the luggage system is something the hotel needs to work on. Our luggage wasn't sent to room till we need to follow-up to get them sent. Overall, it's a pleasant stay with Pullman Legian, breakfast buffet was superb with plenty of choices. Definitely will consider to visit again in the future!"
"240.","Explore With Seb","216","2025-09-01","1","I really dislike giving bad reviews, as I believe everyone can have a bad day, but reading the reviews it seems it’s not just a bad day, but regular occurrence. As a frequent traveller, with 10-15 trips per year, I understand that not every hotel will be perfect, but I’d expect at least a decent experience for the money we spend. FYI that we booked as Gold Members. 1) Room: we booked this hotel after seeing the nice images on the Accor website. On a recent trip to Bali we stayed at Grand Mercure in Seminyak and decided to choose a different hotel this time. Upon arrival we were upgraded to superior suite, but nothing superior about it. Very dated look, with old furniture and a smell of mould. The room is excessively humid unless you turn the aircorn on low temp, which makes the room uncomfortable. Loud noise from the pool, and can hear the room next door speak. Complained about the room but was told that all rooms were upgraded - nah don’t think so. 2) Staff: while the staff outside the lobby is kind and helpful, the check in staff is dismissive and not welcoming. Despite stating that we were gold members, no additional services were offered until we asked about them, including the room upgrade. Clearly highlighting a need to upskill the staff on benefits of different member tiers. When calling the front desk a few times during the stay, no one picked up or we were just redirected to another department which then also didn’t pick up. Housekeeping was also terrible, not properly cleaning the room, leaving the food outside the room for multiple days (not sure for what) and not picking up a juice from our room that was there for a few days and obviously not being used. 3) in room dining: on multiple occasions super delayed. First night, 45 minutes late and came only after complaining. 3rd day morning breakfast took over 50 minutes despite sharing it would be 20-25 minutes and arrived cold after multiple follow ups. Only redeeming quality about this hotel is the photo service that is ‘free’ but be aware it’s 1.5MIO for the digital photo package - but honestly it’s worth it. There are many properties in Bali including the surrounding area of this hotel that are far better for a similar price. Definitely do not recommend and don’t be back."
"241.","Kieren Davidson","40","2025-12-01","5","Great location, friendly staff, good breakfast. Would stay again. Not ideal for families with kids but great for singles and couples."
"242.","mary hewitt","10","2025-08-01","5","WOW! If you want the Royal treatment from the moment you walk into reception to the dining experiences, amazing presentation of food, and the beautiful, clean rooms Then this is the place for you! We’ve just returned after a six night stay at the Pullman Legian and cannot say enough about the 5 star Quality of this hotel. Let me start with the dining experiences at the restaurant that we had During our stay. The buffet breakfast was in itself an excellent start to the day. The staff remembered our names and what sort of tea I enjoyed. The variety was quite exceptional from of course, the bacon and egg stations To Indian Asian options. I even enjoyed some sushi finishing with danishes waffles & ,ice cream. Wait! there’s more!! A granola bar Where you can design your your own Greek yoghurt , honey and muesli bowl sprinkled with fresh fruit & dates. Everything was very fresh and beautifully presented. No food ran out in the buffet. Everything was replenished very quickly. There were many dinner options with various themed nights, including Asian, Indian European, and even surf n turf nights accompanied by traditional Balinese entertainment, or guitarist in vocalists. We also ate à la carte a couple of nights, which to my surprise was Very generous servings and delicious. My mei goreng was the best I’d eaten. The pumpkin soup was in a bowl big enough for 2!! Every day we were greeted with very happy smiles as we walked around the hotel grounds. A big shout out and a hello to the staff at the buffet restaurant Suli Who always fussed over us, Mang ayu, Ratna, Listia, Sastra & Ari the food and beverage organizer who always went above and beyond to make our stay fun and memorable. See you in 6 months Team!! Food aside - our room was very spacious, clean and modern. I’m very fussy when it comes to bathrooms and ours was beautifully tiled and clean and not a sign of mould anywhere. Plenty of toiletry products, replenished every day, including toothpaste, toothbrushes, shaving cream, and shavers. Service was one thing that impressed me with the Pullman if anything needed doing then they would attend to it straight away. We had a slight miscommunication with our room clean, which wasn’t done when we returned After a busy day out and about. After speaking to reception, we were offered complementary drinks in the L bar until our room was cleaned. A few Chocolates were even left in the room as a thank you for any inconvenience. A Special mention to Artika who was our cocktailMaker extraordinaire at the L Bar. Finally, the infinity pool is fantastic for a drink, music and sunset. One after noon There was a trumpeter that accompanied some pretty groovy music next to the pool. Great atmosphere. Very kid friendly as well with table tennis around pool area, children’s pool, a massive screen in grass grounds that they play fun cartoons etc of an evening. If you’re going to stay at Legian , Id definitely look no further than the Pullman that is just across the road from the beach and very central to shopping like garlic Lane and many other spas and shops and cafes That are nearby. The Pullman has it all!"
"243.","Goliath David","2","2025-09-01","1","I am disappointed with the poor product quality at Pullman. Plus I bought an ocean view room but only saw trees blocking the view. Had to make a complaint to get the ocean view. Staff at the front desk got the new room but did not inform us and we had to wait hours gor the new room even though it was ready. The shower is defective. Overall product is very much dated and overdue for a product renovations."

A special appreciation goes to Haity, the F&B Manager, who ensured everything ran smoothly and made us feel so well looked after each morning. Her attentiveness and kindness truly elevated the experience. We also loved the creative and relaxing hotel activities, like the cozy outdoor movie night and picnic-style setups in the garden — charming touches that made our stay feel even more special. Kids club design was a bit outdated but the place is clean and friendly staffs entertaining the kids. Our room was clean, spacious, and very comfortable, and we loved how the hotel is just a short walk from the beach — perfect for sunset strolls or a quick morning dip. Pullman Legian Bali is more than just a place to stay — it’s a place where you feel cared for. We’re incredibly grateful for the experience."
"257.","Sam H","141","2025-06-01","4","We recently stayed for a few nights and had a wonderful experience. The staff and hotel workers truly made our visit enjoyable. There was an unexpected influx of a large group from India (around 60-80 people), which took us by surprise and contributed to a bit of culture shock. It was quite chaotic at breakfast time, even though the staff worked hard to ensure that everyone had a seat. At one point, a gentleman insisted on sitting with my wife, even though she was telling them the seat was taken. Despite that, the service we received was excellent. We even did some laundry, and I was impressed when the team returned the cash I accidentally left in my pocket. The honesty of the staff really amazed me. We will definitely stay here again, primarily because of the wonderful team. I just hope they are appreciated for their hard work!"

"265.","Susie Sacca","4","2025-09-01","1","We had a terrible 7 day stay at the pullman. We arrived as a group of 10 and we had booked through a travel agent. The pullman did not provide the rooms we had booked and even when I showed them the booking paper work which clearly described the room and the number of people per room they took 3 hours to sort out our room. I called the agent and the manager of the hotel refused to speak to the agent. We finally got our room keys after 3 hours and countless phone calls without an apology. The staff at the hotel were not friendly most did not understand english. the pool area was disappointing and dull no music or entertainment and to find a table at breakfast was impossible. My sister asked for 2 extra drinking glasses and they told her they would charge her $10. Very disappointed with our stay. Would not recommend."

We also want to extend our appreciation to Gus Mang, who went above and beyond to ensure we had the best experience possible. The hotel’s location is excellent—just a short walk across the road to the beach. The facilities are top-notch, with ample parking and a wide range of amenities including a well-equipped gym, a beautiful pool, relaxing massage services, and delicious dining options.

Depa and Dipa I know you work different shifts but I really think the hotel needs to let you work as the comedy 🎭 couple, you were always smiling, friendly and proud to be working at the Pullman. We appreciate the little things you did every day and the effort you went to make us all happy. You may put your hair a different way but you’re both an amazing asset to the restaurant at this hotel, I wish you both the very best. Merrawan, much like the hotel manager you were there to make sure our experience was nothing but second best. The noise from the motorbikes around 12-1am and fireworks at ~2am were loud and seem to echo throughout the resort. The loud motorbikes (around 10-12) seemed to be consistent at another hotel and this hotel every night of the week almost as if there were some unhappy locals trying to wake up all of the tourists. This is no fault of the hotel however I hope that the businesses can stop this from happening as it did wake our little one a few nights."

Haity went out of her way to ensure we were looked after and the girls learnt to speak and use common manners in Balinese. She is outstanding!! A real credit to the hotel as her approach and nature is so welcoming. Also have to mention Sagito on the pancake and waffle station.

When I went down to collect my husband from reception when he arrived, then returned to our room, it had a severe sewer smell coming through the air conditioner. We had to turn it off to get rid of it. There is also a large gap under the room door which whistles very loudly like there are gale force winds on the other side of the door. The rooms are lovely and large, but the smells and the Gail wind sounds under the room door will prevent me from returning again."

Best service for private tours and excursion Staff: Ratna , adit, Gita, Sugi, meitha was very helpful and good are delicious. Although some negative review about the main pool is not in the middle of the courtyard, but bit apart and the sun doesn’t reach directly to take a great sunbath . Installation a little be old, the washroom door in the room was broken, didn’t close properly, Plus in the toilet I found one small cockroach. I had to leave a message to the cleaners cause they were not refilling the shampoo and shower gel in the room. In the infinity pool in the rooftop, No one of the staff said nothing to one group of children were playing with a tennis ball annoying and splashing the other customers. When I complained, they said there not specific rules that is not forbidden playing with a ball in the pool . Even if there’s a children pool and some of the kids were maybe maximum 10 years old. But I would book again"
"323.","Eifel Dastin","10","2025-07-01","1","We arrived late at night at the hotel with expectations of having a good room and a restful night. Unfortunately, it turned into a tiring experience, and we ended up having to change hotels. 1. We decided to bring our own luggage for a faster check-in, as we needed to retrieve something from our bags. The receptionist escorted us only partway—up to the end of the building—and then we were left to find Building 3 on our own. It wasn’t easy, directions weren’t clear, and it started to rain. Thankfully, we met two staff members along the way who kindly offered their help and assisted us to the room. We truly appreciated their support. 2. We were informed that our room was upgraded to a Superior Suite (or whatever name it was called), but it turned out to be two old rooms combined into what they now call a suite. We ended up closing the connecting door because we didn’t even need the living room. 3. We found ants on the table, and the bathroom cleanliness was below expectations. 4. My husband is a Platinum Member, yet there were no welcome amenities or even a simple welcome card. Even if we weren’t going to eat anything, the lack of any acknowledgment made us feel completely unwelcome. 5. When we considered that maybe a smaller room would be better, we went to Reception and asked to switch to a regular room instead of the upgrade. The receptionist didn’t seem to care and didn’t even ask why. He simply said there were no available rooms and offered to move us the next day. He also seemed confused about the Platinum Member upgrade benefits—something he could have easily checked in the system. 6. As we originally planned to spend quality time together, we decided to check out and move to a different hotel brand we trust more than Accor. At Reception, someone finally showed a bit of empathy when asking the reason for our early departure. We just wanted to settle the bill and leave, even though we hadn’t stayed the night. But since the booking was for two nights on a non-refundable rate, another staff member came out to inform us of the terms and conditions. Seriously? At 1 AM, after such a disappointing experience, all we wanted was to leave and rest. Only after we got upset did they begin to apologize—but by then, it was too late. Thank you, Pullman Bali Legian, for the unpleasant night."
"324.","Andrew Benjamin","4","2025-10-01","5","If you’re planning to escape and recharge in the Island of the Gods, Pullman Legian is the perfect spot. The location is super strategic—right in the heart of Legian, just steps away from the beach, shopping streets, and the vibrant Bali nightlife. Whether you’re up for surfing, café hopping, or simply sunset gazing, everything is within walking distance. The service? Simply outstanding. The staff treats you like family, but with that elegant touch of a five-star hotel. I was especially impressed by Ratna, a charming Balinese staff member whose warm smile and attentive service made my stay unforgettable. She embodies the island’s spirit—genuine, graceful, and effortlessly hospitable. The room itself felt like a sanctuary. Spacious, clean, and designed with that modern tropical vibe that makes you want to just kick back, sip a fresh coconut, and forget about deadlines. Waking up to the sound of the ocean while enjoying a private balcony view? Healing mode: ON. ✨ Overall, Pullman Legian is more than just a place to sleep—it’s where you reset your soul. Perfect for a short break, long vacation, or even that spontaneous self-love healing trip. Highly recommended. 🌺🌊 Drew XOXO - @drew_x_7g"
"325.","Jaanika Juul","4","2025-10-01","4","Great views with ocean view room but too noisy for us with traffic and fireworks on beach going up to 1am. Bed was very hard so did not sleep well the whole time we were there. Rooftop pool was good and restaurant was ok. Would definitely rather stay in Ubud or Sanur if we were ever to go back. Too busy and noisy for us. The hard sell pestering on the beach is just too much and ruins your experience as not able to just chill on the beach. Same in the small street shops, would have bought stuff if we could just look around without everyone pestering you and following you around so we just quickly moved on as soon as they started the hard sell."

"345.","Simon Kawanishi","23","2025-05-01","5","We stayed here for 8 nights in mid-April for our 7th wedding anniversary. We we very happy with our stay at the Pullman. The staff went out of their way to make your stay enjoyable and comfortable. On arrival, they left us a well-wishing in our room to acknowledge our anniversary. We had the buffet breakfast every day, which we enjoyed and made for convenience. My two-year-old son spent hours at the pool, and you could not wipe the smile off his face. We felt our room was very spacious for our family. We would definitely return to the Pullman in the future. Location is great and everything you need is within walking distance, including shops, restaurants and the beach."

The room was very spacious and clean; the bed was extremely comfortable and inviting; and the premise was well-manicured and maintained. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful and extremely knowledgeable about the area and the Indonesian culture. Shout out to Yoga, Ayik, Diah, and Astiti, all of whom made the visit and my stay pleasant and enjoyable. The amenities and activities of this resort were also amazing - the gym is well equipped (with multiple fitness course offerings a day), there is a spa on site, and there is a movie on the lawn (with the option to buy theater-type food feet away). The location was also perfect - directly across the street from the beach and within walking distance of many main area attractions to include the popular Beachwalk Mall, local street vendors, many spas and local eateries, and countless beach bars…and the airport just approximately a 15-minute drive away. I highly recommend this resort and would stay here again without any hesitation."
"348.","Tania Maria","16","2025-07-01","5","A five star right at Kuta beachfront, that worthy of your vacation $$$. We had a quick check in and got the luxury of very very late check out (so that we can time our trip to airport comfortably) because of the kindness of the hotel staff who are very accommodating. Two of them, Frans and Ayik, are two of the friendliest staffs who helped us a lot. The rest, from Security team, F&B staffs, Housekeeping team, Gym Staff, and practically every staff we met along the way, are very very kind and helpful. I'll define more experience below. I am so very happy with the facilities, location, room amenities and accessories, also coffee and food qualities. Definitely we'll be back again!"

Location is good,right next to the beach and short walk away from Beachwalk Mall, various rest, etc. We experienced top notch service throughout our stay, from front desk to housekeeping to restaurant staff. Main Pool is a little small but there’s a second rooftop infinity pool with gorgeous views of the beach and ocean. Have stayed at over a dozen Bali hotels over the years and this one scores well on value for money."

It’s a great restaurant and themed dinners through the week keep it all interesting. Others specifically who went out of their way to make this an enjoyable experience were Ayu, Haity, Wila and their very capable teams. Regardless of what you are after from your trip to Bali, the staff really take care of their guests."
"355.","Ni Made Winda Ariesta Natasari","44","2025-10-01","5","I recently attended a workshop at the Uluwatu Room, Pullman Legian Bali. The venue was great, and the staff were very helpful. Special thanks to Wira (banquet/coffee break staff) who kindly helped me and even made me a coffee. I also really appreciated the security staff (forgot the name, the one who did the morning shift on 17th September) who guided me all the way to the workshop room such thoughtful and friendly service!"
"356.","House Mail","4","2025-08-01","1","To pay $350 per night in Kuta you would expect a 5 star hotel - not resort, but hotel. Pullman in Kuta is more of a 3 star hotel, if that. Not even provided fresh milk in the room. Room in bad need of renovation, stinks of mould, ocean view is hardly an ocean view with trees in the way and noisy street, adult pool is full of loud kids. My pool side order was forgotten twice! Had to chase them up and then it took 45 minutes for a bowl of fries to arrive. Massage in the spa was terrible, ended up with a sore neck. The therapist doesn’t know that you’re supposed to go light on bones and deep in the big muscles, flat palm on the hamstrings and thumbs in the back muscles. Instead I got deep thumbs in my hamstrings (ouch) and flat palms over my back until it was raw. It’s like they pluck people off the street with zero training."

"361.","Abdul Jalil Jaafar","1","2025-10-01","5","Review & Commendation for Pullman Hotel I had a wonderful experience at Pullman Hotel. The staff and waitresses were very polite, respectful, and attentive throughout my stay, making me feel truly at home. They constantly checked if we were comfortable, asked if the food was to our liking, and ensured that we had everything we needed. I would like to commend four staff in particular — Seni, Citra, Cahaya, and Ayu — for their exceptional service: • Citra went the extra mile to assist with a late check-out request and personally followed up with the person in charge until everything was settled. • Ayu was warm and thoughtful, taking time to share recommendations on what we could do and where to go in Bali, which made our trip even more meaningful. • Seni carefully prepared my juice without sugar, paying attention to my preferences and making sure I could enjoy it without worry. • Cahaya thoughtfully took my order for the next day’s muesli oats and ensured no sugar was added, showing attentiveness and genuine care. These are just some examples of what they did, but in truth, each of them consistently went beyond expectations in many other ways. Their warmth, professionalism, and teamwork made us feel so welcomed and valued. I would like to suggest that management recognize their efforts — whether through commendation, staff rewards, or opportunities for further growth. They represent Pullman’s high standards of hospitality, and acknowledging them will not only motivate them further but also inspire the rest of the team. Thank you once again for the excellent hospitality. Warm regards, Abdul Jalil/Shanty"

"367.","Akshat Arora","7","2025-07-01","4","I recently stayed at Pullman Bali Legian Beach and found the experience to be a mix of positives and areas for improvement. The location is undoubtedly one of the hotel’s strongest points—conveniently situated just across from the beach and within walking distance of popular spots in Legian and Kuta. The staff were courteous and welcoming throughout my stay, which added to the overall comfort. However, the age of the property is beginning to show. The interiors, especially in the guest rooms and common areas, could benefit from a refresh to meet the expectations typically associated with the Pullman brand. While the hotel retains its charm, a more modern touch would elevate the guest experience. As an Accor ALL Gold member, I was hoping for a more personalised experience or recognition, which unfortunately felt lacking during this visit. While I understand benefits may vary by property, a little acknowledgment can go a long way in making loyalty members feel valued. Overall, it’s a good option for those seeking a beachfront stay with friendly service, but there’s room for improvement in terms of upkeep and loyalty member engagement."

"370.","Olga","1","2025-08-01","4","We booked the hotel in advance (without possibility to cancel) and didn't read any reviews first .Then I investigated reviews and some of them stated that there was a mould smell in the rooms. Once we settled down fortunately no mould smell was in the room. Generally location is good, very close to coastline. Breakfasts are good, the room was clean although old, stuff quite friendly. The only thing happened to us almost at the end of the trip - small lizard in the room. We discovered gaps between the wall and the floor. Fortunately hotel staff eliminated gaps the same day and we didn't see that lizard again. To summarise all the above : hotel quite old , room was clean , stuff quite friendly. I can't recommend this hotel as “must booked” but it was ok(the exception is - lizard in the room). We didn't plan to stay in the hotel all trip - just place for sleep - so it was satisfying."

Outstanding breakfast and the executive chef Wayan Artika and his team were amazing in supporting our needs as my partner has celiac and required a GF menu. The rooms are nice, 2 pools to choose from (+ a kid's pool), ample grounds on the premises, to spread yourself out, a handy gym to work out in, right across form the beach and a short walk to the activities in Kuta/Legian. Highly recommended."

"385.","Jiten Tibrewala","41","2025-08-01","5","Pullman Bali Legian Beach truly exceeded all our expectations. Nestled perfectly between the vibrant energy of Kuta and the relaxed charm of Legian, the location is unbeatable — just steps away from the beach, yet tucked away enough to feel like a peaceful escape. From the moment we arrived, the staff welcomed us with warm smiles and seamless service. Every interaction — whether at check-in, the restaurant, housekeeping, or concierge — reflected genuine hospitality and a true passion for guest satisfaction. The team here is outstanding, always ready to help and incredibly courteous. Our room was spacious, modern, and impeccably clean, with thoughtful amenities and a relaxing ambiance. The balcony overlooking the ocean was the cherry on top — waking up to the sound of waves and a fresh sea breeze was absolute bliss. The rooftop infinity pool is a showstopper — offering stunning views of the beach and sunset. It’s the perfect place to unwind with a cocktail in hand. The ground-level garden pool, too, is tranquil and beautifully landscaped for a more laid-back vibe. Breakfast was a delightful spread — fresh, plentiful, and well-curated. We also appreciated the effort to offer a variety of vegetarian options and healthy choices. The on-site restaurant and bars maintain the same high quality and service throughout the day. We loved the easy access to the beach, nearby shops, spas, and cafes, which made our stay even more enjoyable. Yet, despite being in a lively area, the resort feels serene and relaxing — a rare combination! One suggestion that would further elevate the guest experience: the addition of a Club Lounge. Many Pullman properties and hotels in this category offer this perk, and it would be a fantastic enhancement — especially for loyal Accor members or guests seeking a more premium, private retreat within the resort. Pullman Bali Legian Beach delivers a five-star experience in every sense — comfort, class, convenience, and most importantly, a wonderful team that goes above and beyond. We can’t wait to return and would recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone visiting Bali."
"386.","G G","18","2025-05-01","5","Services are great by the check in staff, porters, rooftop poolside bar staffs. Especially thanks the gym staff who seems a trainer to me, he kept the gym perfectly organized and nice. When I do squat at the Smith rack, he came to help me with wrap the the barbell bar with the towel. Top notch service! Roof top pool and gym are the highlight of the hotel. Only one thing unexpected is yesterday when I checked in around 11am, the toilet on the lobby floor is very dirty. Never seen any hotel toilets like that before… first impression was really down. Lucky is everything else after that is fine."

A heartfelt thank you to Chef Wayan Artika, whose culinary mastery continues to impress, and to Suli, whose warm hospitality made us feel like honored guests. Their dedication and passion truly elevate the experience. Returning felt like coming home to something special.

Ms. Anggita is so caring, she ensured that these four days are our best days in Bali in every possible way.

"409.","Peta Yujnovich","6","2025-10-01","3","We had a family room and the room had a musty smell that I believe was from lack of ventilation and an old air conditioner. This made the room very uncomfortable to sleep in. The pool is also quite small for how large the hotel is. I wouldn't stay at this resort again."
"410.","Jean-Claude Ong","5","2025-08-01","5","Exceptional service from the hospitality team member- Depa. We were given a tour of the evening buffet which made our dining experience more welcoming and special. Keep up with the excellent effort! Well done."
"411.","Reanne Ho","7","2025-06-01","5","I truly feel like I made the perfect choice by staying at Pullman Bali Legian Beach. This was our first little getaway after getting married, and I informed the hotel in advance. We booked one night, and from start to finish, everything felt five star. The environment and service were both amazing. The lobby is spacious and welcoming. We arrived around the standard check-in time, and the front desk staff kindly asked us to wait a bit longer because they were preparing a room that would feel a bit more special. While we were waiting, another staff member noticed and thoughtfully offered us two drink vouchers and two 10-minute neck and shoulder massage experience vouchers. Such a lovely gesture. During check-in, they also confirmed a 3:00 PM late check-out for us, which we really appreciated. When we entered the room, we were touched by a sweet handwritten message, and they had even dimmed the mirror for a more romantic and cozy vibe. A very thoughtful touch. We went for a swim. The pool was clean and relaxing. We used our drink vouchers to chill a bit before heading out for dinner. When we returned to the room later that night, we found a surprise mini cake waiting for us. It was such a heartwarming gesture. Every staff member we encountered was friendly and welcoming. The service was exceptional and made us feel completely at ease throughout our stay. Originally, we did not book breakfast. But after experiencing the beautiful environment and atmosphere of the hotel, we decided to add it on the next morning. It turned out to be a great decision. The breakfast buffet had a wide variety of options and everything was delicious. On the day we checked out, we used our massage vouchers. Even though it was just a 10-minute experience, we could already feel how experienced and skillful the staff were. It was truly relaxing. Unfortunately, we didn’t have enough time to book a full spa treatment this time. But for sure, I will book one on our next visit. A big thank you to all the staff. You truly delivered a five-star experience and made our stay unforgettable. We will definitely be coming back again. Highly recommend!"

I met a security guard and asked him, and the guard said with a smirk, “You’re the one who met with a guest last night, right?” insinuating something. I replied, “That was my fiancé.” And the guard didn’t apologize and continued to speak to me disrespectfully just because I was in a hurry to get to the parking area. Please, if you don’t like Indonesian women, at least be polite and treat me with respect. I’m not an escort, I am a guest. I know you’re on duty, but that’s not nice. I was just disappointed with the security guard’s manners 😔"

"432.","V R","10","2025-08-01","5","Our family of four (two teenage children 18 & 16) recently stayed at Pullman Legian Beach. We were absolutely blown away by the service received during our stay. The members of staff who deserve special mention are (and in no particular order): - Front Office Welcome Manager Dodi; - Front Office Hotel Manager Ardian; - Food & Beverage Manager (aka Superman!) Ari Mahendra; - Restaurant staff Suli; - Concierge Indra; and last but definitely not least... - the GM Ravi. Ravi has built an amazing team and culture at Pullman Legian Beach and it shows clearly in the manner in which the team interact with guests. Nothing was ever too difficult. The breakfast is amazing too, from the usual western breakfast dishes, to the eastern dishes, egg station, pancake/waffle station as well as acai station for the health fanatics! Not forgetting barista coffees. Thank you team Pullman Legian Beach for your wonderful hospitality given to our family. We cannot wait to return!"

"434.","Mark Nerney","5","2025-09-01","5","Stylish, trendy decor and unbeatable location with direct beach access and a short walk to Beachwalk Shopping Center. The Presidential Suite is essentially adjoining rooms with the privacy doors removed, which limits privacy. There’s no club lounge here (as with most Accor Bali properties), only at Sofitel Nusa Dua and Novotel Bali Ngurah Rai Airport. The staff—General Manager Ravi, and Cindy and Adrian—were superb, making the stay memorable. Highly recommended, especially for travelers stopping through Denpasar due to it's close proximity to the airport and families traveling with children."

"436.","Terrena","10","2025-05-01","5","We have stayed at Pullmans Legian many times as we love the location (the beach is across the road and the shops, food, chemist etc are around the corner). All staff are always friendly and happy to help. My husband especially appreciated Citra's help with buying flowers for my birthday and organising staff to place them in our room. It made my birthday so special. We love starting the day with the buffet breakfast and spending time at the infinity pool which is so relaxing as you can see the ocean and get a nice breeze whilst letting the day slip away. Looking forward to our next visit!"

"439.","Teagan Noel","5","2025-08-01","4","We had a mostly great stay at Pullman Legian. Ayu at breakfast was an absolute standout – so warm, friendly and went above and beyond every day. The staff at the infinity pool were also lovely, and the poolside saxophone player created a great atmosphere. The location is perfect and the rooms are modern and well maintained. The only downside was the reception team. Communication was poor and staff often told us things were arranged, only for us to find out later that nothing had been actioned. On one night, we were unable to access our room due to a broken lock and reception simply told us to “leave our luggage and sleep in another room” – no apology, no sense of urgency, and no compensation offered, which was disappointing for a hotel of this standard. That said, Ayu really made our stay memorable! 5 stars for Ayu!!"

"499.","Ankit Shah","104","2026-01-16","1","Pengalaman saya menginap di Pullman Bali Legian Beach sangat mengecewakan karena layanan dasar dan kegagalan koordinasi. Pengalaman terburuk adalah dengan spa. Kami memiliki pemesanan yang telah dikonfirmasi untuk pijat pasangan pukul 15.00 dan telah dengan jelas menyatakan bahwa kami menginginkan pijat pasangan di ruangan yang sama. Ketika kami tiba, kami terkejut menemukan pasangan lain yang dijadwalkan pada waktu yang sama, meskipun spa tersebut tampaknya hanya memiliki satu ruangan pasangan yang beroperasi. Staf kemudian menempatkan kedua pasangan dalam situasi yang sangat canggung dan memalukan, meminta salah satu dari kami untuk menyerahkan ruangan pasangan dan mengambil pijat individu sebagai gantinya. Pasangan lainnya menyebutkan bahwa mereka telah memesan tiga hari sebelumnya. Akhirnya kami pergi tanpa mengambil pijat tersebut. Lebih buruk lagi, hotel awalnya menolak untuk mengembalikan poin Accor yang digunakan untuk pemesanan ini, dengan alasan keterbatasan sistem. Pengembalian dana baru diproses setelah eskalasi ke Manajer Umum. Meskipun saya menghargai bahwa masalah ini akhirnya terselesaikan, seharusnya hal ini tidak memerlukan eskalasi sejak awal. Secara terpisah, kami tidak memiliki air panas di kamar mandi selama menginap. Meskipun telah mengajukan beberapa keluhan, masalah tersebut tidak diperbaiki dengan benar. Pada satu titik kami diberitahu bahwa elemen tersebut telah diganti, tetapi masalahnya masih tetap ada. Ini adalah harapan dasar di hotel mana pun, terutama pada kisaran harga ini. Untuk properti bermerek Pullman, ini adalah kegagalan operasional dan pemulihan layanan yang mendasar. Masalahnya bukan tentang ketidaknyamanan kecil, tetapi tentang sistem dan koordinasi dasar yang tidak berfungsi. Saya tidak akan merekomendasikan hotel ini kecuali ada peningkatan serius dalam cara pengelolaannya dan cara penanganan masalah tamu."

Kami menginap di sini untuk merayakan ulang tahun pernikahan kami dari tanggal 23–27 Desember 2025, dan ternyata itu adalah pengalaman terburuk yang pernah kami alami. Kamar sangat kotor, dan persiapan keseluruhan untuk acara spesial kami sangat mengecewakan. Rasanya seperti staf tidak mengerti seperti apa seharusnya seprai atau handuk yang bersih. Saya sangat menyarankan orang lain untuk menghindari menginap di hotel ini."

Sayangnya, meskipun sudah berulang kali meminta bantuan housekeeping, tidak ada tindakan sampai kami pergi sendiri untuk mencari staf yang bisa membersihkannya! Kami bahkan tidak punya botol air minum, dan stafnya pun tidak peduli! Ini benar-benar tidak pantas bagi tamu hotel. Kursi biliar sangat sedikit dan sayangnya terlihat jelas dari kamar. Hotelnya sangat mahal, dan saya dua kali menemukan rambut di makanan sarapan! Jendela-jendelanya tidak berkaca ganda, dan kebisingan jalan sangat mengganggu — kami tidak bisa tidur atau beristirahat dengan baik."
"502.","Ronak Gandhi","4","2025-11-21","1","Saya telah memesan kamar superior suite untuk 4 orang selama 5 malam dan situs web Anda menampilkan harga berdasarkan 4 orang. Dan ketika kami memasukkan jumlah tamu 2, yang ditampilkan hanya harga berdasarkan 2 orang. Dalam kasus saya, situs Anda menampilkan harga untuk 4 orang dan saya telah memesan kamar. Jelas bahwa harga tersebut sudah termasuk bed and breakfast. Dan di mana pun 4 orang tidak dapat menginap di satu tempat tidur. Jadi tempat tidur harus sudah termasuk dalam harga Anda. Jadi mengapa Pullman memaksa saya membayar biaya tambahan untuk tempat tidur tambahan? Saya telah membayar uang untuk 4 orang di muka dan ketika saya check-in, mereka memaksa saya membayar biaya tambahan untuk tempat tidur tambahan. Jadi mengapa situs Anda menampilkan harga yang meningkat ketika kami memilih 4 orang, bukan 2 orang? Untuk fasilitas apa mereka menaikkan biaya mereka?"

Saya sedang berada di kolam renang dan melihat seorang turis Australia mabuk berdiri di kolam renang dengan sandal jepitnya dan menuangkan bir ke dalamnya. Pemandangan yang menjijikkan. Penyelianya tidak mengatakan apa pun kepadanya. Selain itu, Selama menginap, saya meminta resepsionis untuk kamar yang tenang, dan saya seharusnya tiba di malam hari. Saya terkejut dia menempatkan saya di kamar terburuk di sebelah DJ, dekat kolam renang atas. Kamarnya juga sangat buruk. Pengering rambutnya rusak. Hanya ada selimut kecil, meskipun tempat tidurnya besar! Saya kembali ke resepsionis dan meminta mereka untuk mengganti kamar saya. Resepsionis sebelumnya menempatkan saya di kamar terburuk karena alasan pribadi (yang tidak ingin saya sebutkan). Setelah banyak usaha, kamar itu diganti. Setelah saya pergi, manajer hotel menyambut saya dan meminta maaf atas apa yang telah terjadi. Sejujurnya, saya tidak akan melakukannya lagi. Sebaiknya siapa pun memesan villa dengan harga termurah dan lokasi terbaik."

Selain itu, saya membeli kamar dengan pemandangan laut, tetapi hanya melihat pepohonan yang menghalangi pemandangan. Saya harus mengajukan keluhan untuk mendapatkan pemandangan laut. Staf di meja resepsionis mendapatkan kamar baru, tetapi tidak memberi tahu kami, dan kami harus menunggu berjam-jam untuk mendapatkan kamar baru meskipun sudah siap. Pancurannya rusak. Secara keseluruhan, produknya sudah sangat ketinggalan zaman dan perlu direnovasi."

Pullman tidak menyediakan kamar yang kami pesan, dan bahkan ketika saya menunjukkan dokumen pemesanan yang menjelaskan dengan jelas kamar dan jumlah orang per kamar, mereka membutuhkan waktu 3 jam untuk mengurus kamar kami. Saya menelepon agen tersebut, tetapi manajer hotel menolak untuk berbicara dengannya. Kami akhirnya mendapatkan kunci kamar setelah 3 jam dan panggilan telepon yang tak terhitung jumlahnya tanpa permintaan maaf. Staf hotel tidak ramah, kebanyakan tidak mengerti bahasa Inggris. Area kolam renang mengecewakan dan membosankan, tidak ada musik atau hiburan, dan mustahil untuk menemukan meja saat sarapan. Adik perempuan saya meminta 2 gelas minum tambahan, tetapi mereka mengatakan akan menagihnya $10. Sangat kecewa dengan masa inap kami. Tidak akan merekomendasikannya."
"506.","Eifel Dastin","10","2025-06-21","1","Kami tiba larut malam di hotel dengan harapan mendapatkan kamar yang bagus dan istirahat yang nyaman. Sayangnya, pengalaman itu berubah menjadi melelahkan, dan akhirnya kami harus pindah hotel. 1. Kami memutuskan untuk membawa koper sendiri agar proses check-in lebih cepat, karena kami perlu mengambil sesuatu dari tas kami. Resepsionis hanya mengantar kami sebagian—sampai ujung gedung—dan kemudian kami dibiarkan mencari Gedung 3 sendiri. Itu tidak mudah, petunjuk arahnya tidak jelas, dan mulai hujan. Untungnya, kami bertemu dua anggota staf di sepanjang jalan yang dengan ramah menawarkan bantuan dan membantu kami ke kamar. Kami sangat menghargai dukungan mereka. 2. Kami diberitahu bahwa kamar kami ditingkatkan menjadi Superior Suite (atau apa pun namanya), tetapi ternyata itu adalah dua kamar lama yang digabungkan menjadi apa yang sekarang mereka sebut suite. Kami akhirnya menutup pintu penghubung karena kami bahkan tidak membutuhkan ruang tamu. 3. Kami menemukan semut di atas meja, dan kebersihan kamar mandi di bawah ekspektasi. 4. Suami saya adalah Anggota Platinum, namun tidak ada fasilitas sambutan atau bahkan kartu ucapan selamat datang sederhana. Meskipun kami tidak akan makan apa pun, kurangnya pengakuan apa pun membuat kami merasa sama sekali tidak diterima. 5. Ketika kami mempertimbangkan bahwa mungkin kamar yang lebih kecil akan lebih baik, kami pergi ke Resepsionis dan meminta untuk pindah ke kamar biasa daripada peningkatan kamar. Resepsionis tampaknya tidak peduli dan bahkan tidak bertanya mengapa. Dia hanya mengatakan tidak ada kamar yang tersedia dan menawarkan untuk memindahkan kami keesokan harinya. Dia juga tampak bingung tentang manfaat peningkatan kamar untuk Anggota Platinum—sesuatu yang dapat dengan mudah dia periksa di sistem. 6. Karena awalnya kami berencana untuk menghabiskan waktu berkualitas bersama, kami memutuskan untuk check out dan pindah ke merek hotel lain yang lebih kami percayai daripada Accor. Di Resepsionis, seseorang akhirnya menunjukkan sedikit empati ketika menanyakan alasan keberangkatan kami lebih awal. Kami hanya ingin menyelesaikan tagihan dan pergi, meskipun kami belum menginap semalam. Namun karena pemesanan untuk dua malam dengan tarif yang tidak dapat dikembalikan, anggota staf lain datang untuk memberi tahu kami tentang syarat dan ketentuan. Serius? Pukul 1 pagi, setelah pengalaman yang mengecewakan seperti itu, yang kami inginkan hanyalah pergi dan beristirahat. Baru setelah kami marah, mereka mulai meminta maaf—tetapi saat itu sudah terlambat. Terima kasih, Pullman Bali Legian, atas malam yang tidak menyenangkan ini."

Singkatnya, benar-benar tidak kompeten, tipikal orang Bali, dan terus terang menyebalkan, meskipun Anda anggota setia. Totalnya masih lebih dari €550 untuk empat malam. Lebih parah lagi, akomodasinya menghadap laut, tentu saja, tapi juga menghadap salah satu jalan utama, jadi pasti sangat, sangat, sangat berisik. Frans yang mengurus saya, sangat lambat dan tidak menyenangkan. Lanjutkan."
"508.","House Mail","4","2025-07-21","1","Bahasa Indonesia: Untuk membayar $350 per malam di Kuta Anda akan mengharapkan hotel bintang 5 - bukan resor, tetapi hotel. Pullman di Kuta lebih seperti hotel bintang 3, jika itu. Bahkan tidak disediakan susu segar di kamar. Kamar sangat membutuhkan renovasi, bau jamur, pemandangan laut hampir tidak seperti pemandangan laut dengan pepohonan di jalan dan jalan yang bising, kolam renang dewasa penuh dengan anak-anak yang berisik. Pesanan sisi kolam renang saya terlupa dua kali! Harus mengejar mereka dan kemudian butuh waktu 45 menit untuk semangkuk kentang goreng tiba. Pijat di spa sangat buruk, berakhir dengan leher yang sakit. Terapis tidak tahu bahwa Anda seharusnya melakukannya dengan ringan pada tulang dan dalam pada otot-otot besar, telapak tangan rata pada paha belakang dan ibu jari pada otot punggung. Sebaliknya saya mendapatkan ibu jari yang dalam di paha belakang saya (aduh) dan telapak tangan rata di punggung saya sampai lecet. Sepertinya mereka menarik orang dari jalan tanpa pelatihan."

"511.","Explore With Seb","218","2025-08-21","1","Saya sangat tidak suka memberikan ulasan buruk, karena saya yakin semua orang bisa mengalami hari yang buruk, tetapi membaca ulasannya sepertinya itu bukan sekadar hari yang buruk, melainkan kejadian yang biasa saja. Sebagai pelancong yang sering bepergian, dengan 10-15 perjalanan per tahun, saya mengerti bahwa tidak semua hotel akan sempurna, tetapi saya mengharapkan setidaknya pengalaman yang layak untuk uang yang kami keluarkan. Sebagai informasi, kami memesan sebagai Anggota Emas. 1) Kamar: kami memesan hotel ini setelah melihat foto-foto bagus di situs web Accor. Dalam perjalanan baru-baru ini ke Bali, kami menginap di Grand Mercure di Seminyak dan memutuskan untuk memilih hotel lain kali ini. Setibanya di sana, kami di-upgrade ke superior suite, tetapi tidak ada yang istimewa darinya. Tampilannya sangat kuno, dengan furnitur tua dan bau jamur. Kamarnya sangat lembap kecuali jika Anda menyalakan AC dengan suhu rendah, yang membuat ruangan tidak nyaman. Suara bising dari kolam renang, dan Anda bisa mendengar percakapan dari kamar sebelah. Saya sempat mengeluh tentang kamar tetapi diberitahu bahwa semua kamar telah di-upgrade - ah, sepertinya tidak. 2) Staf: meskipun staf di luar lobi ramah dan membantu, staf check-in bersikap acuh tak acuh dan tidak ramah. Meskipun menyatakan bahwa kami adalah anggota emas, tidak ada layanan tambahan yang ditawarkan sampai kami menanyakannya, termasuk peningkatan kamar. Hal ini dengan jelas menyoroti perlunya meningkatkan keterampilan staf tentang manfaat dari berbagai tingkatan anggota. Ketika menghubungi resepsionis beberapa kali selama menginap, tidak ada yang menjawab atau kami hanya dialihkan ke departemen lain yang kemudian juga tidak menjawab. Layanan tata graha juga buruk, tidak membersihkan kamar dengan benar, meninggalkan makanan di luar kamar selama beberapa hari (tidak yakin untuk apa) dan tidak mengambil jus dari kamar kami yang sudah ada di sana selama beberapa hari dan jelas tidak digunakan. 3) Layanan makan di kamar: beberapa kali sangat terlambat. Malam pertama, terlambat 45 menit dan baru datang setelah mengeluh. Sarapan pagi di hari ketiga memakan waktu lebih dari 50 menit meskipun sudah berbagi, seharusnya 20-25 menit dan tiba dalam keadaan dingin setelah beberapa kali ditindaklanjuti. Satu-satunya kelebihan hotel ini adalah layanan fotonya yang 'gratis', tetapi perlu diketahui bahwa paket foto digitalnya berharga 1,5 juta - tetapi sejujurnya, sepadan. Ada banyak properti di Bali, termasuk di sekitar hotel ini, yang jauh lebih baik dengan harga yang sama. Sangat tidak direkomendasikan dan jangan kembali lagi."

Dan satpam itu tidak meminta maaf dan terus berbicara tidak sopan kepada saya hanya karena saya sedang terburu-buru ke tempat parkir. Tolong, kalau kamu tidak suka perempuan Indonesia, setidaknya bersikaplah sopan dan perlakukan saya dengan hormat. Saya bukan pendamping, saya tamu.

Saya jadi bertanya-tanya apakah kamarnya selalu lembap... Seprainya membuat tidur saya tidak nyaman. +) Setelah check-out, saya memanggil Grab ke bandara, dan resepsionis mengatur sopir taksi, mengatakan saya bisa langsung sampai di sana dengan harga yang sama. Namun, ketika saya keluar, sopirnya meminta dua kali lipat harga awal, yang akhirnya berujung pada pertengkaran. Dalam banyak hal, saya rasa hotel ini kurang memenuhi standar bintang 5 dalam hal pelayanan."

Petugas parkir di lobi tetap duduk, dan tidak ada yang dipanggil untuk membantu. Akhirnya, seorang karyawan wanita datang membawa kereta dorong bayi, tetapi ia sama sekali tidak dapat membantu karena tidak dapat mengangkat bagasi. Di konter check-in, hanya ada satu jendela, jelas kekurangan staf. Sebelum check-in, saya menelepon Pullman dan meminta bak mandi bayi. Perwakilan Pullman mengatakan mereka memilikinya, tetapi resepsionis mengatakan tidak. Saya meminta mereka untuk mengonfirmasi, dan mereka mengonfirmasi bahwa mereka memilikinya. Saya telah menyewa bumper dari tempat lain, tetapi tidak ada di kamar saya ketika saya tiba. Saya meminta staf yang mendorong bagasi untuk memeriksanya, dan butuh waktu 30 menit sebelum barang tersebut diantar. Ini jelas menunjukkan kurangnya pelatihan dan komunikasi staf. Pada hari pertama saya, saya membutuhkan kursi bayi untuk makan anak saya di kamar. Saya menelepon resepsionis, tetapi barang tersebut masih belum tiba setelah 20 menit. Kamar kami hanya berjarak 50 meter dari resepsionis. Istri saya kembali ke resepsionis dan mengatakan kami membutuhkan kursi bayi. Sepuluh menit kemudian, seorang staf datang dan mengatakan mereka akan menyiapkan tempat tidur bayi untuk saya. Pelayanannya sungguh buruk! Sama sekali tidak sesuai dengan yang saya butuhkan. Akhirnya, saya menunggu 50 menit hingga kursi bayi tiba di kamar saya. Pelayanan seperti ini sungguh tidak dapat diterima untuk hotel bintang lima. Stafnya sangat tidak perhatian dan bersikap buruk, dan banyak dari mereka tidak mengerti bahasa Inggris. Saya sangat kecewa dengan Pullman dan pasti tidak akan kembali atau merekomendasikannya kepada teman-teman."

Saya melaporkan masalah jamur dan fakta bahwa dia benar-benar sakit, dan bahwa dia pikir ada masalah jamur, dan meminta mereka untuk memeriksa AC untuk jamur. Mereka memasang pengharum ruangan di kamar kami. Pada hari sebelum kami pergi, (liburan 10 hari) saat ini dia telah menghabiskan separuh liburan kami dengan tidak sehat, tidak makan/minum, kami pergi berbelanja. Dia mengambil ransel perjalanannya dari sudut ruangan, tempat tas itu berada sejak kedatangan kami, tas itu tertutup jamur!!!! Benar-benar putih!!

"519.","Reg YARRAN","4","2025-01-21","1","Pengalaman saya baru-baru ini di Hotel Pullman di Legian sebagai GOLD MEMBER ACCOR sungguh mengecewakan. Saat tiba, staf manajemen di bagian penerima tamu menunjukkan kurangnya profesionalisme yang berdampak negatif pada masa inap saya. Proses check-in di bagian penerima tamu sangat lambat, dengan staf yang tampak tidak terlatih dan acuh tak acuh terhadap kebutuhan tamu. Ketidakefisienan ini diperparah oleh kurangnya komunikasi yang tampak jelas, karena pertanyaan saya tentang fasilitas dan layanan hanya ditanggapi dengan jawaban yang samar dan tidak menarik. Sungguh mengecewakan melihat hotel sekelas ini kurang dalam hal layanan pelanggan dasar, membuat saya merasa kurang dihargai sebagai tamu. Pengalaman bersantap semakin memperparah kekecewaan saya. Kualitas makanannya di bawah standar, kurang rasa dan penyajian, hal yang tidak terduga untuk hotel sekelas Pullman. Staf restoran juga sama buruknya; mereka tampak kewalahan dan kurang perhatian, sering kali meninggalkan meja tanpa pengawasan dalam waktu yang lama. Suatu kali, pesanan saya salah, dan alih-alih segera mengatasi masalah tersebut, staf malah mengabaikannya, menunjukkan kurangnya perhatian terhadap kepuasan pelanggan. Secara keseluruhan, kombinasi layanan yang buruk dan pilihan tempat makan yang kurang memadai membuat kunjungan saya jauh dari menyenangkan, dan saya merasa kecewa dengan keseluruhan pengalaman tersebut."
"520.","Dhiraj Mishra","4","2025-02-21","1","Menginap di sini selama 2 malam dan ini pasti menjadi bagian terburuk dari perjalanan kami di Bali. Bepergian dengan bayi, kami pikir kami akan mengakhiri perjalanan kami dengan nuansa pantai barat dan Pullman tampak seperti pilihan yang bagus untuk menginap, tetapi kami salah besar. Sebelumnya, setelah menginap di properti bintang 5 lainnya, kami mendapati layanan khas Bali yang luar biasa dengan staf yang penuh perhatian dan inklusif yang selalu berusaha membuat masa inap kami nyaman, terutama karena kami membawa bayi. Pullman benar-benar merusak pengalaman ini bagi kami. Saat check-in, tidak ada yang membantu kami membawa barang bawaan, kami berhasil membawanya berkat sopir kami yang baik hati (bukan staf Pullman). Staf di sini sangat tidak terlibat dan tidak peduli dengan tamu yang datang, dan ini sudah jelas sejak awal. Kami keliru memesan kamar dengan tempat tidur twin dan meminta beberapa kali sebelumnya bahwa kami membutuhkan tempat tidur King (biaya per malam untuk keduanya sama) dan permintaan ini dikonfirmasi oleh staf reservasi. Bahkan 3-4 hari sebelum kami menginap, kami mendapat konfirmasi bahwa hal ini telah diatur untuk kami, tetapi pada saat check-in, kami diberi tahu secara keliru bahwa tidak ada kamar yang tersedia dan baru setelah mereka mengetahui bahwa kami telah memesan sebelumnya, tiba-tiba ada kamar yang tersedia. Pelayanan di sini sangat lambat sehingga kami pernah harus menunggu hampir satu jam untuk mendapatkan botol air. Selain itu, ada aturan aneh bahwa Anda tidak bisa mendapatkan lebih dari 5 botol air gratis dalam sehari. Ketika diminta klarifikasi tentang aturan ini dan di mana tepatnya hal yang sama disebutkan, tidak ada kejelasan yang diberikan. Sebaliknya, mereka mulai mengatakan bahwa mereka membuat pengecualian untuk kami, tetapi tetap tidak ada penjelasan tentang aturan bodoh ini. Kamarnya tidak sesuai dengan label bintang 5 dan paling banter biasa-biasa saja. Kondisi keseluruhannya tampak kuno dan membutuhkan perawatan yang cukup lama. Fasilitas yang disediakan sangat buruk kualitasnya. Bahkan proses check-out pun kacau karena staf tidak ada dan orang-orang mengantre untuk pergi. Satu-satunya kelebihan properti ini adalah lokasinya yang jauh dari keramaian, namun tetap terasa seperti bukan di sana. Saya tidak akan kembali lagi! Sangat tidak direkomendasikan jika Anda bepergian dengan bayi kecil."
"521.","Sasha","28","2025-01-21","1","Proses check-in sangat disayangkan, kami berdiri di sana selama 15 menit bahkan sebelum disambut, tidak ada permintaan maaf, minuman selamat datang, atau apa pun, hanya disuruh duduk dan seseorang akan membantu kami. Kemudian seorang staf datang dan meminta paspor, dan tidak kembali selama 15 menit. Akhirnya kami dibawa ke kamar, setelah meminta kamar yang tenang, kami diberi kamar di lantai dasar di depan kolam renang anak-anak, Anda hanya bisa membayangkan kebisingannya! Kami diminta untuk dipindahkan ke kamar lain, jadi kami dipindahkan ke area lain, dan yang kami dengar hanyalah konstruksi, dentuman, dll. Pada tahap ini kami benar-benar muak dan mencari akomodasi alternatif. Sayangnya saya telah membayar di muka untuk 6 malam penuh dan itu tidak dapat dikembalikan dan mereka tidak akan mengakomodasi kami dengan pengembalian uang apa pun. Sebaliknya, mereka menawarkan untuk memindahkan kami, untuk ketiga kalinya keesokan harinya. Keesokan harinya tiba dan kami tidak mendengar apa pun dari mereka. Kami harus pergi ke resepsionis pukul 3.30 dan bertanya lagi. Kali ini kami dipindahkan ke lantai dasar di belakang Spa, memang jauh lebih tenang. Rupanya itu peningkatan, kami tidak yakin bagaimana, mungkin karena ada sofa. Kamar berbau jamur, gordennya banyak bercak/lubang usang, jadi cahaya terus masuk. Jendela belakang menghadap ke area resor yang mati, sangat tidak menyenangkan. Kamar mandinya ada bercak jamur besar di atap, saya kira itu sebabnya baunya? Kami menginap 6 malam dan mungkin mandi air panas total 3 kali, airnya selalu hampir tidak hangat. Kami melaporkannya dan diberi tahu bagian pemeliharaan akan memeriksanya, tetapi lagi-lagi kami tidak pernah mendapat kabar lagi. Beberapa hari kamar kami baru dirapikan pukul 16.00 dan kemudian perlengkapan mandi tidak diisi ulang. Kami meminta check-out terlambat, dan lagi-lagi kami diberi tahu bahwa mereka akan memberi tahu kami, lagi-lagi kami tidak pernah mendapat kabar dari mereka! Kolam renang khusus dewasa menghadap ke tempat parkir, jika Anda melihat lebih jauh, laut terlihat. Kolam renangnya hangat suam-suam kuku, kedalamannya hanya sekitar 1,2 meter, dan setiap orang di atas 45 tahun telah meletakkan handuk dan buku mereka di kursi dek pada pukul 8 pagi, tetapi tidak ada seorang pun yang terlihat, sangat tidak menyenangkan. Stafnya ramah dan selalu ada, seperti yang biasa kami alami di Bali, begitu pula staf saat sarapan. Kelebihannya adalah pilihan sarapan yang baik dan lokasi yang strategis di pantai. Kelebihannya adalah staf mengirimkan kue ulang tahun dan sekeranjang buah untuk kami, selain itu pengalaman menginap yang sangat tidak menyenangkan, dan tidak akan pernah menginap lagi dan tidak akan membandingkannya dengan resor Pullman mana pun di dunia. 5 kunjungan ke Bali dan sejauh ini ini adalah pengalaman terburuk kami, dan kami telah menginap di berbagai akomodasi, vila, dll. dan sangat menyadari standarnya, tetapi ini sangat buruk terutama untuk harga yang kami bayar, tentu saja bukan harga murah di Bali, artinya Anda mendapatkan apa yang Anda bayar. Hal itu tidak mengurangi kecintaan kami pada Bali, tetapi tentu saja tidak akan merekomendasikan akomodasi ini kepada siapa pun."
"522.","Joey Yap","11","2025-01-21","1","Saya menginap semalam, dan itu benar-benar pengalaman hotel terburuk yang pernah saya alami. Rombongan teman kami memesan total 8 kamar, dan ketika kami check-in setelah pukul 15.00, kami diberi tahu bahwa salah satu kamar belum siap. Ini benar-benar tidak bisa diterima, apalagi mengingat waktu check-in yang tertera adalah setelah pukul 15.00. Kemudian, setelah seharian beraktivitas, saya kembali ke hotel lewat tengah malam. Saat hendak mandi, saya baru menyadari bahwa botol berlabel kondisioner sebenarnya adalah body lotion. Saya butuh hampir satu jam menyisir dan membilas rambut saya terus-menerus untuk membersihkannya. Keesokan harinya, saya pergi ke resepsionis untuk melaporkan masalah tersebut, dan tanggapannya sungguh tidak memuaskan. Resepsionis hanya berkata, Terima kasih atas masukan Anda; saya akan memberi tahu tim housekeeping. Tidak ada permintaan maaf, tidak ada pengakuan atas ketidaknyamanan yang saya alami—hanya kurangnya profesionalisme. Lebih parah lagi, petugas concierge tidak ramah dan penanganan keluhan secara keseluruhan sangat buruk. Satu-satunya hal positif dari masa inap saya adalah mereka mengizinkan saya check-out terlambat pukul 15.00. Sayangnya, hal ini tidak menutupi pengalaman buruk secara keseluruhan. Saya tidak akan menginap di Pullman lagi."

Sebagai Accor platinum, saya mendapat kamar suite yang ditingkatkan untuk keluarga dengan 3 orang dewasa. Lobi tampak baik-baik saja, proses check-in cepat. Kamar suite berbau 'berjamur' dan tidak menyenangkan. Kami tidak terlalu nyaman tetapi hanya untuk 2 malam jadi biarkan saja. Kami membuka balkon untuk mengangin-anginkannya tetapi tidak banyak membantu. Pada pagi ke-2, kami menekan tanda untuk ruang rias. Setelah seharian keluar, kamar tidak dirapikan tetapi handuk bersih di tempat tidur dan keset toilet dibawa pulang dan tandanya mati. Saya menelepon bagian tata graha karena tidak merapikan tetapi tandanya mati, alasannya adalah pembuatan kamar ditolak?? Sarapan tidak sesuai dengan standar Pullman, banyak lalat di area roti. Ada seseorang yang membuat kopi saat dipesan. Jadi semua orang harus mengantri untuk memesan dan menunggu kopi!!! Sistem yang bodoh terutama ketika ada banyak orang. Kami harus membuang waktu mengantri dan menunggu kopi. Mengapa tidak hanya 2 mesin dan itu akan cepat. Lokasinya bagus untuk pecinta pantai, tepat di seberang pantai. Kalau tidak, saya tidak akan merekomendasikan hotel ini. Sangat sulit untuk mencapai Pullman. Bahkan, untuk anggota Accor, Mercure memiliki lokasi yang jauh lebih baik dan harga yang terjangkau. Mercure lebih mudah diakses dari tempat makan. Ngomong-ngomong, saya pasti tidak akan kembali ke hotel ini lagi dan pasti tidak akan merekomendasikannya kepada siapa pun meskipun saya selalu menjadi penggemar berat Pullman, tetapi tidak untuk yang ini."

Staf tata graha mulai membersihkan pukul 07.00, yang juga terdengar dari dalam kamar. Saat sarapan, Anda mendapatkan hampir semua yang dibutuhkan untuk makan siang, tetapi bukan yang terpenting, seperti ham untuk sarapan. Anda harus membayar uang jaminan yang sangat besar, tetapi setelah tujuh hari, uang itu masih belum dicairkan. Hotel ini sama sekali bukan bintang lima. Mungkin saya akan memberinya tiga bintang. Kamar dan furniturnya sangat tua dan tidak terawat. Misalnya, ada noda kerak kapur di mana-mana."

Kamar kedua adalah kamar suite yang menghadap ke taman dan sangat tua, berjamur, dan tidak ada air panas. Entah bagaimana, ada nyamuk di dalam kamar juga, dan kami digigit sangat parah ketika bangun keesokan paginya. Anda bisa melihat foto-foto betapa buruknya kondisi kamar tersebut. Mereka menawari kami untuk menginap di kamar lain dan kami mendapati sprei tempat tidurnya penuh dengan bau parfum. Saya tidak menggunakannya, jadi saya bisa membayangkan sprei itu tidak diganti oleh tamu sebelumnya. Sungguh pengalaman yang sangat buruk. Jangan buang-buang uang Anda untuk menginap di sini. Sungguh mengerikan."

Anda harus bertanya di belakang konter telur/stasiun telur untuk bacon, yang mana sangat aneh dan tidak ada tanda yang menjelaskan di mana mendapatkan bacon tersebut. Saya melihat orang lain mendapatkan bacon di sini. - sarapannya sangat mahal mengingat Anda bisa berjalan kaki menyusuri jalan dan mendapatkan sarapan bintang lima lengkap dengan sepertiga dari harga tersebut. - tidak akan memesan lagi. - Ada hotel lain di ujung jalan di lokasi tepi pantai yang menawarkan lingkungan yang jauh lebih mewah dengan harga/biaya yang sama. - nilai plusnya adalah lokasinya yang fantastis di pantai. - Jalur untuk berjalan kaki sangat mengejutkan dan cukup berbahaya, jadi jika Anda memiliki anak kecil atau memiliki masalah berjalan sendiri, Anda harus sangat berhati-hati."

Kami memesan suite dan diberikan kamar yang gelap, suram, dan bau yang rusak, tepat di atas area kerja konstruksi tempat pekerjaan pembongkaran dan pengeboran berlangsung sepanjang hari. Tidak ada waktu istirahat yang memungkinkan, padahal yang saya inginkan hanyalah tidur hampir sepanjang waktu. Kami dipindahkan ke kamar lain, yang sedikit lebih baru, tetapi saya bingung logika apa yang mendasari desainnya. Pintu utama mengarah ke kamar tidur, dan tidak ada yang berfungsi di ruang keluarga (mengapa konsol TV dan stopkontak tidak bisa tetap berada di ruang keluarga dan menjaga kamar tidur tetap tenang?). Hasilnya juga tidak ada waktu istirahat, keluar masuk kamar berarti harus melewati kamar tidur. Saya juga tidak mengerti bagaimana ruang makan utama tidak memiliki AC. Kamar dingin sepanjang hari, tetapi entah kenapa mereka tidak bisa menjaga ruang makan tetap sejuk. Kami harus berebut tempat makan di luar. Makanannya lumayan. Terakhir, pelayanannya. Mereka butuh 2 jam untuk membawa barang bawaan kami ke kamar. Mereka tidak tahu kamar mana yang kami tuju ketika mereka memindahkan kami. Kami sudah berkemas pukul 12 siang, diminta menunggu hingga pukul 2 siang, dan baru diberi tahu pukul 3 sore bahwa kami harus menunggu lebih lama hingga pukul 5 sore. Dan ketika istri saya melewati resepsionis 20 menit kemudian, kunci kamar baru tergeletak begitu saja di atas meja. Fasilitas dasar sulit ditemukan dan perlu banyak tindak lanjut untuk mendapatkannya (misalnya papan setrika, setrika). Harga yang dibayarkan untuk ini sungguh keterlaluan. Dan menyebut kamar 'suite' itu menyesatkan, selain dari ruang yang terbuang dan tidak berfungsi. Saya masih punya beberapa hari di sini dan saya senang akan menghabiskan sebagian besar waktu di luar. Sayangnya, semuanya sudah dibayar di muka. Saya tidak sabar untuk check-out, dan melupakan kejadian ini. Bali memang luar biasa dan saya akan kembali lagi. Hotel ini perlu melakukan lebih banyak hal untuk mempertahankan reputasinya sebagai hotel bintang 5 dan branding Accor. Sampai saat itu, hotel ini masuk daftar hitam saya."

Sejak hari pertama, saya belum mandi air panas sama sekali karena masalah air, dan saya sudah pindah kamar 6 kali dan melihat-lihat 5 kamar lainnya. Kompensasi terbaik yang pernah saya terima adalah makan untuk dua orang atas masalah yang saya alami. Saya telah memesan hotel ini untuk 7 teman saya untuk liburan yang menyenangkan di luar negeri. Dari 7 kamar tamu yang berbeda, 4 kamar mengalami masalah seperti AC rusak dan masalah air. Ada banyak hotel lain dengan harga yang sama di Bali, JANGAN BUANG-BUANG UANG ANDA UNTUK LIBURAN YANG HANCUR. Saya sudah berada di resepsionis sampai pukul 23.00 dan tidak ada solusi untuk masalah yang kami hadapi. Saya sangat terkejut hotel ini memiliki ulasan yang bagus dan berbintang tinggi. Karena kami memesan melalui Jetstar, kami tidak bisa mendapatkan pengembalian dana untuk memesan di tempat lain. Kami sekarang mulai mempertimbangkan untuk membayar sendiri agar bisa pindah ke hotel lain yang menyediakan air panas. Saya akan memberi kurang dari 1 bintang kalau bisa."

Ketika kami tiba di hari pertama, sangat bising, mereka mungkin melakukan renovasi tepat di atas kamar kami sepanjang hari. Tidak bisa istirahat sama sekali. SOP tamunya kurang bagus. Semua hotel bintang 4-5 bagus yang kami miliki sebelumnya sangat ramah dengan gojek/gofood. Di sini, mereka tidak terima diantar ke concierge, tamu harus mengambilnya di gerbang depan tepat pada saat gojek tiba. Mereka mengatakan untuk alasan kebersihan dan keamanan, yang tidak masuk akal, tidak akan ada perbedaan besar karena alasan itu jika mereka menaruhnya di petugas. Sedangkan hotel besar lainnya akan mengantarkannya ke kamar. Kalau di masa Covid iya, masuk akal tapi sekarang tidak. Sangat kecewa tidak memudahkan tamunya. Suatu malam kami menginap, ada acara grup dengan panggung tepat di depan kamar kami, tanpa pemberitahuan apa pun, sedangkan apa yang kami alami di hotel bagus lainnya, mereka selalu mengirimkan surat ke kamar sebagai pemberitahuan terlebih dahulu. Dan mereka membangun panggung dan persiapan dengan suara keras sepanjang hari. Kami tidak merasakan pengalaman menginap yang menyenangkan di Bali di hotel ini."

Ketika kami akhirnya sampai di kamar, ada bau busuk. Ruangan itu mengerikan, tua, lelah, cat jatuh dari dinding, plester runtuh, karat di kamar mandi. Pengalaman buruk dan suite tersebut terdiri dari kamar sebelah yang jelek dan membosankan dengan satu sofa dan tidak ada yang lain. Pas banget buat backpacker kalau gitu. Kami mengatur untuk pindah ke hotel lain keesokan paginya dan staf di Pullman menyetujui pengembalian dana namun saya masih menunggu untuk menerima pengembalian dana ini atau konfirmasi email apa pun 14 hari kemudian. Terlalu menambah kesusahan saya saat membaca buku di tepi kolam renang menunggu untuk pergi. Saya didekati oleh tamu lain yang saya perhatikan sedang memperhatikan putri kecil saya dari jauh. Dia mengatakan kepada saya bahwa menurutnya dia cantik, bisakah dia mendapatkan akun instagramnya dan apa yang kami lakukan untuk makan malam - DIA 16 tahun.

Kami semua puas dengan kamar kami, sangat nyaman, dan dilayani setiap hari dengan standar terbaik. Fasilitasnya sangat baik, begitu pula lokasinya.

"536.","Chris","1058","2020-01-21","1","Secara keseluruhan, kamar hotelnya kuno, kotor, dan bahkan bau. Hotel ini tidak sepadan dengan harganya. Saya memesan hotel ini selama 5 malam dan tidak mendapatkan pengalaman menginap yang menyenangkan. Saya telah menginap di banyak hotel Accor dari semua kelas dan ini adalah yang terburuk yang pernah saya alami. Layanan: Kami seharusnya dijemput dari bandara, sebuah layanan berbayar yang dengan senang hati saya setujui, memberikan detail penerbangan saya, dan mengonfirmasi. Kami tiba tepat waktu, imigrasi memakan waktu sekitar setengah jam. Saat keluar, kami meluangkan waktu dan memeriksa setiap tanda di gerbang kedatangan sambil diganggu (seperti yang kami duga - tidak mengeluh tentang ini) oleh banyak pengemudi taksi. Kami mencari selama setengah jam dan tidak menemukan pengemudi kami, jadi kami memesan GoJek dan tiba di hotel. Saya memberi tahu staf, mereka tidak tahu apakah pengemudinya sudah pergi atau belum dan hanya mengabaikannya. Ini terjadi tengah malam, bukan sambutan yang menyenangkan. Kami pergi ke kamar kami, itu adalah ulang tahun pasangan saya dan sekali lagi saya mengatur sesuatu saat kedatangan dan bahkan setuju untuk membayar apa pun. Di email, dikonfirmasi bahwa mereka akan menyediakan piring buah atau kue, tapi tidak ada apa-apa di sana - benar-benar lupa. Kamarnya cukup menjijikkan - ada jamur di wastafel, semuanya usang dan rasanya seperti ada ratusan pesta di ruangan ini dan tempat itu terus-menerus berantakan. Lampu berdiri setengah miring dan tidak berfungsi, lampunya rusak, pancuran menetes, tidak ada tekanan sama sekali dan secara keseluruhan itu benar-benar buruk. Kami pindah dua hari ke kamar lain karena kebisingan dari jalan (ini tidak masalah, Anda tidak bisa menghindari kebisingan) dan kamar baru itu benar-benar nyaman dan tenang. Kamarnya masih tua, ada jamur di wastafel lagi (jenis hijau terang). Kejutan terbesar adalah bau selokan yang tersamar dengan baik pada beberapa hari pertama tetapi saya mendapati setelah kami tinggal lebih lama dan meninggalkan kamar dan kembali, baunya hampir tak tertahankan. Namun stafnya sangat ramah dan secara umum layanannya cepat dan tepat waktu. Saya tidak merekomendasikan menginap di sini. Cari yang lebih baik dengan harga ini."

Meskipun resepsionis menyuruh saya segera mengirim seseorang, tidak ada yang datang sampai tengah malam. Saya menyerah dan pergi tidur. Kamarnya basah semua. Air mengalir di dinding. Saya memeriksa kelembapan dan menemukan kelembapan lebih dari 89%. Ada petunjuk arah yang tidak mengatur suhu lebih rendah dari 22 derajat. Saya menghabiskan malam yang sangat dingin dan lembap. Keesokan paginya, saya bertemu dengan manajer shift pukul 9 pagi dan berjanji untuk mencari kamar alternatif. Mereka membuat saya menunggu dan baru bisa pindah kamar pukul 1 siang hari itu. Hancur satu malam dan sepanjang pagi. Pengalaman terburuk dalam beberapa tahun. Meskipun manajer shift meminta maaf, saya tidak bisa merasakan ketulusan. Saya rasa karena hal ini sering terjadi dan tidak ada cara untuk memperbaikinya, sehingga pihak hotel terbiasa dengan keluhan tersebut. Saya tidak mengungkapkan kemarahan dan kekecewaan saya karena tidak ingin merusak sisa liburan karena hotel yang buruk. Saya harap pihak hotel tidak menanggapi apa pun. Ketika saya membaca ulasan serupa, saya benci tanggapan pihak hotel."

Pada hari kedua, saat sarapan, kami dilayani oleh seorang pelayan dan diarahkan ke meja di luar dekat kolam renang karena meja di dalam penuh. Kami setuju dan berdiri di samping meja, siap untuk duduk, ketika tiba-tiba seorang pelayan dari dalam menarik kursi dari meja yang kami pilih, untuk diberikan kepada pelanggan lain dari luar negeri. Pengalaman yang sangat tidak sopan. Saya bahkan menulis email keluhan tetapi belum menerima balasan hingga saat ini. Lebih lanjut, saat check-out, ketika saya membawa koper saya ke restoran, pelayan MEMERINTAH saya untuk menitipkannya ke resepsionis di meja depan. Ini berbeda dengan pengalaman saya di hotel Pullman lainnya, di mana mereka membantu saya membawakan koper saya. Selain itu, Pullman ini tidak memiliki lounge eksekutif."

Ini adalah satu-satunya pilihan yang tersedia saat Anda memesan kamar bersama keluarga secara online. Kami memesan taksi di hotel ini dan mereka menagih saya Rp325.000 ($AU 32,5) dari bandara ke hotel yang biasanya sekitar $8,00 dengan taksi biasa (7-8 km dari hotel). Kami tiba sekitar tengah malam dan diberi suite satu kamar tidur di lantai 4. Kami sangat lelah dan hanya mengikuti apa yang dikatakan staf. Kunci kamar yang diberikan tidak berfungsi sehingga staf harus turun dan membawa kunci baru (menunggu 20 menit dalam cuaca yang sangat panas dengan anak-anak saya yang berteriak-teriak). Tidak ada ucapan selamat datang atau mainan handuk atau kue atau potongan buah yang dibuat di tempat tidur seperti yang ditunjukkan dalam video online. Saat kami memasuki kamar, ada bau menyengat seperti cat kayu dan tenggorokan saya gatal. Tetapi karena kami lelah, kami menerima kamar tersebut. Kamar mandi memiliki bau selokan yang kuat selama menginap. Di pagi hari saya mencoba menghubungi resepsionis tetapi telepon tidak pernah berfungsi. Saya pergi ke resepsionis hampir 4 kali untuk pindah kamar. Saya selalu dilayani oleh staf baru di resepsionis dan diberi harapan palsu. Akhirnya pada malam hari kami diberi kamar lain di mana kami tinggal sampai 25.01.24. Kamar nomor .2102 lantai dasar suite satu kamar tidur. Kamar itu lebih baik daripada yang diberikan sebelumnya tetapi tidak sepadan dengan uang yang saya bayarkan untuk menginap di sini. Hotel ini sangat tua dan membutuhkan renovasi segera. Menurut pendapat pribadi saya, ini maksimal hotel bintang 3 yang menyamar sebagai hotel bintang lima. Lokasi hotel ini bagus. Pantai di seberang jalan. Sarapannya beragam. Stafnya sangat membantu."

Seseorang membawa troli di lorong dan suaranya sangat keras. Aku bisa mendengar tamu-tamu di sebelah kami, setiap kata sampai mereka tidur.

Sama sekali tidak layak bintang 5. Memilih tarif fleksibel penuh, saat check-in mereka meminta kami membayar semuanya di muka (tidak pernah terjadi pada kami sebelumnya) untuk tiga kamar selama 12 malam, ketika kami meminta check-out lebih awal, mereka meminta biaya pembatalan satu malam (yang terdengar wajar bagi saya) TETAPI mereka tidak akan mengembalikan dana apa pun ke kartu saya tetapi hanya voucher untuk dibelanjakan di hotel atau menginap berikutnya di hotel ini. -> sungguh lucu! Setiap hari mereka memutar daftar putar lagu yang sama selama satu jam 24 jam sehari, saat sarapan/makan siang/makan malam. Begitu juga dengan spa. Oh dan spa-nya….hanya pijat. Kolam renang telah ditutup, sauna juga. Jadi hanya pijat. Tapi Anda membayar untuk pengalaman spa.

Kamarnya sangat buruk - Kesalahan terbesar kami memesan kamar dengan pemandangan laut, semua yang mungkin terjadi salah, kamar penuh bau jamur dan air di dinding karena lembap, seprai kamar memiliki bintik-bintik merah, pintunya rusak dan kami harus pindah kamar hanya untuk menemukan masalah serupa di kamar baru. - Kebisingan sepanjang malam, dari jalan raya, dari kamar-kamar di sekitar, dan bahkan jika seseorang berjalan di luar, Anda dapat mendengarnya dengan keras dan jelas. - Lampu samping sudah tua dan kusam, penuh karat dan debu. - Telepon genggam di kamar buruk dengan sinyal buruk, staf membutuhkan waktu lama untuk menjawab panggilan kami, baik itu binatu, layanan kamar, atau operator. - AC kamar perlu diatur pada suhu tertentu agar Anda tetap dingin sepanjang waktu untuk menghindari kelembapan di dinding, jamur terlihat jelas di sudut-sudut dinding, penerimaan tidak membantu untuk beralih. 3. Kamar mandi luas tetapi kotor. - Jamur terlihat di wastafel. - Wastafel agak tersumbat dan membutuhkan waktu lama. - Toilet kecil dan terlihat kotor di mana-mana, Anda dapat mendengar suara siraman dari kamar di atas, jadi nikmatilah. 4. Spa di Dalam Hotel Tarif lebih baik daripada hotel lain tetapi biaya pemerintah 21% yang keterlaluan membuatnya menjadi penghalang. 5. Lift terbatas dan lembap sekali. Sangat kecil dan 1 lift per sayap butuh waktu lama untuk sampai. 6. Area sarapan. - Dari mana saya harus mulai, ini salah satu sarapan terburuk yang kami nikmati, lalat terlihat di atas roti. Mentega asin tidak tersedia. Sebaiknya bangun pagi pukul 6.30 pagi untuk sarapan. Kalau tidak, akan sulit menemukan pilihan lain jika terlambat.

Sangat sangat kekurangan staf. Meskipun tertulis bahwa waktu check-in adalah pukul 14.00, mereka membuat kami menunggu lebih dari satu jam. Ini sangat menegangkan dan merepotkan karena kami bepergian dengan bayi dan balita. Tolong jangan berharap mereka menjelaskan dan meminta maaf karena mereka tidak akan melakukannya. Mereka hanya akan membuat Anda menunggu dan mengabaikan Anda (kecuali jika Anda berbicara langsung dengan manajer). 2. Kami terkunci di luar kamar dan HARUS mengganti kunci setiap hari. Rupanya mereka tidak tahu cara menggunakan sistem mereka. Alih-alih memeriksa secara internal, mereka hanya akan mengganggu Anda dan bertanya kapan Anda akan check-out. Sikap yang sangat buruk. 3. Masalah terakhir dan paling menjengkelkan adalah mereka tidak akan membantu kami menyimpan pesanan Gojek atau Grab, bahkan tidak semenit pun. Bahkan saat hujan deras, TAMU AS harus berjalan ke pos keamanan tanpa payung hanya untuk mengambil pesanan. Bukan, ini bukan yang diinginkan para pengemudi karena menunggu kami lebih lama daripada sekadar mengantar barang. Saya pernah menginap di hotel seperti Apurva dan Mulia dan mereka tidak pernah memperlakukan tamu atau pengemudi mereka dengan tindakan serendah dan sehina itu.

Ia menyebutkan hal ini terjadi karena keterlambatan check-in yang dilakukan oleh tim pemerintah, dan karena alasan keamanan, mereka harus memberikan kamar kami untuk rombongan tersebut! Saya harus berteriak lagi di telepon menjelaskan kepadanya bahwa ini bukan standar dan perlakuan yang dapat diterima, terutama karena kami memesannya jauh-jauh hari. Semua kamar sudah dibayar, dan pilihan terbaik yang dia berikan adalah lounge eksekutif dan makan malam bertema! Setelah saya katakan kepadanya, saya perlu menyelesaikan masalah ini atau panggilan telepon berikutnya akan datang dari pengacara perusahaan kami. Setengah jam kemudian, akhirnya 1 suite siap!

Saya setuju dengan komentar sebelumnya dari orang lain tentang harga alkohol yang terlalu tinggi, terutama jika ditambah pajak dan biaya layanan. Yang lebih buruk lagi, selama menginap kami diusir dari area kolam renang infinity karena ada acara pribadi yang dipesan, yang sangat menjengkelkan dan terasa seperti kami telah membayar untuk menggunakan fasilitas tersebut tetapi acara pribadi lebih penting. Kami hanya diberi tahu maaf dan ada kolam renang taman yang bisa digunakan sebagai gantinya. Tidak cukup baik dan tidak dapat diterima bagi tamu yang membayar. Malam berikutnya, hotel tersebut menyelenggarakan acara pribadi lain untuk sebuah perusahaan Indonesia yang berarti area berumput yang digunakan untuk anak-anak bermain dan bersantai tidak dapat diakses hampir sepanjang hari untuk mendapatkan lebih banyak uang dari tamu perusahaan. Ini sama sekali tidak dapat diterima dan tidak dijelaskan kepada kami saat kami memesan liburan bintang 5 yang santai. Saya tidak akan merekomendasikan hotel ini kepada siapa pun yang menginginkan bintang 5 dan pengalaman yang berfokus pada pelanggan."
"564.","Erwin Susilohadi","30","2019-01-21","1","Bagus: Kolam renang infinity (satu-satunya hal bagus tentang tempat ini). Buruk: Ada sedikit kebingungan dengan staf resepsionis mengenai sarapan. Staf mengatakan kami hanya mendapatkan 2 sarapan, bukan 4. Hal ini dijelaskan setelah mereka memeriksanya satu jam kemudian. Hanya kerumitan yang tidak perlu. Konfigurasi kamar di suite apartemen 2 kamar tidur aneh karena kamar-kamar-ruang tamu, bukan kamar-ruang tamu-kamar. Anggota keluarga yang lain harus melewati kamar saya untuk menuju ruang tamu, yang berarti privasi saya berkurang. Pintu kamar mandi rusak (tergelincir keluar rel) dan istri saya terjebak di dalam. Setelah staf mengeluarkan istri saya, departemen teknik mengatakan mereka akan segera memperbaikinya, tetapi setelah menunggu 1 jam tidak ada yang datang. Perbaikan mereka saat kami tidak ada adalah paku di pagar. Ruang tamu apartemen 2 kamar tidur pada dasarnya hanya satu ruangan kosong. 2 kursi dengan meja kecil, 1 sofa untuk 2 orang, ditambah satu TV (foto terlampir). Kami perlu mengambil kursi dari kamar untuk mengobrol. Sofa agak kurang nyaman karena bisa juga berfungsi sebagai sofa bed. Toiletnya juga bau, kami curiga ada bau selokan. Biasa saja: Sarapannya sesuai harapan. PS: Saya masih di kamar saat menulis ini, tidak sabar untuk pulang. Saya rasa hotel ini tidak berstandar Pullman karena saya pernah menginap di beberapa Pullman sebelumnya (kota lain di Indonesia, Australia, Selandia Baru, dan Vietnam). Dengan harga apartemen 2 kamar tidur ini, kami bisa menginap di tempat lain yang lebih baik dan mungkin lebih murah. Saya sama sekali tidak merekomendasikan hotel ini untuk menginap."

"566.","Nigel Le Grice","39","2022-01-21","1","Sebagai anggota Platinum Accor, saya menginap di banyak hotel Accor sekitar 60 malam setahun. Hotelnya seharusnya bintang 3, bukan bintang 5. Tidak ada surat sambutan. Minuman selamat datang berupa jus, bukan bir atau anggur. Alasannya, karena COVID. Spa masih tutup, tetapi di hotel Accor lain di Bali, spa buka, tetapi tidak di sini. Staf berbagi lift dengan Anda dan barang bawaan Anda. Ironisnya, beberapa protokol COVID sudah diterapkan, tetapi yang lain diabaikan, seperti protokol keselamatan. Tapi saya senang berhemat dengan hadiah selamat datang, minuman, dan pijat gratis. Kami menginap akhir pekan ini. Kami di-upgrade ke apartemen. Ternyata apartemennya berjamur dan lembap, dan baunya tidak sedap. Kami tahu mereka baru buka kembali bulan Oktober. Kami dipindahkan ke kamar tepi pantai. Tidak ada peredam suara di kamar, dan pada malam hari, jalan utama Kuta berubah menjadi arena balap motor, sehingga hampir mustahil untuk tidur. Motor-motor diparkir di luar hotel dan mesinnya menyala. Berderak dan berisik. Sabtu malam saya keracunan makanan dari makanan yang diberikan di hotel, mungkin karena roti burger baratnya sudah dibekukan dan dicairkan karena tidak ada turis barat di sekitar. Saya tidak yakin, tapi itu satu-satunya makanan yang tidak dimakan pasangan saya. Kami menghubungi dokter yang menyatakan tidak bisa berkomentar, tapi kemungkinan besar disebabkan oleh sesuatu yang kami makan hari itu (burger). Staf hotel sangat ramah, tapi ini Pullman kedua yang kami inapi dan hotelnya juga biasa saja, mungkin ini masalah jaringan restoran. Kemungkinan besar tidak. Kami pasti akan kembali lagi."
"567.","Zoel Pancawardana","6","2023-01-21","1","Airnya sangat buruk, warnanya keruh dan kotor. Saya bahkan tidak bisa menggunakan bak mandi karena kualitas airnya yang buruk. Manajer mengatakan itu karena masalah pompa. Mereka memberi saya kamar baru tetapi masalahnya tidak teratasi. Saya masih tidak bisa mendapatkan air bersih di kamar mandi saya, jadi saya harus membatalkan beberapa rencana saya hari itu karena butuh waktu lama untuk menyelesaikannya. Perabotannya agak tua dan berkarat. Tidak banyak pilihan di menu sarapan, saya rasa itu karena Covid. Saya rasa saya tidak akan kembali ke sini."
"568.","Josh G","19","2023-01-21","1","Resepsionis memberi tahu kami bahwa biaya menginap kami belum dibayar, meskipun kami sudah menunjukkan dokumen pembayaran & laporan bank hotel. Mereka kemudian berkata, Anda bisa membatalkan pemesanan. Layanannya buruk sekali! Tidak direkomendasikan."
"569.","Budy Wuysang","375","2022-01-21","1","Sayangnya, ini akan menjadi kunjungan pertama dan terakhir saya ke hotel ini, memecahkan rekor ulasan terendah saya sepanjang masa. Sangat kecewa. Ini pertama kalinya saya menginap di suite HOTEL bintang 5 di BALI di mana BACON untuk sarapan hanya berdasarkan permintaan, ini normal untuk hotel di luar Bali, tetapi saya menganggapnya sangat aneh di Bali dengan standar bintang 5 :-(. Suite 3102 agak tua namun bersih & luas. Wifi di kamar TIDAK berfungsi, diperbaiki pada hari ke-2. Hanya 2 air minum kemasan, kulkas bersih dingin & dapat digunakan. Perlengkapan mandi kamar cukup baik. LCD 49 di ruang tamu dan 37 di kamar tidur. Stafnya baik & ramah KECUALI koki. Tidak ada staf/penjaga pantai di kolam renang lantai 3. Mengapa pengurangan bintang 4: 1. Bacon hanya berdasarkan permintaan (hari ke-1). 2. Permintaan bacon ditolak (hari ke-2), setelah menunggu oleh koki lain, malu Anda. 3. Roti panggang yang seharusnya dimakan dengan bacon terbuang sia-sia. 4. Wifi & minuman kemasan."

Itu hanya menambah kelembapan dan dingin. Kamarnya juga bau sekali. Aku tidak yakin apakah itu kamar mandinya atau AC-nya... Tidak semua hotel tua punya bau seperti ini, jadi aku tidak bisa bilang itu karena fasilitasnya yang ketinggalan zaman. Aku orang rumahan, jadi aku tidak bisa tinggal di rumah. ㅠㅠ"

Kami menyerah setelah kamar ke-12 dan mendapatkan Airbnb di dekatnya. Seprainya juga lembap. Stafnya membantu, tetapi mulai frustrasi karena kami terus meminta kamar baru. Jika Anda ingin tidur di kamar lembap berjamur dan terkena TBC, silakan nikmati waktu Anda di sini (dan selanjutnya di rumah sakit)."
"573.","Garth Musk","3","2019-01-21","1","Kemarin saya check in untuk menginap 10 malam di hotel terburuk yang pernah ada di Bali, dan menginap di lebih dari 20 hotel di area Legian/Kuta. Saya pernah menginap di hotel seharga $20 per malam di Bali yang jauh lebih baik daripada Pullmans Legian Hotel. Malam pertama, AC tidak mendinginkan kamar, AC menampilkan suhu kamar 26 derajat, saya menelepon resepsionis dan 2 petugas datang pukul 22.00, mencoba ventilasi selama 1 jam, lalu bilang akan pergi. Saya mengeluh kamar masih panas, lalu mereka mencoba lagi dan mengubah tampilan sehingga suhu kamar ditampilkan 23 derajat, dan mengatakan sensornya diganti? Kamar masih terlalu panas, jadi setelah 2 panggilan telepon lagi, kami dipindahkan pukul 01.00. Kamar baru ini terletak di belakang hotel. AC-nya berfungsi lebih baik, tetapi suara mesin dari atapnya tidak tertahankan. Saya sudah melihat cukup banyak hal dalam 14 jam pertama di hotel ini sehingga menyesal memesannya. Masih banyak hotel yang jauh lebih baik di area ini yang jauh lebih murah. Bantulah diri Anda sendiri dan hindari Pullmans Legian Hotel."

Kaki putriku sangat kotor setelah berjalan di lantai tanpa sandal.. Jangan pernah menginap di kamar yang dekat jalan raya, Tuhan tolong kamu berisik sekali.. Apa lagi ohh ya liftnya rusak, semoga beruntung jika kamu menginap di lantai 5.. Ahhaaa kutu busuk!!! Tidak tahu harus berkata apa lagi, ini sangat memalukan bagi Accor ternama atau reputasi Pullman lainnya.. Satu-satunya kelebihan dari hotel ini adalah Wi-Fi yang cukup kuat, staf yang ramah, dan pemandangan balkon..tapi hanya itu.. Pullman-nya kurang bagus..tarik kaus kakimu.."

Kamarnya sangat lembap sehingga saya merasa seperti berada di bawah air, dan meskipun AC sudah mendinginkan dan menghilangkan kelembapan, seprai tetap saja lembap. Saya bertanya kepada petugas hotel tentang bau apek yang menyengat, dan dia menjelaskan bahwa itu karena mereka sudah mendisinfeksi kamar. Apakah ini wajar untuk hotel bintang lima? Jika Anda mempertimbangkan penginapan murah, saya sangat menyarankan untuk tidak menginap di sini. Jika Anda sensitif terhadap seprai yang empuk, saya sangat menyarankan untuk tidak menginap di sini!"

"578.","Bruno Dmt","170","2024-01-21","1","Sebagai pelanggan tetap di hotel Accor, saya bisa meyakinkan Anda bahwa hotel ini benar-benar penipuan... Terlepas dari stafnya yang sangat sopan, penuh hormat, dan ceria yang selalu berusaha keras untuk memenuhi semua kebutuhan Anda, kondisi kamarnya sangat buruk: cerminnya retak, toilet bocor, pipa shower bocor di mana-mana, AC mengeluarkan suara yang sangat berisik, ada jejak kebocoran air di seluruh langit-langit (mereka mungkin perlu memasang ulang lapisan kedap airnya)... Apa yang bisa saya katakan tentang kamar Deluxe Ocean View? Lari, lari, lari... Tidak ada kaca ganda, berisik sekali, seolah-olah Anda tinggal di jalanan! Meskipun pemandangannya indah di siang hari, kebisingannya sangat mengganggu... Setelah menerima keluhan pukul 1 pagi, Anda diundang untuk pindah kamar dan di-upgrade ke suite dengan pemandangan taman tanpa kompensasi khusus selain check-out terlambat tanpa biaya tambahan... Wow, sungguh luar biasa!!! Terima kasih kepada manajemen hotel dan grup Accor atas tindakan luar biasa ini!!! Istri saya adalah mantan karyawan grup ini, dan saya senang dia memutuskan untuk pergi mencari tempat yang lebih baik... Bagaimanapun, hotel ini sama sekali tidak berstatus Pullman di kawasan Asia, kecuali (dan saya ulangi) kualitas dan keramahan stafnya yang menyelamatkannya... Saya rasa Anda telah kehilangan pelanggan tetap di hotel Anda. Saya akan menghabiskan uang saya di tempat lain, di hotel yang pelanggannya dilayani dengan jauh lebih baik... Jika Anda akan menanggapi komentar saya dengan sesuatu seperti kami menyesal masa inap Anda tidak berjalan dengan baik, tetapi kami sedang melakukan segala yang kami bisa untuk memuaskan pelanggan kami dengan melakukan renovasi..., tidak ada gunanya membalas! Saya tidak suka basa-basi... Sebuah nasihat bijak... PS: Pelanggan yang terhormat, segera pergi, Anda dapat menemukan pilihan yang lebih baik dan jauh lebih murah di sekitar sini, termasuk di dalam grup Accor."

"582.","Alicia ZF","1","2022-01-21","1","Ini adalah pengalaman menginap pertama dan terakhir saya di Pullman Legian Bali. Hotel ini mengambil handuk saya yang saya gantung di dinding, dan ketika saya melaporkan hal ini untuk mendapatkan handuk saya kembali, Pullman memperlakukan saya seperti pencuri, karena saya harus menandatangani formulir barang hilang & mereka mengusulkan untuk memanggil petugas keamanan untuk menggeledah kamar saya, untuk menemukan bukti. Saya, tamu yang kehilangan sesuatu, tetapi Pullman mengusulkan untuk memanggil petugas keamanan untuk menggeledah barang-barang saya di kamar saya?? Tidak masuk akal! Tamu adalah pihak yang kehilangan sesuatu, tetapi mereka membalikkan keadaan, mengusulkan untuk menggeledah kamar tamu. Pelayanan yang sangat mengecewakan, pelayanan yang buruk, sangat arogan. Masalah yang sama terjadi di Ibis/Pullman Grand Central Bandung, dalam beberapa jam mereka memberi tahu bahwa mereka telah menemukan handuk saya dan akan mengembalikannya kepada saya. Ibis/Pullman Bandung tidak memperlakukan saya sebaliknya. Tanggapan Pullman Legian mencerminkan bahwa mereka tidak pantas mendapatkan layanan perhotelan."

Kondisi keseluruhannya buruk, tetapi mereka tampaknya berusaha menutupinya dengan pencahayaan redup. 4. AC di kamar pertama kurang dingin, tetapi di kamar kedua, sekeras apa pun saya menyalakannya, tidak juga dingin. Saya mengeluh ke resepsionis selama dua hari. Katanya sudah diperbaiki, tapi ternyata tidak berhasil. Akhirnya, mereka harus membongkar seluruh AC dan menggantinya. Saya lupa berapa jam yang terbuang menunggu AC diganti dan membersihkan kamar. Bahkan saat saya menulis ulasan ini, kamarnya masih panas. Katanya sudah diperbaiki, tapi apa yang mereka perbaiki? 5. Letaknya di tengah jalan satu arah, jadi agak berantakan.

Meskipun membayar untuk kamar dengan pemandangan laut, deru konstan dari jalan raya membuat saya tidak bisa menikmati kamar. Layanan Sarapan: Bagian terburuk dari pengalaman ini adalah layanan yang kaku dan acuh tak acuh selama sarapan. Tepat pukul 10:30 pagi, staf langsung mulai membersihkan semuanya, tanpa memperhatikan tamu yang masih duduk dan makan. Tidak ada fleksibilitas atau keramahan yang ditunjukkan. Dengan harga yang mereka tetapkan, kurangnya perawatan dan budaya layanan yang buruk tidak dapat diterima.

Alhasil saya pun komplain dan pihak Pullman memberikan solusi akan set up saat breakfast.. Saat breakfast pun tiba, sampai selesai breakfast tidak ada setup apapun mengenai request saya.. Sangat di sayangkan pelayanan di hotel sekelas Pullman seperti itu tidak mengindahkan permintaan customer yang saya rasa bukan hal yang sulit untuk di siapkan Saat check out pihak Pullman memberikan kami bingkisan slice cake dan meminta maaf Sebagai member Accor yang memilih hotel Pullman di bandingkan dengan hotel lainnya yaa kecewa.. Semoga Pullman bisa memperbaiki pelayanan kepada customer walau itu hal yang sangat kecil tapi itu sangat berharga untuk customer.."

Ruangan breakfast bnyk lalat hijau. Makan pun jdi waswas. Pas mau ambil roti lalat hijau dgn asyik sedang menikmati roti. Pas panggil staff srh ganti malah yg dilalerin dibawa ikut masuk. Mana tau itu diganti/tidak 😩😰. Sekelas pullman butter pun dicetak sendiri bukan pk butter kemasan minisize & selai kemasan minisize setidaknya lebih hygiene. Overall breakfast sangat mengecewakan apalagi dgn perlakuan staff bagian breakfast bikin tambah kecewa."

Kami sudah mengabari H-1 bahwa akan telat check-in & sudah menyebutkan perkiraan jam kedatangan. Pihak hotel juga sudah mengonfirmasi. Tapi begitu proses check-in di lobi, semua kamar yang kami pesan ternyata belum disiapkan sama sekali. Kami sampai harus menunggu sekitar 1 jam untuk bisa masuk kamar. Kurang menghargai waktu orang. • Tidak bisa menitipkan makanan yang kita pesan di luar, ke resepsionis. Kalau laundry atau barang lainnya, masih bisa. • Kawasan padat karena berseberangan langsung dengan Pantai Kuta. Suasananya ramai & kurang nyaman untuk bersantai tenang. Ketika malam, kadang ada kumpulan WNA yang lewat pakai mobil dan menyalakan musik keras-keras. • Peralatan fasilitas kamar & toiletries lengkap. Ada papan setrika, pengering rambut, sikat sepatu, dll. • Menu sarapan sangat variatif. Ada masakan dari India, Rusia, Jepang, China, Arab, dll. • Ada 2 kolam renang: di lantai 1 & 3."

Hanya Pasta Station yang menurut kami cukup baik. Dan untuk sirkulasi restaurant yg berAC bisa dikatakan cukup panas, karena saya membawa bayi dan bayi tidak betah dan kepanasan. Serta untuk dinner mgkn dikemudian hari disediakn free minuman, bukan additional water. Karena untuk sekelas Pullman rasanya kurang pas harus dikenakan additional, dibanding Pullman2 di cabang yang lain. Semoga Pullman Legian Bali, bisa meningkatkan service dan quality dari makanan di restaurant baik dr kebersihan, pelayanan staff, dan ambience dari restaurant."

"662.","Peter Nielsen","14","2025-12-31","2","Pullman Legian memiliki lokasi yang bagus dan kamar-kamar yang nyaman, yang sekilas tampak seperti pilihan yang menarik. Namun kenyataannya, hotel ini mengecewakan karena kurangnya perhatian terhadap detail dan manajemen yang terasa tidak terorganisir. Semuanya memakan waktu terlalu lama dan hotel terasa selalu kewalahan dan penuh sesak. Pengalaman check-in sangat buruk, kami tiba tepat sebelum waktu check-in pukul 15.00 tetapi kamar belum siap selama lebih dari satu jam. Kurangnya kendali ini berlanjut sepanjang masa menginap, dengan banyak kegagalan kecil namun konstan yang dengan cepat menumpuk. Kamar itu sendiri sangat bagus dan lokasinya sangat baik. Makanan juga sangat enak, dan stafnya ramah. Namun, keramahan saja tidak cukup untuk menutupi kurangnya organisasi yang baik. Manajemen jelas belum membawa tempat ini ke standar yang Anda harapkan dari hotel bermerek Pullman dan dengan harga yang Anda bayar! Properti ini memiliki potensi, tetapi saat ini terasa kacau, dan jauh dari memberikan nilai yang sepadan dengan uang yang dikeluarkan, dan itu adalah hal yang sangat penting di Bali….Saya sangat menyarankan untuk menginap di tempat lain."
"663.","dhruv jaggi","13","2025-10-21","2","Saya baru-baru ini menginap di Pullman Bali dan memberi nilai keseluruhan pengalaman saya sekitar 2,5 dari 5. Stafnya sungguh luar biasa — sopan, penuh perhatian, dan selalu siap membantu. Saya khususnya ingin menyebutkan Bapak Dodi, yang profesional dan ramah selama interaksi kami, dan Bapak Frans, yang merespons dengan cepat ketika ada masalah dengan kamar kami. Saat sarapan, Haity dan Dep sama-sama luar biasa — selalu hangat, ceria, dan sangat perhatian. Layanan mereka yang ramah membuat pagi hari terasa menyenangkan. Namun, kamar-kamarnya terasa agak kuno dan perlu direnovasi. Kami juga mencium bau menyengat di kamar pertama kami, yang membutuhkan perubahan. Meskipun tim menanganinya secara efisien, hal itu mengecewakan untuk properti sekelas Pullman. Meskipun keramahannya sangat baik, layanan, fasilitas, dan kualitas kamar tidak memenuhi standar yang sama seperti yang diharapkan dari hotel bermerek Pullman. Dengan beberapa renovasi dan layanan & pemeliharaan yang lebih baik, hotel ini berpotensi menawarkan pengalaman yang jauh lebih baik."

Yang lebih buruk lagi adalah saat saya melakukan pembayaran. Aktivitasnya benar-benar mimpi buruk. Dan Accor membiarkan tempat ini berada di lobi hotel Anda?"
"665.","Nicole Hooper","1","2026-01-14","2","Kami menginap di Pullman Bali Legian Beach sebagai rombongan keluarga. Meskipun ada beberapa hal positif, pengalaman kami sayangnya dibayangi oleh kekhawatiran serius mengenai kolam renang dan bagaimana situasi tersebut ditangani. Di sisi positif, kamar luas dan sangat nyaman, staf klub anak-anak sangat ramah terhadap anak-anak, dan sarapan menawarkan berbagai pilihan yang baik. Kami juga menikmati beberapa pijat yang luar biasa di spa. Namun, tak lama setelah berenang, 7 dari 8 anak dalam rombongan kami mengalami ruam dan gejala seperti luka bakar, yang konsisten dengan iritasi kimia. Orang dewasa juga mengalami ketidaknyamanan, termasuk rasa sakit yang luar biasa saat membuka mata di bawah air. (Kami adalah perenang reguler dan belum pernah merasakan mata kami terbakar seperti ini.) Akibatnya, anak-anak kami menolak untuk menggunakan kolam renang selama sisa masa menginap kami, yang sangat mengecewakan untuk resor yang berfokus pada keluarga. Kami membayar untuk menggunakan kolam renang di Mandira dan Padma di mana anak-anak kami semua dengan senang hati berenang tanpa iritasi. Kami berulang kali meminta untuk berbicara dengan manajemen hotel, tetapi manajemen senior tidak tersedia, dan kami malah berurusan dengan manajer yang bertugas selama lebih dari seminggu. Kami diberitahu bahwa hanya kadar klorin, pH, dan alkalinitas yang diuji di dalam hotel, dengan pengujian laboratorium lengkap hanya dilakukan setiap enam bulan sekali. Mengingat banyaknya anak yang terkena dampak, kami yakin pengujian lebih lanjut seharusnya dilakukan segera. Sepanjang proses, kekhawatiran kami seringkali diabaikan, dengan saran bahwa anak-anak kami memiliki kulit sensitif atau bahwa reaksi bervariasi — meskipun keluarga lain di hotel juga melaporkan masalah serupa pada anak-anak mereka. Kami berbicara dengan 3 keluarga lain yang anak-anaknya juga mengalami ruam. Staf klub anak-anak memberitahukan hal ini kepada manajer yang bertugas karena 2 anak yang bukan bagian dari kelompok kami juga mengeluh tentang ruam di tubuh mereka. Foto hasil pengujian air kolam renang baru diberikan lebih dari seminggu setelah dijanjikan, dan menunjukkan kadar klorin yang tinggi yang tidak berada dalam kisaran ideal, bertentangan dengan jaminan sebelumnya. Karena khawatir terhadap tamu lain, kami berencana untuk mengatur pengujian air independen sendiri, namun sayangnya botol sampel tertinggal di kendaraan transfer saat perjalanan ke hotel kami berikutnya. Meskipun hotel menawarkan transportasi gratis ke hotel kami berikutnya sebagai bentuk itikad baik, hal ini tidak dapat menggantikan penderitaan yang ditimbulkan atau hilangnya penggunaan fasilitas kolam renang. Perlu dicatat juga bahwa anak-anak kami rutin berenang di rumah dan kami menginap di 2 hotel lain setelah Pullman di mana tidak ada yang mengalami ruam atau luka bakar. Kami tidak akan menginap di sini lagi, karena kekhawatiran kami tidak ditanggapi dengan serius setelah banyak diskusi dan berulang kali diabaikan, terutama mengingat implikasi kesehatan dan keselamatan bagi anak-anak."

Bau di kamar sudah sering disebutkan oleh banyak orang, dan ini masalah serius. Salah satu dari tiga kamar kami harus pindah kamar, tetapi kamar sebelahnya pun masih berbau. Pelayanannya luar biasa, dan mereka memang menambahkan bonus untuk membuat masa inap kami lebih menyenangkan. Namun, ulasan tentang bau di kamar sudah ada sejak lama, dan jika mereka tidak akan melakukan apa pun untuk mengatasinya, Anda perlu mengetahuinya sebelum memutuskan untuk menginap di sini.

Mereka menawarkan kamar sementara untuk kami dan juga voucher minuman gratis di bar. Hal ini baik-baik saja bagi kami, tetapi karena kami ada rapat dengan teman pukul 18.00, jadi kami harus bersiap-siap. Saya pikir kamar akan siap dalam satu jam sesuai janji mereka. Namun, kami menunggu hingga pukul 17.00 dan masih belum ada informasi tentang kamar kami! Setelah menelepon 2 kali, yang pertama tidak memberikan informasi yang membantu. Setelah itu, kami diantar ke kamar kami yang bau pemutih di seluruh ruangan! Jadi saya tidak punya cukup waktu untuk bersantai atau bahkan bersantai di kolam renang :( Saya sudah dua kali meminta 2 sandal tambahan, tetapi tidak diberikan. Jadi, saya langsung meninggalkan hotel untuk janji temu saya di luar daripada menunggu. Entah apa yang terjadi dengan layanannya.

Kamar-kamarnya dalam kondisi yang sangat buruk, kotor, ketinggalan zaman, dan berbau apek yang kuat akibat jamur dan kelembapan. Dinding dan perabotan tampak usang, dan kamar mandinya terasa tidak terawat. Yang paling mengejutkan saya adalah kondisi handuk dan seprai: baunya tidak sedap, ada noda yang terlihat, dan sejujurnya membuat saya bertanya-tanya apakah sudah dicuci dengan benar. Rasanya tidak higienis dan tidak nyaman. Meskipun prasmanan sarapannya benar-benar luar biasa, dengan banyak pilihan yang segar dan lezat, dan stafnya ramah dan benar-benar berusaha sebaik mungkin, itu saja tidak dapat menutupi betapa buruknya kualitas kamar.

Saat check-in di malam hari, dalam waktu 1 jam saya membuat keluhan ke resepsionis mengenai air panas yang tidak panas dan menanyakan apakah saya bisa pindah kamar atau tidak. Mereka menyarankan saya untuk mengirim teknisi ke atas. Teknisi yang tidak profesional hanya memeriksa pancuran air panas memang tidak panas dan hanya mengatakan kepada saya bahwa itu cukup normal karena banyak orang yang menggunakannya. Tunggu lagi besok pagi dan lihat bagaimana hasilnya. Resolusi untuk hotel bintang 5 dan pullman bermerek yang tidak saya duga…. Pada malam hari, kamar saya khususnya memiliki suara mesin setiap 30 menit, meskipun tidak keras tetapi selalu membangunkan pasangan saya. Pagi sebelum sarapan, saya memberi tahu resepsionis di lantai bawah bahwa saya ingin pindah kamar. Saya secara khusus memberi tahu mereka beberapa tahun yang lalu bahwa saya tinggal di kamar lantai dasar dan semuanya baik-baik saja sehingga akan senang untuk pindah ke sana. Sambil menikmati sarapan, manajer hotel dengan ramah memperkenalkan dirinya dan bertanya bagaimana pengalaman menginap sejauh ini, dan saya menjelaskan kepadanya. Selesai sarapan kembali ke resepsionis dan bertemu dengannya saat dia menugaskan 1 rekannya untuk membawa saya ke kamar. Kamar baru baik-baik saja, air panasnya panas tetapi bukan kamar lantai dasar yang saya harapkan. Saya menepisnya karena saya sedang terburu-buru untuk melakukan aktivitas harian saya. Mereka menempatkan saya di kamar deluxe dengan pemandangan laut yang ternyata menjadi masalah lain di malam hari… tidur gelisah. Saat cuaca Bali memburuk, hujan deras dan angin kencang, angin panas akan merembes masuk melalui pintu balkon yang bahkan tidak tertutup rapat. Saya pikir untuk properti bintang 5, mendapatkan pintu balkon yang tertutup rapat tidaklah sulit. Sangat menjengkelkan dan pintunya menjadi sangat berisik, sebenarnya sangat berisik. Pada tengah malam saat hujan semakin deras, air hujan bahkan merembes masuk melalui pintu dan membuat lantai saya banjir, di dalam kamar saya sendiri… repot untuk mengeluh/pindah kamar, hanya mencoba yang terbaik untuk tidur. Check-out paling lambat diminta, yang hanya bisa sampai jam 3 sore, satu-satunya hal yang baik selama saya menginap."

Sayangnya, kamarnya tidak memenuhi harapan saya. Masalah terbesarnya adalah AC yang terus mati otomatis sekitar pukul 2-3 pagi setiap malam. Meskipun sudah memeriksa remote dan memastikan tidak ada timer yang disetel, masalah tetap ada, sehingga sulit untuk tidur nyenyak. Mengingat ketidaknyamanan dan kurangnya solusi, kami memutuskan untuk pindah ke hotel lain setelah menginap dua malam.

Lebih parah lagi, masalah yang saya laporkan kepada staf hotel beberapa kali tidak ditangani. Kepala pancuran rusak, wastafel terisi air, salah satu lampu tidak berfungsi, dan pintunya rusak. Dan tidak ada yang menangani masalah ini. Kami mengeluh beberapa kali. Meskipun telah menyampaikan masalah ini kepada mereka, hanya ada sedikit upaya untuk memperbaikinya.
