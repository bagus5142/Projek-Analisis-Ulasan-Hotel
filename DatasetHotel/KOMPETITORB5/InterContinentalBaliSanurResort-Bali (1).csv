"1.","Kris Maree","72","2025-12-26","1","Unfortunately have to give a 1 star rating due to a very serious issue. On the second night of our stay, 19/12/2025, my partner and I attended the Nayala beach club where we both had a few drinks and some food. Within an hour, I started to feel extremely unwell and ended up requiring a doctor to attend our suite. It was discovered that I had methanol poisoning which can result in death if left untreated. Thankfully the doctor was able to reverse the poisoning and I am now doing ok although I am still struggling to keep food down and am still experiencing dizziness, abdominal discomfort and nausea. When we informed a staff member and then a manager, all we were told is “oh we are sorry” we then tried to escalate this to IHG and received the same response. UNACCEPTABLE! You have had a hotel patron pay an expensive amount for a suite and high costs for beverages and food at your hotel that has caused quite a serious, potentially fatal, illness and all that can be said is “sorry”? No! Other than that the location is beautiful, staff are very nice and helpful and the suite was nice. Although, be warned about the food as it’s often not fully cooked and there was a few issues in the suite with it seeming quite outdated, couldn’t watch tv or connect phones for Netflix etc. will not be returning to any IHG resorts or hotels. We thought that a 5 star rating hotel would have a higher standard. We do wish to say thank you to Reni at the spa who was lovely. Do better IHG. Legal advice is currently being sought as to our options."

Plenty of choice , the fresh juice was excellent. The service team were efficient and friendly without being in your face all the time. A good experience we will be back !"
"3.","Rowan","6","2025-12-25","5","As expected of the flagship hotel of the IHG brand, Intercontinental Bali Sanur was a beautiful luxurious resort to enjoy a segment of our relaxing vacation. My partner and I are Balinese and Australian respectively, and through our combined set of standards we would definetly stay again if we happen to be around Sanur. Looking forward to seeing the renovated reception/lobby when we do return 🙏"
"4.","Nikolay G","59","2025-12-01","5","Great hotel for couples. Staff was friendly, rooms were spacious and the breakfast was quite tasty. Location is great and we particularly liked the small (kiddy) pools to enjoy in the hot days with great ambience. Location is also great to jog on the beach alley or welcome the sunrise early in the morning. Quite close to Sanur port too. Their Pier Eight restaurant however is lacklustre. Cocktails were not well made (e.g. mojito was lacking crushed ice and sugar)."
"5.","Ruksana Azim","52","2025-08-01","5","Everything about the place was perfect, from the rooms to the food but especially the service. The staff are always smiling and so friendly. The villas were exceptional value. They were huge, clean and had a great size private pool. I would highly recommend staying here and look forward to coming back again."
"6.","Nirmani Widanage","9","2025-11-01","4","We loved the spacious and clean rooms. The staff were very friendly and always went above and beyond to help. However, breakfast could be improved. There wasn’t much variety or local cuisine offered. This hotel may not be ideal for families with kids. The kids club was quite disappointing, the staff were unfriendly and unengaging, and there wasn’t much for the children to do. The kids’ pool was also very basic with no fun features or activities. Overall, great rooms and service, but not family-friendly."
"7.","Andy Barker","40","2025-08-01","5","We loved our time at IC Sanur. We were welcomed with cold towels, refreshments, and warm smiles. We had connecting rooms for our family of five. The rooms were very spacious with huge lanais overlooking the inner courtyard area. The staff even had a small birthday cake for our youngest son in the refrigerator. The breakfast buffet was a big plus as well. Many delicious options of various types of food. We look forward to our next stay!"
"8.","Yulia R","4","2025-08-01","2","Disappointing stay. Our pool villa was run down and far away from the beach and pool/restaurant so we had to walk for a long time. You can call for a buggy to pick you up but it was inconvenient. Two level boring villa, all views were to see other villas around you. Didn't have any furniture by the pool to sit on apart from one round lounger that didn't even had a cushion to sit on so we asked for a cushion on arrival. It was very uncomfortable so we didnt use it. Walls around the pool were covered in green and black mould. Cleaning standard wasn't great, we had splashes of purple shampoo on shower walls from previous visitors. Water was pouring our of the shower on the floor into the bathroom as it wasn't draining well. Our booking was including breakfast, afternoon tea and afternoon cocktails. When we arrived for our free afternoon tea we were told that there was a mistake in our booking and they won't provide it. After a conversation with a duty manager and our request for a full refund of our 5 nights stay, they provided afternoon tea to us but also charged for it in the final bill so we had to have another conversation. Received a fruit plate on arrival but sadly half of it was rotten. A plate with cakes was nice. Asked for a late check out to 2pm and they gave it us but our swipe cards didn't work when we arrived to our villa at 1.30pm. We only had half an hour to pack and get ready but wasted 10min walking back to reception and catching a buggy back to villa with activated swipe card. Beach at the front of the hotel isn't nice due to a large number of boats in that particular side of the beach and seaweed so you have to walk to another beach to swim. Breakfast at Layang Layand was nice but Pier Eight restaurant was average. They also don't have enough loungers by the pool for a big hotel like this."
"9.","Maharanindita","6","2025-10-01","1","saya mendapatkan late check out sampai dengan jam 2 siang. Betapa terkejutnya ketika seorang staff pria langsung masuk ke dalam kamar untuk mengecek mini bar dengan master key tanpa permisi mengetuk pintu ataupun adanya telp pemberitahuan dari front office sebelumnya. Sangat kecewa untuk pelayanan hotel bintang 5. Bagaimana bisa seorang staff masuk ke dalam kamar tamu tanpa permisi sebelumnya dengan master key, padahal tamunya jelas belum check out & belum mengembalikan kunci?? Langsung masuk ke dalam kamar tamu tanpa permisi dengan master key sangat amat tidak sopan."
"10.","Adi Joshi","65","2025-08-01","4","The villa is so spacious and beautiful. I do understand what people say about a musty smell but its an old room and could be overlooked. If the room wasn't so old it wouldn't have so much space. Hotel was very clean. Breakfast was delicious, try their pancakes!! The beach wasn't super clean/swimmable but great view. Very walkable as well to other spots and very kid friendly."
"11.","Hira Dzira","5","2025-07-01","5","Great experience in this hotel! The staff were all friendly, and the welcome drinks were also great. My friends and I are a party of four, so we got a two bedroom villa with a garden view and a private pool. The villa was two floors, and to my recollection it was 310m^2. It was an amazing experience. Breakfast was included in our stay, and it was great if you're more inclined to a Western diet. I personally prefer an Asian diet, but the food still tasted great. We had complimentary gym access 24/7 and also a free flow happy hour during 5-7PM. I couldn't recommend this hotel enough. When we were checking out, the staff members also made sure we didn't leave anything behind. We also traveled back and forth from the villa to the resort's lobby via buggy. Fun ride! The villa included a kitchen, dining area and a living room which you can connect bluetooth with ;) I was also pretty loud at our villa but no complaints. We also had a sunbed, and it was perfectly aligned with where the sun shined. Great stay, couldn't recommend it enough."
"12.","Isabella Rossi","1","2025-10-01","2","Pasilitas lumayan, Namun Security yang pakai baju biru,rambutnya naik kayak janggar ayam.Sangat tidak mencerminkan sosok Security, parahnya lagi kata-katanya agak cabul.Selama menginap di sini,saya merasa kurang aman.Caranya dia membantu saya, terkesan sok berkuasa.Securitynya ini kayak preman pasar,tidak ada tampang aman atau nyaman. Malah bikin saya gak nyaman dan kata katanya agak menusuk.Intinya saya bayar mahal disini harusnya dapat pelayanan yang sesuai bukan seperti ini. Saat malam ada suara ribut-ribut,bukanya di tindak tegas,dan malah saya yang di suruh sabar.Pantainya banyak lumut,saya lihat security-nya melamun gak jelas.Saat situasi urgent security-nya yang baju biru asik sekali duduk sambil main hp. Saya berharap hotel ini supaya management nya di perbaiki terutama security-nya.Dengan biaya hotel yang mahal,saya minta tolong cek cctv malah ngaku nggak bisa playback emang security makan gajih buta. Dari segi pakaian sudah tidak mencerminkan sebagai petugas keamanan yang tertib,symbol pelatihan keamanan nggak ada.Jangan-jangan security abal-abal masuk lewat orang dalam.Kepolisian kurang tegas dalam melaksanakan pengawasan, penting untuk kedepannya tingkah laku dan perbuatan security-nya secara tidak langsung akan merusak nama baik hotel dan sekitarnya.Penting untuk melaksanakan pembinaan terutama bagian SDM atau HRD supaya tidak asal asalan memilih orang efek nya tidak sekarang tapi kedepannya"
"13.","Saleh alsumait","6","2025-07-01","1","A Very Disappointing Stay – Doesn’t Deserve 5 Stars I stayed in a suite, and this was honestly one of my worst hotel experiences — definitely not up to the InterContinental standard. • Broken AC: The air conditioning was completely out of service. They provided multiple standing fans instead, turning the room into an electronics shop. The humidity was unbearable — it literally felt like a sauna near the bed. Even the in-room snacks turned soft and soggy from the damp air, almost like dough. • Poor Sound Insulation: At night, I could hear wind whistling through the balcony door, footsteps from the floor above, and constant water pipe noises that made it hard to sleep. • Room Dining: The food was far below average and did not reflect 5-star quality in any way. ⸻ 🚫 Bottom Line: The hotel is very outdated and not worthy of its 5-star rating — 3 stars at best. It was a terrible experience, and the only compensation offered was a cheap chocolate cake worth no more than $4. This property seriously damages the InterContinental brand and should be removed from the group altogether."
"14.","Andrew Katers","36","2025-08-01","3","What a disappointment after staying at Intercontinental Jimbaran. From White Lotus vibes to White Castle vibes! The location is very good and Pier 8 restaurant and staff are the highlights. As for the rest, here goes: As for our room, our bed linen wasn't changed at all. There was some blood on our sheets and comforter cover (small amount) due to an injury and instead of changing the sheets, the bed was simply made and not changed. Secondly, we used some mini fridge items and these weren't replaced. There was also hair found on the shower floor that wasn't cleaned up, indicating the shower itself wasn't cleaned. Lastly, we used glasses from the room and these were just left in the room unwashed and un changed. Having breakfast in the dining room as like being in childcare hell. Screaming kids, sub par food & rude guests who just love to cut in was the norm for each day there. Lastly, the check out process took nearly 30 minutes (don't be in a rush to get to the airport). Even then, I ended up getting a phone call from the front desk whilst in the cab to the airport saying they had forgotten something that required my signature. I found this to be a totally unacceptable level of service from what purports to be a 5 star resort. Next time I'll be staying at the Hyatt Regency nearby."
"15.","Bella J Food & Travel","125","2025-05-01","5","This is a great hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. The rooms are a fantastic size. We booked a suite which is around 130 sqm. Breakfast is great and I feel they really ensure their is not too much waste created by having live stations and a la carte orders. The pool is a 50 m one and raised to oversee the promenade and ocean. You get a lovely breeze without having passerby looking at you which happens at the other hotels down the road."
"16.","Jo Tan","24","2025-07-01","3","Did not feel like this property lived up to Inter-Con and 5 star standard. Place is kind of old, and rooms had a faint old woodish smell that was not so pleasant. Sheets and pillows also were thin and had a smell. Phone in the room was faulty, asked for follow up but there was none. Gym water dispenser ran out of water. Teams were friendly, but lacking a thoughtfulness on services."
"17.","Bali Home","2","2025-09-01","5","Beautiful scenery, very friendly staff. Love the ambiance. Beach is only walking distance. While you waiting in lobby, you will be serenade by live traditional Balinese gamelan, synchronize with gentle breeze. One of the best hotel in Sanur.

"18.","Kiana Tabakova","27","2025-07-01","2","I will start with the good things - the grounds are amazing and the rooms are spacious and beautiful. But the maintenance is not so good. In our room we had this impressive bathtub, only to discover that all the water from it leaks right away on the floor. And the hotel couldn’t do anything to fix it. The housekeeping was forgetting to put new towels and robes (while taking the old ones). Out of three days we were there, one day the pool and the bar next to it were closed for guests because of the wedding, we were not expecting this and would booked another hotel if we knew that. Also technically it was closed only from 3pm, starting from 8-30 am the entrance to the pool was blocked by the decorations that the staff was cutting and drilling and painting with smelly paint. The sea is not really swimmable, so pool access is a really big deal. On the next day another wedding was taking place, and while they didn’t rented the pool, there was hardly a place in the hotel where you couldn’t hear the MC and the music. The spa is a complete scam, as the person doing manicure has absolutely no experience - overpainted and underpainted nails, mushy polish that doesn’t dry, had to come back to remove the polish i paid 500K for few hours later. In the essence, it was once a wonderful place, but if you expect 5star service, go somewhere else."
"19.","Simon kerr","3","2025-07-01","2","I find it hard to believe I’m staying in an intercontinental hotel. Compared to the many other intercon properties I have stayed at this is an extremely poor representation of the brand. I assumed it must have been a rebranded property but upon enquiring I was told it has always been an intercontinental hotel. The build is very poor quality. The service was somehow the most disinterested I have experienced in Bali and that was across the property. Most of the menu items I tried to order were unavailable, the breakfast restaurant was good (probably the only aspect of the property at intercontinental standard) however the offering was very small. The pool bar and pool area is 3* at best. Decking is dilapidated and the grounds are underwhelming. Several of the bathrooms were flooded, around both vanity’s and toilets. Having come from intercontinental Bali resort jimbaran the difference is night & day. We ate at pier 8 and to say it was underwhelming is to be polite. Under cooked / raw seafood, undercooked steak, woefull desserts. I just can’t stop repeating that I can’t understand how this is an 5* intercontinental hotel."
"20.","Aleksandr Han","21","2025-05-01","5","Great hotel! Spacious, bright rooms with a cozy atmosphere - you can feel that everything is thought out to the smallest detail. Very tasty breakfasts! The staff is incredibly helpful and always ready to help, it feels like you’re at home, not just in a hotel. The location is also good - the beach is within easy reach. The atmosphere is very calm and relaxing, ideal for both recreation. Perhaps the best accommodation option in Sanur, definitely!"
"21.","Stuart Hinds","10","2025-08-01","5","This was the second business workshop I have run at the Intercontinental Sanur Bali , it was again exceptional venue , the staff were incredible, such a pleasure to deal with ! The gold star goes to Feggy who I dealt with for the second time and she is a pure joy to deal with and an incredible person, she was looking after all my needs as well as juggling a Wedding at the same time , which the weather was being a pain! She was unbelievable and just so calm and hilarious, I can highly recommend the IC Sanur and you have to use Feggy. I hope the IC realize how much of an asset she truly is ! Back next year! Btw the food was divine Stuart"
"22.","Zinky Zinky","26","2025-07-01","5","Great rooms, great service. Great pool, great staff. Breakfast is amazing. Be prepared to walk quite a distance to the pool from your room. Great view but Sanur beach is filthy, alot of rubbish which is quite disappointing. Our first day here , we wanted the pool, but alas , a wedding was taking place , sooo pool was out of bounds. We were quite annoyed as this is what we want to do on our holiday ( swim and sunbake)Thus thought we'd go to beach , sun-baked and swim. But was too disgusting."
"23.","james kana","4","2025-08-01","1","Hotel location is at the edge of sanur beach. Not the best. Building needs major renovations, aging and doesnt have the 5 stars needs. No club house, limited space/layout. Villa section is more like abandoned housing complex that turned into 'villa'. Garden conditions just aging and in a mess. They need more staff and major renovation. I give one star for the service of the Balinese staff that working hard for this hotel. Intercontinental known for their quality and im wondering why this hotel, facilities, building conditions still rated as 5 star intercontinental hotel. Owner and top management should understand that intercontinental has a better standard. Look closer:intercontinental jimbaran, they are at their best. Thank you staff but the owner needs to do something for 5 star hotel."
"24.","Emma","4","2025-04-01","5","The Hotel was a very lovely end to our beautiful Bali holiday. Many times in Bali, First time in Sanur =Wow! Start off with the room- absolutely breathtaking views , very large and room for little man to stretch his legs. Large bath tub! comfy bed! Dining over the duration of our stay was a huge highlight! The menu in all restaurants had plenty of options. Both dinner services, not only did the staff check in how our meals were, amazing service, the chef also came to greet us, checking if we were satisfied! Thank you Ben!! More than satisfied. Travelling with a toddler- menu options for the kids(nuggets and the rest) had plenty of options. This one is for families travelling with babies-- 2 pureed options!! Big tick! This should be available at all hotels for those travelling with young ones. I wish we had these options travelling when little man was younger . Only downside is the pool area has one big pool and 2 smaller pools- more shade would be nice and maybe perhaps in the near future- kids pool with a slide or 2 😉 cocktails and happy hours tho always a big tick! Kids Club is absolutely 5 stars. Mine didn't want to leave the entire day- the staff were amazing! Thank you !!"
"25.","Ellen Brigitta","1141","2025-06-01","3","I'm a bit disappointed with the room. I went here when it's still Fairmont and i was impressed with luxurious and spacious room. I expected the same since the price of the room is > IDR 4mio. However quite surprised to see the quality is not the same. The room layout is still the same but it really needs a refurbishment! The sanitary wears are not shining, full of waterstains. The shower is not in perfect condition, and it took so long until the water getting warm (and not even hot). The kettle looks cheap and they dont even have a proper coffee machine nor good coffee sachets. There was unpleasanr smells came from the aircon. But the staff and operational manager handled the complaint properly and moved me to another room (which still have problem with the water not getting hot). But i do appreciate the staff response and apologized sincerely. They even extended my check out to 4PM. The breakfast quality is still good though. Advice to the management to pay attention to the details and cleanliness as it's a 5 stars hotel, they need to provide proper amenities and facilities to match the 5 stars claim."
"26.","Kumar Sivan","276","2025-02-01","4","Location Great location on Sanur beach. View of the ocean from the swimming pool. Walkway along the ocean with several establishments. Short walk into town with a variety of restaurants, massage parlors, laundry service, markets etc. Service The staff were always respectful and eager to help. Service was great. While we were in the Lobby restaurant enjoying a welcome drink and Cocktails, the Manager (Mauro) stopped by our table and visited with us. He shared a bit about his background and the plans he has for the property. That was a rather nice personal touch and it was obvious that he cared to provide good service and visit with the guests to check in on how things are going. Room Got upgraded to a suite (garden view) that was rather nice. The room was bigger than most apartments! The bathroom was very spacious with 2 sinks, a full sized bathtub and a shower. There was a huge balcony with a couple of ceiling fans that provided an outside area where one can spend evenings playing cards and such activities. The room itself was quite spacious with a King size bed. The only complaint would be that it was hard to get the temperature right in the room. But overall, the room and upgrade were fabulous! Lobby restaurant This is the only place we ate. There is a beach side restaurant as another choice but we did not eat there. We had breakfast most mornings at this one. Practically every item we ordered off the menu was exceptional both in presentation and taste. Overall high marks for the quality of food. There is a grand Piano at this restaurant and on the Friday night, not long after we arrived there, there was an Artiste playing the Piano and it was simply fabulous. The ambiance, the food, the music all made for a most enjoyable evening. As wonderful as the Piano was, at other times, little kids constantly kept going up to the Piano and playing on it. This was quite annoying and the staff should have been more insistent that parents do not let their kids take over the Piano without permission. Even after we complained to the staff they seemed reluctant to keep the kids away from the Piano. There is a restaurant directly below the lobby that was being renovated. There was constant noise of construction from this place and quite often a nuisance when one is trying to enjoy a meal. It was impossible to find a time when it was mostly quiet without construction noise. Swimming Pool Spent considerable amount of time at the pool. The pool is quite large and ideal. Plenty of seating around the pool and staff that are eager to help with food or drink orders. Fabulous ocean view from the pool and it is easy to spend hours there without noticing! Fitness Room Used the fitness room several times. There are 3 Treadmills. For the entire stay, 2 out of 3 Treadmills had a 'Maintenance sticker' on it and was not functional. Obviously the hotel did not care to be prompt about repairing broken equipment. Something that is so commonly used as a Treadmill that sits around without being maintained for days is inexcusable."
"27.","Fiona Walker","16","2025-04-01","5","We recently stayed at the Intercontinental Hotel, Sanur for 6 nights which was magnificent. The room was incredible, the pool area stunning, the service perfect, and the pool area to die for. The 40m blue infinity pool looking out to the sea was lovely to lounge around and gave us the opportunity for great swims - well, before the unfortunate accident, anyway. The room was so luxurious with a huge bathroom, a big bedroom with a super comfortable bed and pillows, and the biggest, loveliest balcony which was really an al fresco room looking out to the gardens and beyond to the sea. This was especially appreciated after the unfortunate accident. Breakfast at the Layang Layang Restaurant was superb. Lavish, high quality buffet but also a la carte off a creative menu if you liked. Unbelievable everything - just the variety of expensive French cheese was enough to reel me in but the choice was excellent, including a very authentic Indonesian corner, and the gorgeous, classy restaurant was run really well by Andrini. Please see attached video! The three course delicious meal in the hotel’s beach restaurant attended by Ima was fantastic and the two 60 minute massages at the exclusive and posh spa were the same. I actually cried because I felt so cared for. But the Travel Moment of the trip was the ‘sunrise boat breakfast’. We went down to the beach at 5.30am in the dark and hopped into one of the little, local, coloured boats that look like spiders. A beautiful breakfast spread had been prepared and put on a big tray on a block in the middle of the boat and it wasn’t long before we gently motored out through the reef markers to ‘chase the sunrise’. We were so lucky the weather was so calm, especially after the storm the day before that uprooted trees. It was so intimately special watching the sunrise as the lights of familiar territory along the Sanur strip turned into places we could identify. We even saw a turtle! I can’t believe I have been holidaying in Sanur for 40 years and have never been out in a local boat before! And then the unfortunate accident happened. My partner went over on his ankle as he crossed the road and twisted to look for traffic. Unable to put any weight on it, we taxied home in despair. The Intercontinental was most sympathetic, providing us with the use of a wheelchair and keeping our spirits up with chocolate mousse cake and fruit to our room. I want to make special mention of Concierge Kurnia who would present even at breakfast and work magic for any query or request we had. Yoga and Tomy were great Reception managers - always very helpful and friendly. All of the staff, without exception were very, very good indeed. Nothing was too much trouble. The location is just perfect, right on the beach path which runs along the beach north and south with lots of little local bars, restaurants and music places. Alternatively the little road the hotel drive is down comes off Jalan Tambligan with lots of shops, restaurants and such. All the guests we talked to were glowing in their opinion of the Intercontinental. I say just go. You won’t regret it at all. We’ll certainly be hopping on the next special that comes up! Loved it!"
"28.","Charisma Indah","24","2025-08-01","5","The tv should be placed facing the bed. The overall is good, the bed is so comfortable, the ambiance was so great as well. last but not least, birthday decoration & the surprise is good"
"29.","Ekaterina Tranter","10","2025-02-01","2","Something went wrong with this hotel. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, but the service is a fail. We had to wait for our room to get ready for 2.5 hours after the proposed check in time , because the hotel could not keep up with cleaning the rooms. The shower walls were very mouldy, it looks as if it was never properly cleaned. Then the bathroom was broken, then couldn't get into the gym, then had to wait for the pool to be open at 8, unless you go to the reception and ask about it. The reception doesn't pick up the phone when you need them. On the check out we were given the wrong invoice. The staff in a restaurant is lovely, but that's about it. The options are limited and the food that supposed to be hot was cold and unpleasant. Won't stay here again"
"30.","Daniela Foti","10","2025-05-01","1","We stayed at the Intercontinental Bali Sanur and it was the worst 6 nights of our Bali holiday. On arrival our check in was 3pm only to be made to wait an hour for our 3 bedroom Villa (Villa 805). The kitchen fridge had mould throughout. The master cupboard had mould in it. The doors to the pool didn’t lock. The deck was badly maintained and had rotten timber which was extremely dangerous. To top off our stay we had items of clothing stolen out of our luggage. For the amount of money we paid I would never stay or recommend this hotel. Extremely disappointing."
"31.","Tim Smith","50","2025-09-01","5","Great location and right on the beach and next to all the action. Breakfast spread amazing, very friendly staff..special mention of Ms Amel and Ms Ayu.. great job 👏 We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, highly recommend this hotel"
"32.","Anne Banks-McAllister","1","2025-04-01","5","We loved our 10 days in our 1-bedroom ocean view room. Our room was huge with a large comfy outdoor room with beautiful views. While rooms are now being renovated our room was still of a very high standard, immaculately clean and serviced daily. The Layang Layang restaurant is outstanding - amazing breakfast options, lovely for dinner and gorgeous decor. A great kitchen! We love the traditional and relaxed feel of the hotel, large infinity pool and stunning gardens. We also enjoyed several visits to the spa! We can’t speak highly enough of ALL staff who were so helpful and friendly. This hotel is right on the beach with great access to good shopping, cafes and restaurants in a quieter family area of Bali. Highly recommended."
"33.","Zanatan Y","7","2025-07-01","1","Worst experience staying here, if you are planning to stay here, I suggest you CHOOSE ANOTHER HOTEL with the same price but you will have a more pleasant experience. 1. The water in the bathroom was so dirty that I sometimes came out black. 2. Hot water that does not work, 3. There are many mosquitoes and flies when entering the room. 4. The interior of the room is quite old so it seems dusty and dirty. Service is very different from other hotels in the same class. Very unmemorable stay here."
"34.","Frozen Heart Prince","22","2025-03-01","1","I am absolutely outraged by the breakfast experience at the Intercontinental Hotel. The meal was shockingly subpar—nothing like the refined, high-quality fare I expect from a 5-star establishment. Instead of a luxurious spread, I was served food that resembled nothing more than cafeteria fare. Considering the nearly $300 nightly rate, this is completely unacceptable. The hotel’s excuse—that the back dining area is under renovation—does nothing to justify this drastic drop in quality. Food should speak for itself, regardless of the surroundings, and there was no mention of any such closure when I booked online. I feel utterly deceived and cheated, as if I was lured into a stay under false pretenses. This has been the worst nightmare of a morning, and it leaves me seething with disappointment and anger. The issues with this hotel seem endless. I tried to use the fitness center, but the key card wouldn’t work, which left me completely confused. To make matters worse, the bathroom near the pool, which only has one toilet, was broken. As a result, I had to walk all the way back to the main building just to use the restroom – something that should never have happened. Additionally, the water here is dirty. I really don’t understand how they have the nerve to charge full price for a room when their service is clearly lacking. Everything looks unkempt, closed off, and unprepared. It’s incredibly disappointing."
"35.","Tommy Ng","3","2025-05-01","1","I recently stayed at InterContinental Bali Sanur Resort and it was a letdown. My room had a lot of ants, especially on the mattress and bathroom, which was really gross. I told the staff, but they didn’t fix it. We couldn’t enjoy our stay at all, especially since it was late at night. I’ve used this brand in other countries without issues, so I expected better. They haven’t offered any compensation for the trouble, which is really disappointing. I definitely wouldn’t recommend this hotel."
"36.","Nicolas Oudin","17","2025-01-01","1","Hotel is under renovation but everybody pretends nothing is happening. I'm staying here now and my room lock stopped working. It took the staff over 1h to fix the lock. In the process they let in a very large lizard into the room ceiling, which pest control was unable to find. A new room was only on the table when I insisted. The staff suggested we stay in the room after pest control setup a trap in the room. I have 2 young kids. It then took the staff over 1h to prepare a new room to transfer to. No efforts are being made to make things right. All this nonsense took up half a day from my precious family holiday time. In general, the main restaurant is closed. Many small things don't work around the resort. Breakfast location is full of flies. It's a well located resort with good bones but just a painfully awful experience when you need the staff to step up to make up for all the renovation disturbances. I highly recommend going elsewhere."
"37.","Гюлтен Хасан","1","2025-01-01","1","The hotel was very bad! We had made a reservation through Booking.com. We checked into the hotel in the evening, and the next day after inspecting the hotel we wanted to leave. There was mold in our room. The breakfast was very bad. The beach had 4-5 sun loungers and was quite unkempt. The hotel was general unkempt. There was renovation work going on in the hotel and it was quite noisy. For people like us who had traveled 12,000 km and had come to Bali for a vacation, this was unacceptable. Nothing in the pictures matched the reality there. After we decided that we wanted to leave, we informed the reception, where they informed us that we had to pay the full amount for the entire stay and that way we could leave. I understand that this is their policy, but nowhere in the hotel description was it mentioned that it would be dirty and noisy in the hotel. After repeated calls and conversations with booking operators, they explained to us that they might refund some of our money. We paid and left the hotel. We were very disappointed! And after our repeated emails, no one gave us any money back! Don't stay there!"
"38.","Kelly F","15","2025-02-01","2","I just checked into the InterContinental Bali Sanur Resort and feel compelled to share my initial impressions. Unfortunately, the experience has been disappointing and does not align with the hotel’s five-star rating. I had requested an early check-in, and the staff initially responded, indicating they would try their best to accommodate. However, not only was this request unmet, but my check-in was also further delayed. The reception staff appeared indifferent, showing little concern for how hot and tired we were, making the experience unwelcoming. During our wait, I noticed the lobby area was dirty, which worsened the overall experience. The cleanliness of the hotel leaves much to be desired. The reception and common areas feature dirty furniture, with some pieces showing signs of pest infestations and noticeable dust accumulation, suggesting infrequent cleaning. The property appears rundown, and the room amenities are comparable to a three-star standard. Having previously enjoyed stays at other InterContinental hotels in Jimbaran, Bali, this experience is particularly disheartening. IHG should reassess this property, as it tarnishes the brand’s reputation. Based on my current experience, I cannot recommend this hotel to others."
"39.","calyppsoo","7","2025-02-01","1","At best this is a 3-star hotel at a 5-star price. My husband and I are on vacation for a month and decided to stay in different parts of the island throughout our stay, so we got an idea of what 5-star means in, Bali. We were very disappointed by check-in. There was a putrid smell that we couldn’t place at first. It ended up being a plumbing issue. When you flush the toilet or take a shower the smell gets worse. The shower was not cleaned properly and had mold. We requested a re-clean, but we ended up having to buy cleaning supplies ourselves and scrub the tiles. There was also mold in the closets. There was a termite and ant infestation. However, an exterminator came in upon request. The A/C did not cool the room down and wouldn’t go down below 22.5 degrees Celsius even if you program it for lower. We also noticed a few people next to us had their front door open to cool down their room. Our room had holes in the floor, the light switches had electrical tape over them, the light above the crown molding was also dead. Bad patch jobs on the walls. The hotel grounds are also falling apart. They are doing construction into the night but not where its needed. It looks like it’s for a new restaurant. The only saving grace was the attentive, polite, and warm staff. Thankfully, we booked this trip with our Venture X card and they were able to get us an early checkout with a refund. We walked over to the Hyatt and are very happy. Hopefully, the new management will address these issues, but for now it’s not worth the price."

"45.","Jeff L","376","2025-04-01","3","Stayed 6 nights Overall, I feel that this hotel shouldn't be a 5* hotel and doesn't really compare to many other 5* we've stayed at. Although the hotels response to other not so good reviews is like we are renovating, yes they are doing some work in some rooms but nothing that we could see elsewhere... General maintenance isn't great. I.e the decking that takes you out to the beach area feels like it's going to collapse under your feet as timbers are flexing. Around the pool, decking is lifting and timbers rotten. 5* price/ 3½* standards Check-in, 5/5 Staff were friendly professional and polite. All of the staff are great Room 5/5 Huge spacious room and it was clean. No bed top sheet tho which makes for an uncomfortable sleep at best, air con keeps you cool, quilt makes you hot. Large balcony, huge bathroom Tea/Coffee in the room...only one tea bag and creamer each stay (didn't ask for more but hey, it's supposed to be 5* hotel. Bottled water supplied Room Wi-fi 2½ /5. Drops in and out constantly Breakfast 4/5 different, good selection and several good options for breakfast inc omelettes and other even more healthy things like fresh juice variations, healthy food bowls. Far from the best Hotel breakfasts we've had in Bali but still very good Staff amazing, very helpful and humble too. 💯 no negativity. Can't give the staff enough praise 10/5 The property in general 4/5. Nice, spacious. Loads of ponds...without any fish 🐠 🐟. No wildlife as in lizards or snails and no mozzies too... nothing. Guessing the place is heavily sprayed/fogged. Kind of think it would have been nice to see some fish and water lillies etc. Location 5/5 on the beach, easy stroll to other beach front restaurants and bars with great great food and music to match. We didn't eat in the hotel other than breakfast (included) Fave eating and drinking spots close were; 1. La Playa. these guys have really good food and drinks and it's really nice sat there watching the (Bali) world pass by. 2. Tapha. Bands / singers Thursday to Tuesday nights from 1900 and what a great location and atmosphere. Most eery night they have different types of live music and all we fantastic. Food good too... And location excellent in the beach Pool 3½ /5. The pool is large and you can sit in the pool looking towards the beach. Shade was non existent and very much needed, most people just can't sit in the hot sun and they didn't...pool was mostly empty until later afternoon...otherwise good. Money changer; the little money changer booth is on the 2nd floor. The person just sits watching the walls. Only mentioning because it seems wrong to stick someone there all day where they should be on ground level. In finishing...we enjoyed our stay but would not stay again due to the high cost. Noting that the hotel had 25% occupancy while we were there."

"49.","Rebecca Morley","5","2025-01-01","3","We stayed at the Intercontinental Sanur for 4 nights in April. The service by staff was brilliant, location is really great and our kids loved the kids club. However we found the resort to be tired and in need of quite a bit of maintenance. The pool had this tape up the whole time we were there which takes away from the lovely view, the pool towels were old and the furniture had seen better days as well as not being much of it around the pool. We chose the hotel due to our IHG membership status and guarantee of complimentary upgrade, which we didn’t receive despite the hotel being at low capacity."
"50.","Desmond Deans","9","2025-01-01","1","This is a very nice hotel in a great location. We are staying for 3 nights. I have already left a honest review on trip advisor and I wanted to add an update to that review, unfortunately trip advisor won’t allow me to do this so I’m am doing it here instead. We checked in on our first day, had a look around then spent some time at the pool. On returning to our suite my wife took a shower, only for the bathroom to flood, leaving approximately 10mm of water all over the bathroom floor, spreading out into the hallway and towards the main room and the exit door. I had to call reception 3 times over around a 30 minute period before any help arrived. The housekeeping staff were excellent in cleaning up but it took a while to get any managerial response. All now seemed to be well. The following after going to the gym I took a shower, only for the problem to repeat itself. Once again it took time for any managerial response. When it finally came the apologised and upgraded us to a lovely suite with sea views. After one night in the new room we noticed a smell in the bathroom, a bit sewage like and then suddenly all the power in the room went down. With no power I could not use the phone to call reception so had to go down to report the issue as well as a defective balcony screen that kept clanging against the metal guard rail all night in the wind. Once again the engineering team and housekeeping came to the rescue and sort it out. As nice as this hotel is it’s been 2 nights of disruption so far. Keeping my fingers crossed that our 3rd and last night will be trouble free. This was meant to be the calm before our long journey home after a fabulous Bali experience but alas it’s not been the case. I don’t want to bash the hotel and maybe we were just unlucky but this has been our experience of the intercontinental. Staff are superb, location is fantastic and hotel itself offers an air of calm and tranquility in all other areas, except the rooms that we stayed in."
"51.","Tobias Hausteiner","62","2025-02-01","2","We stayed here for one night and were pretty disappointed. The hotel was not as expected. Now I have been to many IHG destinations and many other Intercontinental hotels and never have seen anything like this at an Intercontinental hotel. They are under construction, their main restaurant is closed, no club lounge, no sauna, gym is dated and no AC in the elevator… . Furniture seemed very dated, pretty much the same experience as other reviewers have stated over the recent months. The one elevator seems to have been out of order for quite some time now. The pool is alright, however very mixed experience with staff. Some were kind and welcoming, others seemed to not care and weren’t able to greet at all - not the IHG standard! For a beachfront resort, they only have a small offering of beach sunbeds and they are also not very clean. Beach was dirty too. Especially upsetting when walking down the promenade and seeing cheaper hotels having a better offering of sunbeds. Breakfast is in the beachside restaurant due to renovation of the main restaurant. The area is hot, very crowded and the offering is poor compared to the usually great Intercontinental breakfast buffets. Again I am left wondering how all of this construction is going on, but it won’t be mentioned in the IHG app or on booking sites, quite frustrating. All in all unfortunately disappointing, would try the Jimbaran property next time or opt for Rumah Luwih up north."

"53.","Kate Green","3","2025-01-01","5","We had a wonderful 5 nights at the IHG Sanur. The rooms are huge which really suited our family of 5 and we highly enjoyed the outside balcony/living area which was super handy to have once the kids were in bed. Cannot fault the incredible service from the staff, always going above and beyond for any of our requests and always with a friendly smile. Buffet breakfast was extensive and catered to all dietaries. Enjoyed that there was live music most nights and our kids enjoyed the kids club. Much more suited to younger children which was fine for us but those with older children probably wouldn’t work. Pool was a great size with convenient shallow options at each end however probably could have more lounge chairs as in the busy months I can definitely see there being not enough for the demand. Overall we had an amazing stay and will definitely be coming back on our next trip to Sanur."
"54.","Brent Ireland","4","2025-01-01","1","On the 3rd August we abandoned our 6 night stay at Intercontinental Sanur after just 3 hours in the room. This hotel is in an absolute state of disrepair, everywhere you look - it has been neglected and it is at the end of its life as a hotel. The pictures online are NOT how it is now at all - perhaps 10 years ago, but they are not a true reflection by any stretch. Structures in the imagery online do not even exist now - do not trust what you see. We first checked in early and our room wasn’t ready which was no problem - we were shown to the pool and a few alarm bells rang given the state of the facilities - the tiles falling off walls, the collapsing ground around the pools and so much more - I cannot stress how bad the condition of this hotel actually is and we are very frequent travellers. This was our third week in Bali and we have been for 4 resorts prior - the Intercontinental classes itself as 5 star but this place is absolutely not - perhaps at best, 3 stars. When our room was ready, we were taken there and we could not believe the state of the corridors, the elevators were not even operational and it’s clear that they had not been for some time. The room itself from first looks was not that bad, but the red flag was the deck railing was broken from all bottom mounts completely from rust, if you lent on it you risked falling off (we were 3rd floor) and there was no way we were willing to stay 6 nights with a 4 year old in that environment. The duty manager was very understanding and he himself agreed that the hotel was not safe. Credit to him and the other staff, I feel for them having to represent a property that clearly the owners have no interest in maintaining. We have stayed at several intercontinental hotels before and this falls short beyond belief - this would be a 3 star hotel at very, very best. We are awaiting a full refund that was promised - it has now been 5 working days and nothing, which our bank says is not right. Beyond disappointed, don’t end up in the same position, do not book this hotel."

"56.","沙維遠","5","2025-03-01","1","I stayed at InterContinental Bali Sanur Resort for several nights in late December. The Sanur Beach atmosphere was relaxing, and the resort itself had decent facilities and service. However, as some other guests have mentioned, certain areas were in need of maintenance. Overall, our stay was fairly enjoyable at the time—but the nightmare began once I returned home and checked my credit card statement. For some reason, the hotel charged me twice for my stay. I noticed the issue immediately after returning home and contacted the hotel in early January. What followed was a frustrating, drawn-out process of endless emails and follow-ups. On January 16th, after multiple reminders, the hotel finally responded and promised to process the refund within 14 business days. Today is February 7th, and I still have not received my money. To make matters worse, IHG’s customer service keeps giving inconsistent responses—one representative told me I should receive the refund by February 14th, which is already a significant delay in the first place, while another is now saying it will take yet another 14 days. This senior case manager clearly did not read all these lengthy e-mails, which should not exist in the first place, and has not talked to her own team. This level of mismanagement is completely unacceptable. If this is what IHG calls senior case manager, I truly worry about their service standards. This hotel has permanently lost me as a customer. Their offer of a room upgrade at the same hotel as a compensation is a joke—why would I ever stay here again after this experience? Unless you enjoy fighting for your own money for months, think twice before booking with InterContinental Bali Sanur Resort. I will make sure others are aware of this disaster."

Banyak rumput liar bahkan kolam renang pun air sedikit keruh.

Kids club yang kurang terang dan banyak nyamuk. Tempat gym yang sangat tidak lengkap 😭 Yang saya suka dari hotel ini hanya pelayanan dari staff mereka yang sangat ramah. Selebih nya benar benar butuh perbaikan. Tidak sesuai dengan kelas intercontinental dan harga 5jt/night. I'm so sorry"

The cleanliness of the bathroom was very poor. Moulds everywhere. Ants all over in the room. Breakfast spread below average and had ants all over the cakes. The serving plates weren't washed properly and smelled awful. Even though it's at an ideal location, I wouldn't consider this hotel during my next visit.

"66.","randy singh","6","2025-01-01","3","Recently stayed at the InterContinental Sanur for our family vacation. The staff make this hotel and without them it would be a two star rating. We stayed in a 2 room villa which was very spacious and 10 years ago would have been quite amazing. No issues just run down and for the price it’s not really value for money. House keeping was amazing. (As all staff) The second half of the stay we stayed in a 3 bedroom villa. Once again even though it had just been refreshened still outdated. A few minor issues but house keeping and engineering dealt with it very promptly. Is it value for money at $2200 AUD plus, no way. In both the Villa options the pool is amazing !!! Be wary on booking this option if you have a toddler. Breakfast was amazing and the staff made it special every morning. The pool area is great but maintenance is on going on and around the area which seems to be very slow. If you’re staying in the main area of the hotel ask if there’s any weddings as that may change the approach you take with room location. ( weddings normally finish by 10). Kids club - not really a thing. Might be ok for under 2yr olds. The hotel Cafe is hit and miss, if the pool area is busy maybe walk down to a different cafe along the beach. 🛑Make sure before you leave you get all your paperwork required and don’t loose them. If you need any correspondence from the hotel after you check out you could be waiting a few weeks. Once they have your money the care factor is greatly reduced. Shout out to our amazing house keeper and breakfast team at the main restaurant you were amazing."

Because off my bad health i use many painkillers like Fentanyl end Tramadol i didn't I notice that the hostess overcharged me?

From the moment we arrived until the moment we departed, every aspect of our stay was marked by excellence and warmth. First and foremost, the service provided by the entire team was exemplary. The receptionist team, pool team, and restaurant team all went above and beyond to ensure that our needs were met with efficiency and care. Their professionalism and friendliness truly made our stay memorable. The breakfast selection offered a delightful array of options, including simple yet delicious and authentic local delicacies.

Our room exceeded all expectations, offering spacious accommodations that allowed us to relax and unwind in comfort. The attention to detail in the room's design and amenities was evident, contributing to a truly luxurious experience. Furthermore, the cleanliness of the room was impeccable. It was clear that great care was taken to maintain a pristine environment, allowing us to feel at ease throughout our stay. We must commend the entire team for their dedication to ensuring our satisfaction. Their warm hospitality made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived, and their efforts did not go unnoticed.

"69.","Haley Mercedes","59","2025-04-01","3","Went for a Muscle Recovery massage at Sansara as I am staying at a little villa down the road for two nights before going to Gili islands. My upper back and shoulders have been causing me some pain and I was hopeful to get this sorted out. As someone who gets monthly massages, as well as physio and osteo throughout my life, I have a solid understanding of what is good and bad pain. The young lady who was assigned to me, while very sweet, had absolutely no idea what she was doing and was digging her elbows into my spine repeatedly, despite multiple requests (followed by multiple gentle reminders) that the spine should not be given intense, excessive, and repetitive pressure. After about the sixth time I realised this was not getting through and had to end the massage. The receptionist and manager at the spa desk were very understanding and obviously did not make me pay for a massage that I walked out of after 12 minutes, but there’s still no excuse for a masseuse at a higher end hotel not understanding basic anatomy, and possibly causing people injuries."

The garden rooms with large balcony were very comfortable. There is actually no garden view as such as there are screens on the balcony that largely block any view but they are large and vey comfortable. We had an elderly relative and the walk to the lobby is very long but there was a complimentary buggy service to transport to the lobby any time. A few downsides. The check in process was a little long. Also we were told at checkout that there were items missing from the minibar they wanted us to pay for. I never use the minibar and it was odd that either someone else had accessed the minibar or that it hadnt been stocked properly. In the end we were not charged but it was a slightly uncomfortable end to an otherwise very comfortable stay."

"72.","MINJOO RYU","1","2025-01-01","1","I stayed at the Intercontinental Bali Sanur Resort from December 14th to 16th and encountered a major issue with the water quality during my stay. On the first day, rusty brown water with a strong metallic smell came out of the shower when we used it. To make matters worse, the toilet next to the shower booth flushed dark brown water as well. Initially, we thought this was a one-time problem, but it persisted on the second day. Hotel staff came to my room and witnessed these issues firsthand. I requested a refund for my stay, but the Hotel GM, who never made an appearance, refused any form of compensation, stating they needed seven days to complete their investigation. Was my request for a refund unreasonable? Aren’t the photos and video evidence I provided sufficient? For additional context, I always bring a water filter shower head when visiting hotels in Southeast Asia, and during this stay, it turned black and oily from the water."

"74.","MF Ghodsi","188","2025-01-01","3","Our recent stay at Intercontinental Hotel Sanur was a delightful experience overall. From the moment of arrival, I was warmly welcomed by the attentive staff, setting the tone for a pleasant stay. The hotel's convenient parking facilities made it easy to settle in. One of the highlights was the exceptional service provided by the staff throughout the hotel. They were consistently friendly, accommodating, and went above and beyond to ensure my comfort. The room was large, clean and the balcony was amazing, very nice for mum and dad to spend time there while kids are asleep. The hotel boasts a good selection of restaurants offering delicious cuisine. I particularly enjoyed dining at Pier Eight where the food was of excellent quality and the atmosphere was perfect for family dining. Families traveling with children will appreciate the reasonably good kids club facilities, providing entertainment and activities for younger guests. Intercontinental Hotel Sanur's location is another advantage, being close to an array of restaurants and attractions that Sanur has to offer. It was convenient to explore the area and enjoy the local dining scene. However, a major downside was the disappointing pool design. Despite being an infinity pool, the ocean views obstructed completely by trees, detracting from the overall point of it. Additionally, there were not enough shaded areas or seats around the pool, making it challenging to find a comfortable spot to relax. The kids' pool being isolated/positioned elsewhere was also very inconvenient. The property sprawls across expansive grounds with ample gardens and open space, yet much of it remains underutilised. The pool is located quite a distance from the rooms, requiring a considerable walk to access. Additionally, given we paid close to $500 per night, it was disappointing to see that the hotel is in need of significant maintenance and upkeep such as tap wear, electrical, etc throughout its premises. Overall, our stay at Intercontinental Hotel Sanur was enjoyable, thanks to the excellent service, good dining options, and convenient location. However, improvements to the pool area and the hotel in general would enhance the overall guest experience."

"76.","Em.","40","2025-01-01","1","It was probably an opulent hotel back in its hey day but has since been left poorly maintained and neglected. Staff trying their best to please but they can only do so much they can do when everything is falling apart. - Our room door lock already ran out of battery upon checking in and had to be replaced - Conditioner, shampoo, body wash arent being refilled (conditioner was empty when we checked in) - Waterfall shower head was broken, literally hanging off the side - Shower doesn't drain, probably because it hadn't been properly cleaned for ages, and there's shower grime everywhere - No sound proofing in rooms, we can hear the next room TV at night, and the sound of the gardener sweeping in the morning - The Lobby and the public grounds are in general state of disrepair and uncleanness (think stains on the lobby sofa and broken tiles) - Bath towels had stains and frayed on the edges, similar to those that you see in a massage parlor. We were given complimentary afternoon tea to compensate the underwhelming experience, but really I'd just rather a clean, comfortable and sound proofed room and that shouldn't be much to ask for in a 5 star hotel."

"78.","Russell Williams","3","2025-01-01","5","The beds are incredibly comfortable and the bathrooms and balconies are super spacious. My favorite was the beach side restaurant Pier 8. Great food and comfortable seating, all right next to the sea. Great breeze. Our waitress, Novita was a star!!!!"
"79.","Catherine Hoyle","15","2024-01-01","1","It's the most expensive on the beachfront with the least to show for it. Pool water was very hot (November), depth is 1.5m (so we as shorties couldn't stand) so it was completely unusable for us. The beach chairs are unmonitored so filled with non-guests shouting and smoking with guards just looking on - seriously lacking exclusivity. Every other hotel monitors this. You are given one towel and one hand towel each! Robes are tired and one was ripped. Lighting controls are haphazard. Air-Con unit to small for the large room. Rooms are very dark, the loggia (which is most of the room) is outdoors so not very comfortable to use. Resort not in great repair. Two of the lifts out. Walls scrapped. The stairs to our room looked like fire stairs (see pic). Cannot believe we paid $400 a night - feel like an idiot. Sent feedback to resort and the reply was we will use your comments to coach our team in order to provide a better experience in the future. Assume a similar one will appear below this.... Lip services so making a public review for others now so they arent ripped off."
"80.","여행.","82","2025-01-01","5","I stayed here for about a month and was treated kindly throughout the month. Sabur Beach is a quiet place, so it was very comfortable to stay with my family. The food is delicious and the breakfast changes slightly every day. There weren't many people in the pool, so it was very nice to swim. Thank you to all the staff for being so friendly."
"81.","putu Sandiasa","1","2025-02-01","2","Dining experience at the pier eight found very disappointing, the staff not attentive. We are four they provide napkins only 2 until we have to request extra. We request tabasco received almost the empty bottle, ice cream dessert send with fork untill we complaint ask for correct spoon but given big spoon. Unbelievable!"
"82.","Peter Hofman","4","2024-01-01","5","My Wife & I recently stayed 7 nights in a Junior Suite Ocean View room to celebrate our wedding Anniversary. Check in was pleasant, welcoming and friendly. Our newly renovated room was Spacious, Clean and had all the luxuries you would expect of an Intercontinental Hotel. The large balcony was used every day to relax, listen to music and read a book. Breakfast was beautiful, made to order eggs, 5 different ways and there was nothing more you could have wished for. The Staff were very happy and friendly, by our second morning they were greeting us by our names. Afternoon drinks in the lobby were great and the live music was a very cool way to enjoy sunset. We were very fortunate the Hotel was not busy and most afternoons we had the Pool to ourselves. The Pool Staff were attentive to whatever we required - iced water, cocktails, beers, nothing was too much effort. We ate twice at the Peir Eight Bar on the beach, Yanti made us very welcome, and our service was amazing - both nights we ate dinner on the beach with our feet in the sand. Yanti also organized our Jukung Floating Breakfast out on the boat. We watched the sunrise while eating our pastries and drinking coffee and tea, this was another activity the Hotel offered, and we were both extremely glad we did it. We would like to take this opportunity to thank all the Staff at Intercontinental Bal Sanur Resort for their hospitality and service and would recommend this Hotel to anyone looking for beautiful week in Sanur."
"83.","frey cee","64","2025-01-01","5","We had the most beautiful 7 nights here. You feel relaxed and welcome the minute you arrive. The rooms are so big, clean and comfortable, the gardens and pools are great. The staff are exceptional and will do everything they can to help you, nothing is every a worry or too hard. The food is freh and delicious and the breakfast is great, it is fabulous having buffet and a la carte options. The java noodles on room service will change your life and the coffee at breakfast is probably the best I have had in Bali. Beach access out the back is straight onto the pathway and the beach is lovely. It is in a corner of the bay so seaweed collects but literally 50m up the beach it is fine. Kids activities are great the bonfire marshmellows, firedancing and kite making were a big hit. It seems a lot of the negative reviews, focus on the little things. Yes there are some parts of the hotel that need a bit of repair, like missing letters on signs and the water pressure in the shower is not fantastic but these are minor details and I choose not to focus on them. It is lear things are always being repaired and worked on and I am yet to find a hotel in Bali which is 100% immaculate. My only small piece of feedback would be to fix the waterfeatures on some of the ponds as the stangant water does attract mosquitos but they have people cleaning it out every day. Overall the value for money given the location, sheer size and luxury of the rooms, quality of food, staff and the pools is really very good. If you want a cheaper hotel in this area, you will be away from the beach, in a much shabbier hotel or in a room 1/3 the size. Thank you for a beautiful stay and so many lovely memories."
"84.","jinnie kim","54","2024-01-01","5","The price is reasonable compared to other famouse hotel. I ordered extra bed the quality was great. They visited several times a day to clean our room. They served free drinks everyday 5-7pm. (2cocktails per person) There is a free photograph program too. breakfast buffet was good but the vegetable was not fresh. And the pool is not attached to the beach. You have to go upstairs to reach there. Except some disadvantages, the location was nice and every staff was kind."
"85.","Basic Parisian","5","2025-01-01","3","The hotel is ideally located right on the beach, with quick access to the promenade. The ocean view is great ! Rooms are spacious and bedding is pleasant. The overall experience is ok for a hotel in Bali. However, it's not up to that of a 5-star hotel. Having stayed at the Indigo Seminyak a few days earlier, with a great experience, it's hard to imagine that the InterContinental Sanur is part of the same hotel group, IHG. For a better experience, the hotel needs to improve on room maintenance (e.g. cleanliness of walls, see picture room 416) and common areas (e.g. more regular cleaning of pool toilets). As for the pool experience, the cocktails and service are top-notch, but the welcome can be improved. Setting up the guests' bed seems more appropriate for a 5-star hotel than handing them towels to find a seat. I hope this comment will help the hotel to offer a better experience to future guests."
"86.","Taha Aljunied","222","2025-01-01","5","The rooms are huge. That’s the biggest plus, there definitely needs more maintenance in the rooms and around the resort. Breakfast was okay, actually very good tasting food just maybe lacked the variety that I am used to at other hotels in bali."

The duty manager came and said sorry for what the problem we got, and gave us more than thousand of member point, we also say thank you on that. We really love stay at Sanur area, but we have to think and take other consider to re-stay at InterContinental Sanur if they still have some issue on what we had on our stay."

"92.","Glynis","67","2024-01-01","3","Spent three nights at Intercontinental. Renovations are quite spectacular with ridiculously hip designer features. Some stunning pieces on display. But its people that make a hotel successful and unfortunately this hotel lacks atmosphere and vibe. It was pretty, but dull. Only half the hotel operational and that unfortunately made for a fairly soulless experience. The staff seem overloaded at times and not particularly happy. Housekeeping a particular problem I suspect with rooms not being serviced until late afternoon and even then only after a phone call to hassle. An empty mini bar and no information or help in how to 'drive' the room. We never mastered the lighting, but soon figured out the toilet eco-wash . LOL! The pool area is lovely, but we were informed we were not allowed to order cocktails poolside which was a bit of a downer on arrival. Two days later we were! Gardens are obviously still being established and water features are still a work in progress. Breakfasts were lovely and so were the restaurant staff. Good coffee and a shout out to the charming Vera. Room was beautifully decorated, but rather dark and moody with brown furnishings and no sunlight penetrating. Super comfy bed! Rough garden outside the shade cloth blind, so not a nice outlook. Great bathroom. Would have liked a stocked bar fridge and some brochures/info. A printed room service menu is preferable to using a QR code to get into TV menu. I'm on holiday - I want stuff to be quick and easily accessible."
"93.","Chan Meng","24","2023-01-01","4","What we liked: 1. Big rooms with huge airy balconies where we can spend time without air-conditioning. 2. Strong water pressure in the shower. 3. Rain showers. 4. We can actually set the temperature in the rooms. 5. Lovely polite staff, always offering to help. 6. Wide vegetarian and vegan options in the breakfast buffet with a good choice of nuts. 7. Free (flow) cocktails from 5-6pm at the hotel’s Pier 8 beach side restaurant. 8. Complimentary Snacks and drinks all day at the lobby. 9. Plenty of hooks in the bathroom to hang towels, clothes, washed masks. 10. Beautiful views from the balcony. What we would have preferred: 1. Covered walkways all the way to the beach and the hotel’s Pier 8 restaurant by the beach. It rains a lot on Dec, and having to walk in the rain isn’t pleasant when it gets heavy. 2. Well maintained and IHG branded umbrellas. The umbrellas we loaned were a mish mash of design, although they were certainly large enough. 3. Replace broken furniture in the rooms / bathroom. Our bathroom in 421 had a pedestal by the bathtub that was cracked and had sharp edges and looked out of place in the otherwise clean and well designed bathroom. See pic. The metal grills in the balcony also couldn’t open fully as the left side was stuck, and was left stuck throughout our stay even though the staff knew about it. 4. Let the guests know where the shampoo, shower gel and body lotion came from. They were simply labeled “shampoo”, “shower” and “body lotion” and were unbranded, which is surprising for an Intercontinental. 5. If hotel activities could carry on as scheduled. We wanted to attend the Jazz night at Pier 8 on Fri evening. After braving the rain, we were told by the Pier 8 staff that there wasn’t going to be live music and the piped music would just be pop. As we left we could see that they had set up the keyboard and microphone for live music, and there appeared to be 2 dresses musicians just sitting there scrolling thru their phones and smoking. Overall a great stay. For the price we paid, the hotel could have paid more attention to maintenance details."
"94.","Finn Stolle","84","2025-01-01","1","I would definitely not come again. It’s not worth the high price. Very old rooms, aircon makes everything wet. Food in the restaurant was very slow, my wife got sick from the food as well. Not what you expect from a 5 star resort, better look for a different type place to stay!"
"95.","Patricia Yeo","190","2025-01-01","5","We had a memorable stay at Intercontinental Sanur all thanks to Rama, Justin Angelina and Raka for making sure our room is clean and surprising us with little surprises throughout our stay from 25-30 May 2024. The check-in was seamless. The rooms are spacious and even have zipped tracked to block out insects and the heat on a sunny day, and yet enable us to enjoy the fresh Bali air with privacy. The hotel is just beside the beach which has intertidal zone during low tide which my son absolutely loves. They have a section of the sea cordoned off so that boats do not park in that area, which allows guests to swim or soak in the sea during high tide. It is safe as the big waves are further out. Intercontinental Sanur also has a functional Kids Club where it is well furnished with a little tree house, toys, books and crafts for all ages. We also enjoyed our daily breakfasts at Layang Layang restaurant which has both alfresco and indoor dining. They have a wide variety of cuisines to choose from and my favorite is the fruits and freshly squeezed juices selections. A great thank you to Andrini, Artini, April and Alvis as well - you guys make the A Team."
"96.","Peter Anderson","72","2024-01-01","2","Avoid staying here at least until the renovations are complete. Was awoken at 08:00 during my stay by hammering and grinding sounds. Not a great hotel considering they are charging the same amount as other much more luxurious hotels in Nusa Dua. No loyalty recognition as IHG Platinum on check-in, no late check-out offered and when asked the latest they can do is 1pm despite the hotel being seemingly quiet. Rooms look tired, no fruit on arrival, only 2 bottles of water given per day, power points next to the bed dont work, no espresso machine in the room, bathrooms have not been refreshed in many years, and beds are so soft my partner and I woke up with sore backs in the mornings. There was also white mould growing in the bathroom (see pic attached to this review) — not great for a 5 star hotel. The pros is that the balcony area of the Junior Suite is lovely and quite private, the hotel currently offers 2 free drinks per person per day at the lobby lounge bar, and all the interactions with staff were friendly and positive. Based on the value for money, lack of status recognition, and current issues with the property, I won't be returning."
"97.","Mark Etterlin","11","2024-01-01","4","Very nice hotel. Although they are still finishing up the remaining renovation, service is already at a very good level. Breakfast is awesome and the location could not be much better with easy access to the beach and some very good restaurants. The only but is, that although some parts are supposed to be freshly renovated, it already looks a little worn out 🤷‍♂️"

Layang-layang restaurant has pretty tasty food, lots of variety catering to halal options. Gym facility is alright, multiple treadmills, stationary bikes, dumbbells and machines for all muscle groups. Staff of IBSR are very friendly and attentive. They make us feel welcomed and are ready to assist in anyway they can. One example like Angel, a trainee in the hotel that has initiative. While at the beach area, she happily agreed to take care of our drinks and handphones as we head to the sea. Also kindly offered iced water for us after the walk. All the best to her future endeavors. Great experience overall. 👍"
"100.","Reyner Gunawan","570","2024-01-01","5","Had a great experience staying with them. Old but well maintained and still stylish at the same time.. luxury meet tranquility and local vibe. Check in was a bit of a problem, didnt come early but room is still not available, so we were asked to wait in the lobby area presented with a complimentary high tea, very much appreciated.. after around 40 mins of enjoying our meal with live piano on the background, we were told that our room is ready. Big spacious room, facing the sea, beautiful view. Beaitiful room. Nice comfy bed, nice pillow as well. Bathroom is also spacious with nice bath tub. Amenities were also great. Spacious terrace with great seating area. Perfect room.. Breakfast was great, they have both buffet and a la carte menu that we can choose from. Enjoyed it a lot. Pool was big enough to swim around and enjoy the view. The hotel also provided a free cocktail during certain hours at the hotel's bar.. perfect!!"

"102.","Brian Im","8","2024-01-01","1","New management and ownership do not value their guests and fail to treat them with even a modicum of hospitality. I had a re-booking guarantee made with the property stemming from COVID restrictions that made it impossible to enter Bali on the original stay dates. Not only did new management refuse to honour the original terms of the promise, they arbitrarily imposed additional restrictions on them without any warning or consultation. Only when I called them out on this by providing the original correspondence did they remove these additional restrictions (still refusing to honour the original agreement) while acting as if they were doing me some big favour. I should have just refunded in full through my insurance when I had the opportunity but I thought there would be no issues as I was dealing with a high end hotel brand. Big mistake on my part. I will never book this property again and would suggest others to do the same, Sanur has so many better hotels who will go above and beyond to make your stay pleasant."
"103.","Julia van der Kooy","7","2023-01-01","4","We stayed here for 3 nights at the beginning of April 2022 and had a pleasant stay. Only 1 of their three restaurants was open and the spa was also closed, we were surprised by this as we didn’t see that notice on the website. They hosted the spa in one of the private villas instead and ran a good promotion so that made up for the closure. The grounds and facilities are quite beautiful but it seemed like they were short on staff as some areas were unkept/unclean. The beach-area was ok, although we would have expected to see it better maintained. Pool was fantastic we sat here everyday but again, could have been maintained better as there was a ring of green algae around the edge of the pool. The room was nice and definitely had 5 star potential, but the bathroom- specifically the shower was dirty. We would have also expected a spa menu/dining menu/hotel info booklet in the room. Overall we would stay here again as it seems like they are putting in the effort to get up and running after the pandemic."
"104.","Katie Lonsdale","35","2023-01-01","5","Me and my extended family had an excellent stay at The Intercontinental. From start to finish the staff were amazing and accommodated every request, often going above and beyond our expectations.

Thank you!"
"105.","Linda W","43","2025-01-01","5","We arrived on Thursday 8Feb24 noon for 3N stay, met FO officer Tomy who assisted us warmly and promptly 👍🏻👍🏻 thank you Tomy 🌸 As we entered the room of Junior suite - 311, the suite is super super spacious, about 90 square meter I guess and as 3 adults stay here, the HK also set the extra bed for our daughter. Nothing to be complained about from the bed area, the balcony and the bathroom area. All amenities as expected, presented perfectly. We feel it is a blessing as the balcony has the nice view of Sanur sea and we can smell the natural frangipane fragrance from all frangipane trees planted at the garden and sounds of birds chirping. Below is the lobby yet surprisingly is still calm, quite and can hear the traditional music. The evening when we return from sightseeing about 10.30pm, the staff already did the turn down service. The spread of breakfast was nice and enough. What we like as they provide the Indonesia herb-drinks (jamu) and the fresh mixed-juice by request (redbeet, carrot, ginger, celery, bokchoy veggie). The spread of salad also quite complete, the choice of yoghurt - dried fruits - fresh fruits cutting were good. I didn't try the cooked food but I saw they have Indonesia porridge and side dishes; also some breads and varieties of croissants and pastries. Not yet trying to other facilities yet but will do today. However our daughter loves this place and yes... for her wedding we will surely opt for Intercon - Sanur. She loves the swimming pool area which is very spacious. Thank you Intercon-Sanur for your hospitality, definitely we will enjoy the next 2 days in Bali and have no regrets to chose your property. Keep up the good work 👍🏻"

"107.","David Templeman","21","2025-01-01","5","I stayed here for two weeks with my wife and two young boys. We would highly recommend the hotel. We particularly loved the friendly staff throughout. Other highlights were breakfast, the kids club and the lovely Rini and Laksmi, the beachfront location and the gym. There is a huge infinity pool and two small pools. There are no features for kids as such but plenty of space to splash around without disturbing other guests. Sanur is a great location to base yourself with kids. Right out the front of the hotel is a nice beach with loads of restaurants and bars. The walkway stretches many kms."

The hotel was kind enough to just upgrade it for me. The hotel is well located with Sanur beach just at the back of the hotel. Some rooms and villas are still under renovation (not sure mine is renovated already or not, but i would guess not. Yet it still look fantastic). And as i always experience, excellent IHG service. When we were checked in already, the manager in duty came to our villa in the late afternoon, introduced himself, and apologise in advance for all the renovation work around the area which might bother us."

Fairly priced and perfectly sitting location in front of the beach (so relaxing). Food was always fresh and very tasty. Kids club - Beautiful decor (my kids (2&5) loved from the minute they entered) Extremely professional staff and well caring towards kids. Prof babysitter can be hired from outside and are allowed to use the space and surroundings Pools - Clean, very neatly kept and located at an extremely relaxing space of the hotel. Kids have a seperate pool which is amazing, child friendly, clean and warmly welcoming Room services - very professional, anything asked for came in less than 5 minutes, staff were extremely helpful. They even provided service where they used to get everything ready for bed time (1st time experience of this but amazing feeling when everything is ready to tuck into beds) This hotel is located to walking proximity of everything. We really enjoyed our stay. Been treated as 5 star guests with respect and kindness. Staff were fantastic, very helpful, kind and extremely professional. We want to thank the full team for making so many efforts in looking after us for 5 days. We are definitely looking forward to book again with them. **We were worried like anyone reading all the reviews but guys worth trying the place due to so many efforts by staff and their hard work to provide excellent service. They treat every guest as a King, Queen, Prince and a Princess*** Beautiful Bali...our new family holiday destination💗"
"111.","Leanne Parsons","52","2024-01-01","3","I feel I need to start by saying that this is not a reflection on the staff at this hotel. It’s the hotel itself and how I didn’t feel like I got the intercontinental experience I was hoping for. I had also just come from an 8 night stay at another hotel (The Anvaya in Kuta) and was coming to the IC for 3 days of luxury & quiet, however the Anvaya was far nicer and lived closer to my IC expectations. I have also stayed at the IC in Jimbaran Bay and this hotel does not come close to being at the same standard. We didn’t get off to a great start, when the room key didn’t open the door when we first arrived and then on departure day (around 08:00) I asked about my guaranteed 4pm late check out, said they would check as someone was booked in our room after us. Didn’t get an answer so went back to reception at 12:30 to check, all ok to keep room until 4pm. But then our key didn’t work when trying to access at 14:30! Back to reception to get that fixed! Attention to detail is lacking, for example missing letters from signs; no real IC branding or vibe; large temple/water feature laying stagnant & brown, in fact, very few water feature seems to be working. Room is lovely and large with the biggest balcony I have ever seen! However the shower pressure is so bad; I would go as far to say it’s the worst shower I have ever had! This must have been our room specificity, as the shower room we had in the evening was fine. First morning we could smell smoke at 4:30am coming from a bonfire outside of the hotel & the smell was seeping into room. Reception gave us an oil burner for the room, happened on first night which was really bad and our last night which was much lighter. (We stayed 3 nights in total!) Staff were all very lovely and courteous. The hotel was not overly busy, which allowed them to remember room numbers of guests when ordering drinks or food. Pros: - Breakfast included- however not as many options as IC in Jimbarron Bay (breakfast not included) or other Bali hotels I have stayed in - Great location. Plenty of outside restaurants both on the street and beach - Was given 1000 extra IHG points due to construction and also given a free cocktail in the lounge bar from 5-7pm - Nice and quiet around the pool. No loud music or entertainment. Large wide sunbeds and even couples double beds. Iced cold water served at pool when you arrive - Nice seating area around pool if you want to eat or drink without leave the pool area and have causal dining (rather than sitting on your sunbed) Cons: - Under construction so quite noisy in the daytime - Hot water pressure very poor in shower, told reception but still no change, which we were not surprised about. This really did make for a bad experience - Huge orchid statue around the pool blocking the view. Also a bit of an eyesore and not the greatest looking piece - Online beverage menu for pier eight has incorrect pricing, it’s actually higher - Does not have a tv room or waiting area if your flight is delayed or later in the evening. They did however allow for us to book a room to have a quick shower Overall, I probably wouldn’t stay at this hotel again, not at least until after the renovations and even then I think if I stay in Sanur again, I’d try somewhere else or I’d stay at IC in Jimbaran Bay."
"112.","Ken","162","2024-01-01","1","Generally disappointing experience. Don't expect a 5 star experience. Check in was ok. Staff is nice, polite, earnest and attentive as usual in Bali. The receptionist wasn't sure if my booking under the Amex Hotel Collection qualified for points or if I should get an upgrade because of my IHG Diamond + Intercontinental Ambassador status. I didn't get anything in the end. I got a garden view upgrade to the 3rd floor but it didn't really seem like an upgrade when I walked around the property most of the first floor rooms had open doors and construction going on anyway. But that's fine as I didn't know the full terms of the Amex hotel collection booking either. The room was fine mostly. But the bathtub was broken (the stopper was stuck in and wouldn't let water drain). They spent some hours in my room to fix this so I had to work in the pool cafe but then they had a children's practice dance out of nowhere. Didn't seem like a performance put up for guests but some external usage of the space? Finally, more than half the hotel is under renovation due to I imagine covid so quite a bit of the property is derelict or in disrepair. You will walk past walls with peeling paint, rotting wood, staircases and walkways with no lighting or lighting fixtures with bare sockets and many rooms under construction and workers milling about. Most of the gardens seem to be maintained but some areas look neglected. The pool has some beds that are in disrepair and need replacing. See photo. The fabric is totally frayed and torn off. Haven't been to a 5 star hotel before that had furniture looking like this. I think the flower sculpture is also a bit weird looking and out of place with the aesthetic of the place. Finally, the breakfast. It's ok mostly but I ate a tomato the last morning that seemed a bit.. off. Additionally many of the fruit station had fruit flies buzzing, which I suppose is natural. I asked when the renovations and upgrading would be completed. They didn't know. I suppose you'd want to hold off on staying at this property until that's completed fully. I don't think the property owners should be selling rooms when the property is in this state, honestly speaking."
"113.","Minghao Wang","5","2025-01-01","1","Unbelievably, this is the worst InterContinental Hotel I have ever stayed in. It’s my honeymoon trip but I’m so disappointed. Inoperable Lights: when we try to sleep, I discovered that the one light could not be turned off. Stained Sheets: the bed sheets were visibly stained. As a guest, I expect clean and well-maintained linens, and this oversight was unacceptable. Front Desk Communication Failure: When I contacted the front desk to request a room change, I was promised a callback. Regrettably, no one followed up, leaving me frustrated and without a resolution. I have to visite the front desk in person, but the response was equally disappointing. Long Wait for Room Change: The front desk informed me that changing rooms would take over an hour due to cleaning procedures(Funny, 11:30 PM NOW). Considering our late arrival (after a long day of travel), this delay was highly inconvenient. Exhaustion and Sleep Deprivation: My wife and I were exhausted from our journey, having visited Mt Bromo at 1 a.m. and then traveled to Bali. By the time we arrived at the hotel around 9PM and trying to go to bed (around 11:30 p.m.), we were desperate for rest. Unfortunately, the prolonged wait for a room change prevented us from getting the rest we desperately needed. Reluctance to Disturb My Wife: Despite the inconvenience, I cant sleep while with light on, but I chose not to wake my wife to change rooms. She was already asleep, and I didn’t want to disturb her further. Consequently, I endured an uncomfortable situation."

The room was very nice and spacey, roomservice took good care and always made us nice animals from Towels and put flowers all over. We were welcomed very nicely with flowers all over our bed, a cake and lots of nice gestures from the staff. All workers there are super friendly and they all remembered my name after day two. I would like to also highlight a worker named „Regie“. This man went out of his way to make our stay a special one. He was always so happy and full of energy and always made any wish come true. There is no waiting with Regie, he gets it done immediately. Even after we had booked out he helped us find a room To shower before our long flight, which was so relieving. I am very thankful for this man and will come back to this hotel for sure, when I come back to Bali. The restaurants provide good food, all of it fresh and tasty. There are not tons of meals that you can choose, but more than enough to eat something else any day. There is also a good mix of local cuisine and western cuisine. We are super happy that we chose this hotel for our 14 days of honeymoon."
"115.","Melinda Sawers","18","2025-01-01","5","This genuinely IS a place worth all five stars. Opulence in the rooms, friendly and helpful staff, literally has the beach at the gate, surrounded by quality beachfront restaurants, live Balinese and Western music, stunning art works, the best Indonesian hotel breakfast I’ve ever seen, stunning tropical gardens and abundant water features, and my favourite place - the huge, calm swimming pool overlooking the beach at dawn. Special mention to Yanti at the Pier Eight restaurant and bar for really looking after us with local information and great food."

That makes me enjoy and forget the life problem. I wish one day to rsvp or book the hotel room. Today my experience was a visit to the hotel spa, that is my first time to feel the spa moments with Balinese song sound and other facilities I really recommend the spa facility, the price is competitive if you compare with other spa in Bali"

"120.","Regina Cheah","80","2023-01-01","3","We just spent a week here in the villa as well as one of their suites. We had booked this as a big family holiday (11 people) for 2 years ago when it was still Fairmont but had to delay it due to covid. Intercontinental was nice enough to honour the booking so we had to use it by end of this year. This is the only reason we did not just check out and go somewhere else as it was already paid up. We got there after 3pm and was told the rooms were still not ready but not given a specific reason why. We had 5 kids who had been travelling the whole day already and were just keen to get them settled in. After waiting around for a while and pressing further, then they told us the issue and that they were trying to fix it. We requested they let us check in anyway while they try to fix the issue. We only ended up getting to our room after 4pm. We waited all evening for them to fix the aircond issue but in the end they said it couldn't be fixed and that they had no other room for us so some of us ended up having to sleep in the room with no air-conditioning which was very stuffy. The next day they kept saying they could fix the issue but by afternoon it was clear it wasn't happening so after speaking to the acting GM he then said they can give us the villa next door (which begs the question why this wasn't provided earlier). The next issue is that we found glass on the floor of the pool that was in the villa. Luckily none of the kids got hurt, but totally unacceptable safety-wise. In the next door Villa part of the ceiling outside collapsed overnight which was also very dangerous if that happened during the day. Overall I'm not sure if the villas have been refurbished yet but we felt the furniture was all quite old and everything just a bit worn. Be aware that the hotel is undergoing major renovations so more than half the hotel is non functional and running at a low capacity. Only one restaurant is functioning (Pier Eight) and the menu is about 80% the same as the in room dining menu. The food is decent enough but for longer stays there is not enough variety. Breakfast buffet was in Layang Layang and was OK. They try their best to rotate the hot food (about 8 options) but other than that the rest are the same and minimal for a 5-star hotel. The main pool is nice and the kids club is good too (although the location is also a bit strange). They had a list of resort activities for the week but when I inquired they weren't actually running it (like the Uluwatu lace workshop). They did have the kite making one though which was great for the kids and the kites really did work. There is beach access but don't expect a nice quiet beach. The hotel is situated between a row of shops and restaurants and there are alot of boats in the water. The beachfront for Hyatt Regency is alot better and quieter with less boats. We spent alot of time at Hyatt Regency for meals since Intercon had limited options and Hyatt Regency is only a 6 minute walk along the beach with a kids menu. There are of course alot of other food options along the whole stretch as well but for a big group like ours it was difficult. To be fair the management is trying hard to bring the resort back to life after covid. They offered F&B credit and a free high tea to make up for all the issues. However I think they are about 2 years out from getting to a 5-star hotel standard."
"121.","Perry Stavenuiter","207","2025-01-01","1","Absolutely outdated, dirty, the beds didn’t get clean at all, despite being cleaned 4 times in a row. Hairs, fungus on the mattress, spots on the blankets. The first couple nights the bedsheets didn’t fully cover the beds either. The rooms smell badly. Just avoid this place…."
"122.","megan Anderson","4","2024-01-01","2","Stayed for one night and although the room and hotel was spacious, the whole place needs a facelift. We booked a month or two out from arrival and were only told our room type wasn't available a week before arrival due to renovations. I used my American express for the first time at the hotel (after travelling overseas) and was bombarded with fake emails from supposedly American express themselves. The bathroom was dirty and the shower drain was blocked so you had to stand in a pool of water. Would not recommend staying here until after the works are complete. Disappointing for an intercon. Stay at the hotel next door instead. Friends were raving about it."
"123.","Sangini","56","2024-01-01","5","This is such a wonderful property! I honestly wasn’t expecting much since the time I got to know it was partly under renovation. The service recovery offered for this inconvenience is excellent! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and had barely any issues. Hospitality is always about the people and the staff here go above and beyond to make your stay so enjoyable. They are always ready for a chat and make you feel at home! I definitely wouldn’t have enjoyed my stay as much if it wasn’t for the staff. Special thanks to Novi, Ary, Dwi, Juli, Wahyu, Tifani and Pasek! All other staff is exceptional too. Every single person is smiling and always greets you no matter when and where. The rooms are well designed and seem extremely luxurious. Great breakfast, although very limited on vegan/vegetarian options with incorrect labelling on some. Not a huge issue but could be improved. Luxurious, spacious property and I will definitely be back here on my next holiday to Bali! Thank you IHG Bali Sanur team! Keep up the good work :)"
"124.","Vincent Pantow","54","2025-01-01","1","Please don’t stay here. Wrote this immediately after checking out. The rooom: No maintenance. No service. Very dirty. Dimmer for the lights not working even from a far you can see the lobby is very bright. Their dimmer doesn’t work as well. Front office also tricky not wanting to settle my bill with the fund they held at check in. I’ve canceled other hotels to try this one and regretted it. Public toilets dirty. You can see from the toilet bowl on the picture attached near the restaurant. They also left a durian on their public space. Room I’ve got bugs that I left dead. It took three days to cleaned. On the last day they did not provide a pillow case, I used a towe instead. They only use daily workers so their cost of labor is cheap. Local government should take notice as I was served by a waiter during breakfast. Late night I arrived back from dinner the poor fella is still there. I could go on and on. Will give review direct with IHG apps as well. Tired of complaining since I knew from the beginning when I checked in this place will be a disappointment."
"125.","Yuki","1","2024-01-01","1","The most unpleasant experience I've ever had with a hotel stay. First off, I booked a room with a king-sized bed for one person, doing so three months in advance. However, at the last minute, the hotel informed me that they were unable to provide the room I booked and instead assigned me to a lesser room featuring two single beds. They offered a minor credit as compensation, but this was nothing short of a farce. An even worse episode unfolded as follows: After returning from a day-long event, completely exhausted, the shower room drain clogged up during my shower, resulting in an extensive flood. I was utterly disgusted and had no choice but to evacuate the bathroom while still covered in soap. I then had to endure an uncomfortable wait of roughly 20 minutes for the maintenance team to rectify the blockage. To add insult to injury, the hotel was undergoing renovations during my stay, causing disruptive noise that rudely awoke me the next morning. It was such an unnerving and repulsive experience."

I called the hotel to confirm and the hotel couldn't guarantee the bed type, no way am I paying $600 to sleep in a single bed!! Also the Club lounge access is extremely misleading, it's not like most lounges where it's free flow canapes a alcoholic drinks. You just get 2 cocktails and nothing else... I asked if they could do beer and was told I might be able to get some... For the cost it's all too vague.. I still have 4 stars because I'm sure it's great but not for me."
"131.","Chaplin Hong","76","2024-01-01","5","This hotel is currently having some renovation works which should be completed by June 2023. The lady duty manager who managed to greet us when arrival and our departure - thank you for the warm hospitality! What a smooth check in experience Room- we are very thankful to be given that suite. Room 436 - this room have potential and it's definitely worth paying for the upgrade to this room if you are considering about it. The size, the view, the spaciousness. Nothing to complaint about Location - right by the beach! I mean, the cafes and restaurants are definitely going to give the hotel's FNB a run for it's money! Overall experience - don't let the current renovation dampen your thought about this place. We appreciate the quietness, and yet can see the potential of this resort in the years to come. Yes, there's some urgent work that needs to be done, e.g. level 1 men toilet entrance ceiling, but hey! Give this resort a chance ! Personnel to give credit - 1.Suharta from the breakfast team. Abang! Thank you for taking so much care of my family and I, we appreciate it. Best of luck with the kiddo! Esp with the English language course. Please continue to show your care towards your guests, and rightfully showcase the IHG True Hospitality! 2. The front office team - we have had a small issue with our luggage, but the message was transferred from one shift to next tastefully, and the concern given by staff were so genuine, esp the bellman uncle. Keep up the good job guys!"
"132.","Glyn Walker","137","2024-01-01","5","I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Intercontinental Sanur Bali, and I must say it was an exceptional experience and truly embodies IHGs true hospitality ethos. The first thing that struck me was the remarkable cleanliness of the hotel; it was immaculate in every way, which is a testament to their dedication to hygiene and their guests comfort. The hotel's team deserves nothing but praise. They were not only efficient but also went above and beyond to make my stay enjoyable. In particular, Novita from the Pier Eight restaurant left a lasting impression. Her professionalism, efficiency, and friendliness were truly outstanding. She is a valuable asset to the hotel, and her exceptional service should be recognised by the hotel management. Overall, my stay at the Intercontinental Sanur Bali was a delightful experience. The exceptional cleanliness, along with the outstanding team, especially Novita, made it a memorable and enjoyable stay. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Bali and I look forward to visiting again."

"134.","Rajdeep singh Shekhawat","32","2024-01-01","3","I’m an Intercontinental hotel ambassador member and as being a member I can make the early checkin but Hotel not allowed early check-in. and same thing happened to me while checking out the hotel being an ambassador member I’m supposed to checkout at 4 P.M. but the hotel staff said due to non availability of room I had to check out before 1 P.M. I received two time call to make the early checkout. While I was checking out the hotel the receptionist asked me to checkout all the rooms. I was very upset with the unprofessional behaviour and I checked out all the rooms early and stay 3 hours beach side Restaurant with friends and family member, because we pre booked our car for next destination at 04:00PM. During the stay I faced many inconveniences in my hotel room. As soon as I checked in there was a water log in the bathroom sink due to hair stuck, the complementary fruits kept in my room had ants inside there and the room curtain was not working and I had to call the maintenance staff twice to fix it and in bathroom lots of hair stuck so water was not draining. This was the worst ever experience of mine at any Intercontinental hotel . I do not expect such unprofessional services from you even after I being an ambassador member. I want compensation for the problems I faced. If I face such things its better I switch to other hotel chain next time because I had to get embarrassed in front of my colleagues staying with me at that time. Let me know the best possible that you do. Manager told me send us this experience and inconvenience to our team we will be figured out best way for this situation and I send it emails and WhatsApp msg also few time , still waiting! No one response yet. Really bed experience."

"138.","Franka Amalia","6","2023-01-01","2","We stayed here at the end of May 2022 for the 2nd times. The 1st time was before Intercontinental took over the hotel. We thought things will be better by now but no. The same issue occurred, the aircon was not working properly. Our room temperature stucked at 23c, they moved us 3 times. Because the other room has the same conditions and even worst, one of the room they moved us to had a broken door (balcony door) that creaked everytime there’s a wind coming. So the last room we chose was a downgrade (we booked the ocean view and the only room that has the best temperature that they offer was at the garden view) so we took it anyway because it’s already midnight and we’re so tired to keep moving our stuffs here and there (not to mention the wet clothes we have to carry everytime). This hotel has a great potential if they take care of it and please remember that small things matter. We love the restaurant piereight, the breakfast was amazing. The ambience was great, even if in some spots of the hotel looked like abandoned. If they put more effort to take care of everything, we will definitely come back. But before that sorry to give this 5 stars hotel a 2 stars."

"147.","THE Mithrandir09","41","2024-01-01","1","Stay away from this hotel bar. Ridiculously overpriced cocktails, which mostly just taste of strong alcohol. For that mind of money you can get world class cocktails in Europe. This review is for the beachside bar only but I couldn't find that on google maps. Edit(because I cannot seem to reply), cocktail names as recalled from memory: Barracuda(first cocktail on the menu) just tasted strongly of alcohol, and for the amount of rum in it, the rums taste didn't harmonize with but instead distract from the other ingredients. Either it was too much or the wrong kind of rum. The sabrosa(tequila + jalapeño) was a bit imbalanced with too much salt and I have no clue what that dried orange did in there. I'm no stranger to paying between 10-20€ for a good cocktail and I get that the location influences the price. But these cocktails were overpriced for their taste imo, especially when compared to local pricing."

"164.","Rajnish Agarwal","1","2023-01-01","5","Firstly booked for 5 night in Intercontinental Sanur Bali and the stay had been cool cozy & nice staff, we then cancelled other hotel & extended for another 5 nights. Ms. Yanti Dharma paid special attention for F&B services as we are strictly vegetarian and we always had a chance to see Mr. Alex Molini everyday nicely interacting with Guests in Pier Eight bar & other restaurants. We highly recommend & appreciate style, structure & services Rajnish Agarwal Omsons"
"165.","Sharma Butlers","1","2023-01-01","1","I am just curious, why most of all guests giving worst review? What happened to you Intercontinental? You should take serious action for this matter I plan to go to your hotel in December, but after I read all this review I am afraid will be disappointed. I am sorry to cancel my booking to your hotel. I hope you understand on your condition."

Sampe di lihatin orang dari jauh di kira ada apa.. Saya merasa tidak nyaman sekali.terimakasih.."
"169.","Abidzar Arsha","24","2024-01-01","3","Kamar dengan view pantai yg oke. Tapi jangan berharap seperti pantai di Ayana Grup, pantai nya bukan private beach. Untuk makanan (sarapan) sangat sangat mengecewakan, dgn varian yg sangat sedikit dan mie goreng yg sangat asin. Padahal kelas bintang 5. Kasih bintang 3 dulu yaa."
"170.","John Ollila","24","2023-01-01","1","Checked out early after 12 hours - condition of the room and hotel disgusting. InterContinental Sanur is this hotel's third brand in a decade (Regent & Fairmont) and it is clear that the owner is not willing to put up the capital to keep it up to brand standards. It needs multi million dollar renovation that will take couple of years. It is very unfortunate that InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) had allowed this hotel to carry their namesake brand that it tarnishes. Also, it will affect the InterContinental Bali Jimbaran hotel that is fantastic."
"171.","M AWAD","32","2025-05-01","4","Good one. But if you will just back in the night choose Holiday Inn hotel which is part of the IHG group and it is the next door hotel. You will save money."
"172.","Werner G. Gehring","3","2024-01-01","5","I've been to the Intercontinental Bali Resort six times now. Each one was a special experience. The hotel is unique. The staff as well. I always like to come back."
"173.","Chee Siong Cheng (CS)","906","2023-01-01","4","First time making a booking with IHG. Was pleasanr with the layout of the rooms here giving this a resort feel. Cordless phone batteries aren't working well. Aside from that expect the same level of service in the big boys league. Powerpoint is too deep to plug in an apply mac charger. No usb inputs for direct charging. Well this resort has been here for long so hope the next reno can include these."
"174.","Puguh Budi Susetiyo","305","2024-01-01","5","Pengalaman menginap yg luar biasa di Intercontinental Sanur. Semua bagus. Hal yg tidak nyaman hanya justru dari akses masuknya. Ada oknum yg menjadikan jalan masuk hotel sebagai parkir mobil. Ini membuat jalur 2 arah menjadi tidak nyaman mengingat jalan yg sempit. Semoga hal ini bisa ditingkatkan ke depannya."
"175.","Joy Cao","38","2024-01-01","5","The room is super luxury. Very quiet and relaxing. Great Location. Closer to restaurants, shops and right on the beach. Very friendly staff. Have a lots of selection at breakfast."
