"1.","Reza Soleman","16","2025-12-01","5","I had yet another wonderful stay at Pullman Bandung Grand Central. The service was attentive from start to finish, and as an ALL Gold Member I truly appreciate the warm welcome and room upgrade to a Deluxe City View, the view was amazing. The breakfast was excellent as always, with great variety and quality. The room was clean, comfortable, and well-prepared upon arrival. Special thanks to Ms. Naffa at the front desk for a smooth and informative check-in process, and to the Executive Lounge team for their kind follow-up during my stay. Overall, it was a very pleasant and relaxing experience. Can’t wait to return for another stay soon!"
"2.","Devina Ayu","1","2025-12-11","5","My 7th stay at Pullman Bandung, and always a memorable one. Room is spacious, clean, airy, and very well-designed. I always request the balcony room because of the view and the light. Unfortunately it came with a downside; the room is not soundproofed. This caused me some minor damage to my sleep quality, because Bandung's motorcycle community are always on the run during weekend nights -- imagine the revving sound of big bikes circling around the protocol area -- but all in all, the balcony room is still my favorite -- the noise is paid off by the comfort of other aspects of the room, especially the luxurious amenities. Breakfast spread is top notch. Any dietary options are available. And safe to say, as a pastry fan, the croissant and pan au chocolat here are to die for. Never skip them! I'll definitely come back to my home away from home.."

The food was really good — every meal was delicious and beautifully served. A special shout-out to the Guest Relations team — Feby, Tami, Naffa, Audi, and Rashya — they were all so friendly, attentive, and made me feel truly welcomed throughout my stay. Their warm hospitality made the whole experience even more memorable. Good food, great service, and lovely people — can’t wait to come back!"
"4.","Rakhma Leana","187","2025-12-01","5","Celebrated my birthday month here and they served hospitality at its finest! I requested a birthday setting and we were welcomed by this cute mirror calligraphy and welcome amenities in the room. Moments later they came to our room with another birthday cake! Shoutout to Feby, Tami, Naffa, Audi, and Rashya to deliver such great guest experience. The room is quite spacy and comes with great view of the mountain and the city, which screams Bandung at its best. The location is very strategic which makes it easier for us to move from one spot to the other. The gym is well equipped and properly maintained. We also visited the kid's club which makes our son wants to stay longer than we intended to (we love it so much btw). The food in the restaurant is great too! We grab a late lunch there and the taste also the portion truly fulfill our tummy. All in all it's a great experience and will definitely come back for another pleasant stay."
"5.","Yessika Effendi","2","2025-12-01","5","I came back to this favourite hotel in Bandung, and this stay left me with sweet memory thanks to the special care from the guest relation team and other staff there. I used the upgrade facility to suite room, it was beautiful, spacious and extremely clean. All staff were very friendly and responsive. I was delighted to enter the room that has been decorated for my birthday, then followed by a surprise with a bday greetings and cake. Thankyou to the guest relation staff Feby, Tami, Raffa, Audi and Rashya for the special effort. It was indeed a memorable stay!"
"6.","Margareta Putri","10","2025-11-01","5","Saya menginap di Pullman Bandung Grand Central dengan harapan mendapatkan pengalaman yang menyenangkan sesuai standar hotel bintang lima, namun sayangnya ada beberapa hal yang cukup mengecewakan terkait pelayanan staf. Pertama, saat saya menanyakan ke concierge mengenai lokasi penjemputan Gojek (karena saya sedang menggendong anak dan menggandeng satu anak lagi), saya justru diarahkan untuk turun ke lantai G melalui eskalator sebanyak empat kali. Padahal ternyata ada akses lift yang jauh lebih praktis dan aman. Informasi yang kurang tepat seperti ini cukup merepotkan, apalagi bagi tamu yang membawa anak kecil. Kedua, ketika hendak menuju kids club, saya kembali mengalami ketidaknyamanan. Dalam kondisi menggendong anak dan membawa stroller, saya kesulitan membuka pintu, sementara ada dua staf di area tersebut yang hanya melihat tanpa menawarkan bantuan. Baru setelah saya menyindir, barulah salah satu staf datang membantu. Ketiga , mengenai Kebersihan Karpet Kamar Kondisi karpet di kamar sangat mengecewakan — terlihat kusam dan kotor, seperti sudah lama tidak dicuci atau diganti. Hal ini menimbulkan kesan kurang bersih dan tidak sejalan dengan standar kebersihan hotel bintang lima. Menurut saya, hal-hal seperti ini menunjukkan bahwa hospitality dan kepekaan terhadap kondisi tamu perlu lebih ditingkatkan. Untuk hotel sekelas Pullman, saya berharap staf bisa lebih sigap, ramah, dan proaktif membantu, terutama kepada tamu yang membawa anak atau memiliki kebutuhan khusus. Semoga ke depannya pengalaman tamu bisa lebih baik dan sejalan dengan reputasi Pullman yang terkenal akan pelayanannya. **UPDATE: Sudah ada respon dari pihak hotel yang diwakili oleh Mbak Feby. Pihak hotel telah menyampaikan permintaan maaf, memberikan kamar pengganti , serta menambahkan compliment sebagai bentuk perhatian. Saya menghargai langkah cepat dan sikap profesional yang ditunjukkan. Terima kasih atas tanggapan dan perbaikan yang dilakukan. 🙏 Semoga ke depannya pelayanan yang baik ini dapat terus dipertahankan dan semakin ditingkatkan. 🙏"
"7.","Erik Tan","10","2025-12-18","5","Our stay at Pullman Bandung Grand Central was truly satisfying, thanks to its strategic location, comfortable rooms, and comprehensive amenities. However, what truly impressed us most was the exceptional service provided by the incredibly friendly and professional staff. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Ms. Chani, who guided us through the check-in process with such a smooth and welcoming atmosphere, Ms. Nadiya for her attentiveness throughout our stay, and Ms. Natania (Duty Manager) for her communication and care, ensuring our comfort. All three were invaluable assets that made this experience so special and make us want to return, thankyou very much 🙏"
"8.","Resty Kusumawati","6","2025-11-01","3","Regrettably, I would not be able to recommend Pullman Bandung to my colleagues for future events. I recently organized a 75 participants for a full-day meeting package and 28 participants for halfday meeting in the next day, also 26 rooms for 3 days 2 night. In comparison to other hotels, where a small breakout room is usually provided on a complimentary basis for the organizing committee’s private discussions or calls, we were instead asked to pay an additional fee here, which discouraged us from using the facility. We also considered hosting a dinner at the rooftop, but were informed by the Sales team that it was not possible. They only reccomend their steak restaurant Mad Cow. As a result, we held the dinner elsewhere, which was a missed revenue opportunity for the hotel. Overall, I found several aspects of the service below expectations. The Jakarta Sales team never visited our office to discuss the event details, leaving me to follow up repeatedly. When I conducted a site inspection in Bandung, the Sales representative was not particularly welcoming and did not take the initiative to showcase the meeting spaces. I had to specifically request to see the rooms, and the initial space allocated was in a closed-off corner. Furthermore, during the site inspection, no refreshments were offered. Only after we hinted was plain water served, whereas at other hotels I think it is standard practice to extend a more hospitable gesture, such as offering coffee? Or lunch? I hope this feedback may be helpful in improving the level of service for future clients."
"9.","Brinna Listiani","10","2025-12-01","2","Saya sangat kecewa dengan pelayanan di hotel bintang 5 pullman bandung. Bookingan saya di tiket.com di cancel sepihak oleh pihak hotel pada H- 1 dengan alasan tidak ada jaminan pembayaran. Voucher hotel saya itu pay at hotel, sudah pesan dari bulan mei 2025, kalau butuh deposit ya tinggal hubungi saja ada waktu 6 bulan. Bukan ngehubungin H-1 di JAM 17.15 WIB, LEWAT EMAIL, DAN CUT OFF KONFIRMASI JAM 18.00 WIB jika lewat dari pkl 18 dibatalkan. Ini lewat EMAIL ya sekali lg saya tekankan (memang mau cari kamar cancelan aja). Dan saya telp konfirmasi langsung jam 19.30 begitu tau emailnya, kamar sudah fully booked dan tdk ada solusi dr pihak hotel. Saya memilih hotel pullman krn ada seminar di sana, dan saya msh ada bayi menyusui dmn saya perlu bolak balik ke kamar di waktu waktu tertentu, jd tdk mgkn bs dilakukan jika saya tdk stay di pullman. Oiya solusi pihak hotel saya stay di kamar suite krn itu kamar yg msh available, dengan harga normal. Tentu saja hal ini sangat memberatkan disamping harga yg jauh lebih mahal juga saya dtg hanya utk seminar bukan utk berlibur. Kesalahan dr pihak manajemen tp saya yg hrs d rugikan dgn mengeluarkan budget jauh lbh mahal, jd itu bukan solusi dan pertanggungjawaban yg fair menurut saya. Fast forward, saya cari solusi sendiri dengan mencari cancelan kamar dr teman sejawat kami di hotel ibis lalu pindah ke pullman itupun dr pihak hotel tdk memberikan kemudahan bagi saya utk early check in. Saya harus complain berkali kali spy hotel mengusahakan saya spy bisa early check in menyesuaikan wkt cekout hotel ibis. Kmdn pada saat saya cek in di pullman tdk ada satupun staff yg menemui saya utk membahas masalah ini, ataupun meminta maaf atas ketidaknyamanan yg tlh saya alami. Mungkin krn saya rakyat jelata ya bukan pejabat jadi kalian tidak meresponse complainan saya. Sungguh tidak profesional, dan utk pelayanan sangat kurang utk level hotel bintang 5. Saya tdk merekomendasikan pullman hotel bandung ke sejawat ataupun keluarga saya Oiya disaat ramai orang antri di lift karena ada seminar disitu, petugas hotel hold satu pintu lift krn akan ada pejabat datang shg menyebabkan penumpukan tamu di depan lift. Luar biasa pelayanannya bener bener bintang limaaa (khusus pejabat :) )"

"11.","idriani zulkifli","23","2025-11-01","5","Had a wonderful experience here. Greeted by Yoga at the front desk who was so friendly and helpful. Despite how busy it was because of a wedding on that day, Yoga still treated us really special - like giving us local recommendations. The room was ready immediately. Room is amazing with a huge bed that I reckon can fit 4 people 🤣 Throughout the stay, we were always greeted with smiles and warmth. Thank you for the great hospitality Pullman Bandung! Will definitely be back here for future visits."
"12.","fajar gyta","7","2025-12-01","5","Our first stay at Pullman Bandung with my family was truly unforgettable! The hospitality was exceptional, with all the staff being incredibly friendly and approachable. They would always greet us with a smile and were more than happy to offer assistance whenever we needed it. The kids were thrilled with the surprise from the Guest Service team, thank you Naffa, Feby, Tami, Rashya, and Audi! Pullman Bandung has now become our top choice for accommodation. Thank you to the entire Pullman Bandung team for the outstanding service!"
"13.","Emanuel Febriani","5","2025-11-01","5","My first experience staying at the Pullman Grand Central Bandung Hotel to celebrate my wedding anniversary, and it was a very pleasant experience. The staff was very friendly and I was randomly chosen as the guest of the day…!!! They upgraded my room with the benefit of access to the executive lounge, including afternoon tea and evening cocktails. This will be my unforgettable wedding anniversary gift. Very grateful to the lady whose name I forgot and of course to Pullman Grand Central Bandung for the complimentary. I really appreciate it. I highly recommend the Pullman hotel if you visit Bandung. I will definitely come back to stay at this hotel"
"14.","Fajar Windya","2","2025-12-27","5","pengalaman menginap saya di Pullman Bandung Grandcentral, saya sangat merasa dilayani dengan baik, pelayanan standar hotel bintang lima, dan lain saya sangat kagum dengan dekorasi hotel & room nya, dan yang penting dengan titik lokasi yang berada di tengah kota membuat saya dekat ke mana mana."
"15.","Sadhenna Sayanda","12","2025-12-25","5","Setiap ke Bandung bareng keluarga, aku selalu nginep di Pullman Bandung Grand Central. Kamarnya nyaman & luas, staff ramah, lokasi strategis, dan breakfast-nya enak. Selalu jadi pilihan aman dan favorit buat family stay ✨"
"16.","nur habibah","29","2025-12-11","5","Selalu happy saat stay di pullman bandung grand central, saat turun lobby langsung disambut hangat, dibantu untuk membawa barang, sampai ke kamar, proses check in sangat cepat dan mudah, walaupun hotel sangat ramai tapi semua staff sangat helpfull, kebetulan saya menginap untuk merayakan wedding anniv, jadi diberikan banyak complimentary, untuk kamar sangat nyaman dan bersih, untuk breakfast juga sangat beragam dan lezat, ada sateee yang benar2 baru dibakar didepan kita, terima kasih banyak untuk semua staff, terutama untuk teman2 Guest Relations Feby, Tami, Naffa, Audi, Rashya.

"17.","Erickson H.","4","2025-12-01","5","Had a very enjoyable 2 night stay at this Hotel. There were some questionable room design choices but it was really just nitpicking. Other than that the stay was wonderful. The Executive Lounge was nice although I find the snack selection during the evening cocktail hours quite subpar. We also had the opportunity to try both breakfast venues. The breakfast at the Executive lounge is overall very tasty, while the breakfast buffet at the lobby have way more options, tastes good but nothing spectacular. Hotel facilities are also very complete, especially the fitness center. There is also a Sauna Room but it took forever to get it heated up. Other than that, the hotel is located at the city centre, literally around the main government area. The area is very secure, but your travel will be affected if there are any demonstrations. Overall we had a great time staying here, would stay again should we have the opportunity to. Ps. we really appreciate the anniversary cake provided by the Pullman Team :)"
"18.","aries diana","1","2025-12-25","1","pelayan atas nama Cantika tidak profesional dan sangat tidak ramah. menegur pelayan lain tapi didepan tamu membuat kami merasa tidak nyaman dan tidak dihargai. Pengalaman yang sangat buruk, tidak akan kembali ke hotel ini lagi."
"19.","Dini Dini","5","2025-12-01","5","Breakfast with the view? Pullman never went wrong for the service, food quality, the joy for ambience, and the take away coffee!!!! american and indonesia breakfast are available. The cheese plater is chef kisses! Also, they have signature indonesian food , sushi🥰, dimsum, chocolate fondue, and many more. Please ask the greeter to be able sit at 17th floor, you are very welcome"

"21.","Reyner Gunawan","570","2025-12-01","5","Stayed for a conference during a long weekend. Generally it was a great stay. Check in did take some time due to the crowd and i waited quite long and what could be improved is the fact that no one really manage the queue well so its kinda chaotic and disorganised. Room was great, bed and pillow are comfy. Room was clean and modern. Breakfast was great, so many food options. Location was great, very central. Staffs were friendly. Gym was one of the best ive ever been in a hotel. Pool was rather small tho. Parking is not a problem even it was crowded, they have huge parking space and seems like we always manage to find a spot although sometimes its far from the elevator."

"24.","Jessillama","174","2025-12-01","4","Very nice hotel, superb breakfast. Gym facilities are very good. Rooms are comfy although the bed is needlessly big (2.4 m). AC had no temperature control, it keep cooling down below the set temperature."
"25.","Diandra Xandrine","21","2025-12-01","4","Reservasi di sini sempat ada hiccups. Dari segi booking dan check-in service-nya HARUS terus di improve lagi!

"26.","Syed Ismail","3","2025-11-01","5","It was a very nice stay, got upgraded as we checked in. Amenities and food was good. Especially the gym and pool! As for location wise, its really near shopping districts and cafes would stay here again for sure. Also, front desk employee named Yoga, was super hospitable to my wife and I which I really appreciate. He helped us out with our itinerary as it was our first time in bandung. Give him a raise he was a very big help!"

"28.","Edo Jonathan Chandra","394","2025-11-01","5","We have a staycation with family for the kids term breaks holiday and also for my daughter birthday. so we stay here and the services are awesome. shout out to Feby, Tami, Naffa, Audi, Rashya from guest relations for surprising my daughters and delivering some cakes. it's an enjoyable stay here. room is spacious on the junior suite and great hospitality, the only concern that we have is we had the time there during the practice training of their alarm for fire, so we had wait inside the room and can't use the elevator for almost 2 hours which actually not so easy for the kids... guess we are not in good luck on that day. the breakfast varieties is awesome and overall the stay is super only can't get maxed 10/10 because of the fire drill..."
"29.","Rozma Suhardi","8","2025-10-01","1","Nginap 4 malam di kamar junior sweet yang semalam seharga 5 jt tp sangat kecewa dgn kebersihannya. kamar bau toilet. lalu banyak debu meskupin sdh di info kalau tolong di vacum lbh baik lg. tapi pas sy cek kembali debunya masih bnyk bahkan sisa2 rambut org yang nginap sblmnya masih ada. akhrinya sy panggil cleaning service kembali buat membersihkan, sy panggil mereka dan sy ambil tisu basah dan ngelapin bawah meja dan lantai yg bnyk sisa rambut tp ttp aja bilamg kita sdh vacum. akhirnya dia bawa org buat vacum kembali dgn alasan vacumnya yg kurang nyedot. nggak paham dgn alasan yg nggak masuk akal. lalu sy kembali ke receptionis bertanya apa setiap kamar yg habis dibersiin di cek kembali ama manger km, katanya di cek. tp masa klo di cek hasilnya masih kotor. tolong kedepannya lbh diperhatikan lg kebersihannya."
"30.","Fajar Agung Firmansyah","3","2025-10-01","5","Our family had such a wonderful stay at Pullman Bandung! The breakfast was truly delightful with so many tempting options to choose from. The staff were super friendly and made us feel right at home. The location is unbeatable, just steps away from Bandung’s best culinary spots and shopping centers. Our room was spacious, spotless, and very comfortable. We also loved the excellent facilities, from the gym to the swimming pool, everything was just perfect. Honestly, we can’t wait to come back and stay here again!"
"31.","Zahra Kartika","3","2025-12-25","5","A good experience stay here for 3 nights. Just small insight need to add more food variant both for breakfast and lunch meeting. And thanks to Mas Yusuf who help from teh concierge. Thank you"

"33.","Ijoy Hatta","40","2025-12-01","5","Untuk desain dan kenyamanan di hotel, tidak perlu diragukan lagi utk Pullman. Cuma disayangkan Kolam renang agak kecil untuk sekelas Pullman. Dan tidak ada view. Paling berkesan bagi saya dan keluarga adalah saat sarapan. Bertemu dengan staff bernama Mbak Fitri amat membuat kami terkesan baik dg pelayanan dan tanggap dalam melayani kami. Terima Kasih buat Mbak Fitri atas pelayanan luar biasa ramah dan tulusnya. Dan Mas Rizal di area juice bar terima kasih banyak juga ya. Semoga makin banyak staff yg terinspirasi seperti mereka. Good job!!!"
"34.","Jaya Saputra","13","2025-10-01","5","From arriving until the time we're about to check out, it was exquisite experience. Top notch. Two best part of all is basically all in bathroom (strong shower, super nice shampoo and gel) and also the breakfast. Both the service and food was superb. Black coffee is among the best in town and also during breakfast, Arfian keep delivering the best and surprising service. Top notch!"

Special thanks to Mr Garuda and Mr Lalan from the concierge team who went above and beyond in their work and attend to my request even outside of shifts."
"37.","Ian Darton","5","2025-08-01","5","Second time staying in this hotel. Spend around 350 days a year in hotels and have to say, this one is possibly the best hotel I stay at. The whole team here are fantastic. Warm welcomes and friendly people which for me is the most important part of the stay. Little messages in the room, a welcome message on the mirror in the bathroom all add to the warm welcomes. The rooms are lovely and clean, food in the restaurant was absolutely divine and the breakfast was fantastic. A special thank you to Sinatra who was so helpful and friendly at breakfast and Feby from Guest Relations who is one of the nicest people I have ever met. I absolutely love this hotel!!!"
"38.","Vega Theresia","10","2025-12-11","5","Pengalaman yang sangat menyenangkan tinggal di pullman bandung grand central. Kamar sangat nyaman, lokasi strategis, dan pelayanan yang sangat sigap. Terutama untuk tim guest relation nya dengan Feby, Tami, Naffa, Audi, dan Rashya karena sudah membantu saya turut merayakan ulang tahun suami. Terimakasih"
"39.","Khadyjah","38","2025-11-01","4","Agak kecewa dengan kamarnya. Tidak sesuai dengan ekspektasi (padahal waktu nginap dapat harga kamar yg lumayan mahal sekitar 3jt/malam). Smart TVnya ketinggalan zaman (tidak bisa netflix/disney/dll). Karpet kamar juga kotor sekali. Wastafel harus dicongkel dulu penutup lubangnya (tuasnya tdk berfungsi lagi), dan gantungan handuk di kamar mandi sudah miring2 longgar. Sayang sekali padahal hotelnya lumayan baru. Semoga bisa diperbaiki kualitasnya agar sesuai dengan standar bintang 5. Terimakasih."
"40.","Ashiva Aulia","6","2025-10-01","3","Good location and hotel rooms — bad service especially on check in journey/experience. Very unpleasant and you know what ? This experience will be a benchmark for me to decide if I will stay here again or not in the future. 1. Had to wait for almost AN HOUR for the rooms to be ready (based on my previous experience, I had to call the hotel first to request for check-in earlier but still have it at around 2 PM but this time I’m checking in at 2 PM just to have the room ready 45+ mins later). Totally disappointing. 2. The queue for check-in was TERRIBLE (at some point some random ladies could cut your Q). This is a top hotel but the customer journey is disappointing and not ideal. 3. Train your front liners, the ones at the lobby, to be more friendly with better hospitality. If you need more staff to handle much traffic of guest, then add it during those period of time. During my waiting time for my room, it wasn’t easy to ask to the staff, nobody stands by to serve the waiting guest or at least be there to be asked. Not to mention due to point 2 above, I only needed information on my room prep but no one is there ready to be asked AND a random old lady cut the Q. The lobby is your first guest touch point at the hotel and it’s important to give good experience. Remember also: you’re offering hospitality as you run this business. Make it a priority. Consider check-in process as the onboarding part, I could say this early step of check-in/onboarding was totally unpleasant and unacceptable for a so called 5 stars hotel. Please evaluate and fix this."

Kamar nya nice bgt. Breakfast agak sedikit kurang variasi tetapi utk taste enak dan pelayanan resto jg cpt.. hanya 1 kekurangannya yaitu kolam renang kuang besar, overall akan kembali lagi saat berlibur ke Bandung.. Terima kasih Pullman Bandung dan team Guest Relations.. GBU all"
"58.","Yoga Rahiyang","13","2025-09-01","5","I just had my third stay at Pullman Bandung Grand Central for a business trip, and honestly, it keeps getting better every time. The breakfast is always a highlight, a huge variety with authentic flavors that taste amazing, easily one of the best hotel breakfasts I’ve ever had. Service throughout was fast, smooth, and made everything feel completely hassle-free. What truly stood out, though, was the people behind it, especially the Concierge, Lalan, and Gilang. both worked pure magic when I suddenly needed a birthday bouquet, managing to have it beautifully arranged and delivered in just 30 minutes, while both of them impressed me with their genuine care and thoughtful recommendations. It reminded me that real hospitality is all about the human touch, knowing what guests need and creating moments that stay in the heart. Thanks to them, my stay was not just comfortable but truly memorable, and Pullman Bandung Grand Central will always be at the top of my list whenever I visit Bandung."

"64.","Karel K. Himawan","283","2025-09-01","4","Super excited to stay here for a business trip, especially after reading the reviews. We arrived in what couldn’t be worse timing as riots happening just outside the hotel, but the staff made every effort to ensure we had access. The lobby and hospitality met our expectation. The hotel was connected to conference building and another hotel of the same Accor group. There was welcome snacks prepared in our room, which is appreciated. No mini bar was provided in the room. The room is overall convenient, but fell under our expectation esp. related to cleanliness. A cockroach was spotted in the cap of water bottle in the early morning. We also feel that bathroom area could have been cleaner. Coffee machine was not well-functioned. I suspect the water tube needs cleaning. Issues teported to front staff as we checked out."
"65.","Novita Indah (-)","21","2025-08-01","5","Menginap di sini sebenarnya salah satu wishlist aku. Hotel ini punya fasilitas mewah dan lokasinya super strategis. Sebelum mencoba Pullman, aku pernah menginap di Ibis Styles yang letaknya persis sebelahan, jadi aku cukup familiar dengan area dan suasananya. Kami menginap untuk merasakan tahun baru dibandung. Dari segi kamar dan fasilitas, memang nggak bisa dipungkiri—semuanya terasa nyaman dan sesuai dengan harga yang dibayarkan. Tapi sayangnya, pengalaman menginap kali ini sedikit mengecewakan karena ada kejadian yang kurang menyenangkan terkait pelayanan. Sepertinya ada miskomunikasi antara staf di bawah dengan tim di executive lounge. Meskipun mereka cukup cepat merespons keluhan kami, rasa kecewanya tetap ada—terutama karena kejadian ini cukup membekas untuk saya dan suami. Jadi, jujur saja, untuk sekarang saya belum tertarik kembali ke sini. Tapi mudah-mudahan pengalaman saya ini hanya kebetulan, dan ke depannya ada perbaikan dalam koordinasi pelayanan di Pullman. But overall selain dari kejadian tersebut, saya kasih bintang 5."

The hospitality shown by all staff from the first time I arrived until check-out on the next day was good and professional. However, I had a minor problem in my room. The bedside lamp switch on the left side of the bed was broken, so I had to unplug it manually from the socket to turn off the lamp at night. Above all, I’m satisfied staying at Pullman Grand Central."

"71.","Farid Herman","162","2025-11-01","1","SEVERE SECURITY BREACH - Room Door Left Wide Open, No Safety Protocols Enforced On September 7, 2025, I returned to Room 932 at Pullman Bandung Grand Central after a full day out, only to discover my door WIDE OPEN - left completely unsecured by housekeeping after cleaning. This isn't a minor oversight; this is a catastrophic failure of basic hotel security. Critical Failures Exposed: - No double-check mechanism after housekeeping service - No supervisor verification of room security - Complete absence of the maker-checker process that should be standard - Management's failure to implement basic safety protocols All of my personal belongings were exposed to anyone could possibly passing. While fortunately nothing was stolen after I checked, imagine if I were a solo female traveler and someone with malicious intent had entered and waited inside? The liability and danger created is immense. I expected Accor, as a global hospitality leader, to maintain operational and security standards comparable to Marriott, Hilton, or Kempinski. This incident proves otherwise. If housekeeping can leave doors wide open with no verification process, what other safety measures are being ignored? Duty Manager Wirianto attempted to handle the situation that evening by providing CCTV recording from when I left the room until I came back. He also offering fruit platters and future stay compensation. I declined both compensation - when paying premium rates, I expect premium security, not apologies and freebies after a serious breach. I came to know the General Manager name was Dominique Albero and he should be aware that his property has failed at the most fundamental level of hospitality - keeping guests safe. In my view, this isn't about one housekeeper's mistake. This is about: - Systemic failure in operational procedures - Absence of team-based safety checks - Management not implementing proper oversight - Prioritizing efficiency over security I will not stay at any Pullman property worldwide after this incident. Ironically, I'll still choose Raffles (also Accor chain) after experiencing exceptional service at Raffles Makkah Palace in July 2024 - proving this is a Pullman Bandung management problem, not an Accor-wide issue. This incident requires corporate intervention. One property's negligence damages your entire brand reputation."

Saat tanya untuk menu anak diarahkan ambil telur dan sosis. Hari kedua gulai kambing. Saat tanya sama chef dibilang hanya itu, bisa pesen telur. Lalu chef bilang “sebentar saya tanyakan ke belakang” saya ngga tau tanya apa yang jelas he didn’t come back to me. Lokasi breakfast juga sangat terbatas. Bisa breakfast di lantai 17 tapi menu buffet ada di area smoking. Seriously? Kids club cukup besar dan bersih. Tp saat anak saya kesana tidak ada mainan yg bisa dimainkan. Hanya ada tv menyala dan mewarnai. Karpet di kamar juga butuh maintenance. Sudah gampang brudul bgt sehingga menyebabkan debu-debu. Harga hanya untuk lokasi saja.

Thank you to the amazing team at Pullman Hotel Bandung for making my stay so special. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Bandung, and I’m already looking forward to my next visit! If I had to mention one downside, it would be the bidet water pressure and leakage from the toilet bowl in the bathroom. The rest is beyond fabulous!"

The room was spacious and comfortable, and the service was excellent. Breakfast was a highlight, with two restaurant options; I chose the one on the 17th floor, which offered a stunning city view and a delicious, varied buffet. Everything was well thought out, making the overall experience truly enjoyable."

The breakfast on our first day was quite chaotic; the area was overwhelmingly crowded, making it difficult to find seating and enjoy the meal. However, I was thoroughly impressed by how the hotel staff addressed our concerns. I want to give special recognition to Agus, who handled our complaint with exceptional professionalism and friendliness. He and the team went above and beyond to rectify the situation, providing us with extra attention and a thoughtful complimentary gesture for the remainder of our stay. Their commitment to guest satisfaction turned a disappointing experience into a very positive one. It’s this level of service recovery that truly defines a great hotel. Thank you, Agus, for your outstanding hospitality!"

"151.","R Besthadi Sukmono","9","2025-10-01","5","Great hotel situated right in the center of Bandung. Gasibu field is right in front of the hotel, and next to Gedung Sate and Museum Geologi. The cafes and shops of Riau street are right across the street. The room was great, they even cater to our daughter birthday by giving us a free upgrade in the corner room, cakes, and a hand drawn birthday card in the mirror. Comfortable bed, great pillow and spectacular view. The breakfast is amazing, with many delicious food to choose from. But unfortunately the restaurant was not big enough so the queue was too much so we have to be moved upstairs to the 18th floor, the Mad Cow Restaurant. Although the place was superb with great view, but we have to wait for a few moments to get our order made. So we have to plan our plan accordingly for that day. Special shoutout to the team at reception and guest service: Feby, Tami, Naffa, Audi, and Rashya for catering our stay."

And things got better from there. Impressive hospitality from Mba Febi and Mas Yoga who took me by surprise with the gift of Snapdragon flower bouquet and delicious dark chocolate mousse cake when I checked in. And of course, not forgetting my decorated room with complimentary local snacks (jajanan). With these warm gestures of welcome, they are definitely worth more than 5 stars! The hotel is highly recommended and definitely will be my priority list whenever I'm in Bandung."

Terutama keadaan kamar mandinya yang berkerak dan keadaan handuk yang sudah compang camping pada saat saya check in. Ini tidak sepantasnya ada di hotel bintang 5 sekelas Pullman. This’ll sure be our last visit, sorry."

"183.","bramastha ogy rosadi","3","2025-08-01","5","A heartfelt thank you to the entire team at Pullman Bandung Grand Central for the exceptional hospitality during my family’s stay. There are a few points that I believe could be areas for improvement: 1. The variety and flavor of the breakfast offerings felt rather standard. It would be great to see more diversity and refinement in the quality of the dishes. 2. The swimming pool size also felt a bit small considering the scale and capacity of the hotel. On the other hand, several aspects truly stood out in a positive way: 1. The snacks served in the lounge were surprisingly delicious and became one of the highlights of our stay. 2. The service at the lounge was warm and personal—especially from Ms. Chani, who welcomed us via WhatsApp even before check-in. She also kindly arranged for a delightful welcome fruit platter and chocolate cake, which were thoughtfully delivered by Ms. Feby, Tami, Naffa, Audi, and Rashya. They also surprised my nephew with a lovely little gesture that meant a lot to him and created a lasting memory. Ms. Chani was also very helpful in assisting me with a late check-out, even though I had forgotten to request it during check-in. Once again, thank you and all the best to Ms. Natania, the Duty Manager, and the entire Pullman Bandung Grand Central team. Wishing you continued success, and I look forward to staying with you again in the future."

"195.","Y. Rust.","74","2025-08-01","3","Sorry PULLMAN, you disappointed me this time. I'm at some tiers in ACCOR level and supposed to be eligible for both early check in AND late check out. One day before my arrival, from lounge contacted me and i mention i will arrive there about 12.00 noon, and they reply me they will try to accomodate readiness of my room, but can't guarantee. Okay. On the day, i arrived at 13.15 and check in and, my room is not ready yet. I remind them, i need to go out again in 15 min due to some custoner meeting. So they try, after 20 min i got my room with the reason they are moving the welcome aminities (cakes, etc) from the other room to the room now i was assigned. Since i was too busy and tired to complaint, that welcome aminites cakes and card never arrive at my room until the moment i check out. The bedsheet also got some grey stain but i just realize almost midnight when i want to go sleep, which is toooo tired to complaint While asking for a mineral water, they told me it is limited 4 additional water bottle for a day and i exceed it already; so i'll just go down to the gym and do refill it from there. I share all of this exoeriences to the woman at the executive lounge and expect you to improve. It used to be not like this, visited here almost once in 4-6 month in the last 3 years. But this time is worst one. Oh PULLMAN, this is really not a five star service. Please improve yourself and be better. I wish it happends by the time i come back there."

Rooms and facilities are very dated but well maintained. Room is big, but has a weird layout. Being the tallest building in the surrounding, views is unobstructed. However, as it is right next to a main road and the sound proof windows are non existence, it can get quite noisy at night. Not alot of facilities to speak of. Only two treadmill in the gym, and small swimming pool."

"235.","Widyaningtyas Putri Nugroho","1","2025-07-01","5","I had an absolutely lovely stay and wanted to thank the team for making it extra special. I truly appreciated the complimentary room upgrade—it was comfortable, and beautifully maintained. Thank you kak Febby for making this happen! The amenities provided were nice, a special thank you for the surprise cake in the room given by the Guest Experience team—a sweet and unexpected gesture! I loved the mirror decorations too. Afternoon tea and the evening cocktail were equally enjoyable, offering a nice snacks and quality. Everyone at the Lounge was so friendly— kak Chani and the rest of the team (the nametag was quite small I cant see right, sorry!). Breakfast was another highlight: tasty with plenty of options to choose from. I personally love the lamb and beef satay, and the bread pudding. The service throughout was warm and attentive (Cynthia at the Reception, everyone at the Concierge, and door greeters too). Overall, a memorable experience that I would happily recommend and hope to repeat soon."
"236.","William Kartawidjaja","39","2025-08-01","5","Celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary in the city of Bandung was made more special when we decided to stay at the Pullman hotel. They're very accomodating with my special request of making a surprise for my wife for our 25th wedding anniversary with a nice special decor for our room. Thank you to the team at Pullman, Feby, Tami, Naffa, Audi, Rashya who's part of making our stay a special one!"
"237.","Ardikarizky21","41","2025-07-01","5","Definitely good location. I booked and stayed at the executive lounge access room and wasn’t as much as I expected. The staff were all great and super helpful! Thanks to everyone at the lounge very kind and genuine ladies also the bartender at your rooftop bar. Unfortunately the products do not represent well as the staff were truly wonderful. A couple things I would like to point out; 1. A/C hard to control not very cold enough and just stuck at the same Temperature. Only gets colder in early morning. Not sure if this something to do with saving cost? Because executive lounge aircon is cold and just perfect. 2. I booked executive lounge access to enjoy my private time and unfortunately breakfast was served at the Main Resto during weekdays and I had to seat in a dirty table and super crowded environment in which I intend to avoid by booking a lounge access. 3. presentation during evening cocktail. Honestly theres nothing much to be commented as there’s nothing were significant, not even the alcohol beverages were presented as a showcase and it was seating at the back area. I know it is on the menu but it would be nice to have it presented. Only Light snacks and looks like frozen food after all. 4. Very uncomfortable pillows for a premium hotel. Overall, it is such an unfortunate that you have a wonderful staff but not the product. That is something that you can change (maybe) and surely this hasn’t change since day 1 i tried this hotel when it first opened as I still see the same problem. I think this pullman grand central is just not for me. I don’t expect anything I was just sharing this for a future improvement (maybe). Again, I do not have complain regarding the service which is the main point of hospitality. Everyone who I encountered were all very nice and helpful. Thank you"

From the moment we arrived, we were warmly welcomed by Ms. Cynthia at the reception, who provided such a friendly, professional, and heartfelt service. The Reservation team even surprised us by upgrading our room to one with a beautiful view overlooking Lapangan Gasibu Bandung, which made our stay even more special. A very special thank you to Ms. Feby and Ms. Tami from the Guest Relations team, who personally came to our room with a beautiful anniversary dessert and a heartfelt wishes to us. Their thoughtful surprise and sincere wishes created a wonderful, personal touch that truly made our celebration memorable. Another highlight came from the Housekeeping team, who prepared a lovely surprise inside the room by writing an anniversary message on our mirror — complete with a fun caricature drawing of the two of us! It was such a creative, thoughtful gesture that made us smile and feel genuinely appreciated. Overall, Pullman Grand Central Bandung doesn’t just offer luxury and comfort, but also genuine warmth and hospitality. Huge thanks to Ms. Cynthia Reception, Ms. Feby, Ms. Tami from Guest Relation team, and the Housekeeping team for making our 10th anniversary stay truly perfect. We’ll absolutely be coming back and highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to celebrate a special moment in Bandung."

So kuddos also to mngmnt n HR n etc on back office to maintain n support that. Rooms also top notch; clean, spacious, all amenities works. Yoga mat, some dumbell, coffee pods, extra mugs n glasses, plenty of nice n considerate touches here n there. Parking is not an issue, despite its a problem almost everywhere throughout Bandung city hotspot. Great location, best to roam Bandung Cons: no cons, hard pressed to find one... Maybe the pool a bit on the small side (beautifully staged though) also no warm water pool, n also the equipment on gym could be expanded, but thats a mere suggestion.. Overall: awesome experience, will definitely visit again"

"355.","Fendy Setiawan","12","2025-10-01","5","Been to this hotel several times but I could say this is the best experience I've had in Pullman Bandung. The attention from each staff starting before we arrive until we depart is nothing to compare of. We received our pre-arrival arrangement in advance which gives us comfort knowing everything is prepared. Upon arrival we are greeted by a team of staffs who were very welcoming and ensured that everything is taken care of. The room was big, comfortable with separate toilets and shower facility. Water pressure and temperature was amazing, so no need to worry on unstable pressure / temperature. The room itself was clean, complete amenities, comfortable bed and great pillows, to ensure that you will wake up refreshed on the next day or just stay comfort on the bed. They also provided yoga mat and pair of dumbbells to stay fit. TV channels were complete for both locals, movies and internationals. Facilities like gym and pool is available but did not try. Breakfast was amazing selection, I would really recommend their Satay which are delicious., hope they can add more selections in the executive lounge. All the staffs were really great in making sure our comfort and would go beyond our needs, my biggest appreciation to Chani, Henrieta, Euis, Lintang, Silvia and also the team in the executive lounge for taking care us during our stay, from the moment we booked our stay, during the lounge activities and also the moment we requested for a late check out, all were amazing and really exceeds our expectations, Kudos to all. I would recommend to stay at the executive room as it is really convenient and included with afternoon tea and good evening cocktails."

Room size quite bigger than we expected, I love the room& bathroom layout. Unfortunately on the first night somehow the room had sewerage smell quite strong around 3am in the morning and when we went to the lower floor where wine store was they also have the same exact smell on that floor, we informed the reception and without hesitation they moved us to another room which was nice room too tho we noticed the wall in the toilet side was leaking water whenever we shower. We ate here for breakfast, there were a lot of variety of food they even have fresh satay for breakfast which was the highlight for our breakfast. Staff are all very friendly. It’s a nice hotel with great city centre location but we think when they built this hotel they could’ve done better on details of water leaking and such considering this is new built hotel."

The property's central location, situated in the heart of the city center, was a significant advantage. As an Accor member, I was delighted to receive a room upgrade, further enhancing my experience. The staff at the executive lounge provided exceptional service, demonstrating a genuine commitment to guest satisfaction. Their attentiveness to detail was commendable. The room itself was meticulously maintained, exceeding expectations for cleanliness. Finally, the check-in and check-out processes were commendably efficient, minimizing wait times. Overall, my stay was exemplary, and I look forward to returning to your establishment in the future."
"402.","Allen Wen","176","2025-01-01","5","Modern hotel with amazing amenities! It has an awesome gym facility basically gym junkie's play ground! Breakfast serves a good variety, often too much to choose from. The rooms are modern and well designed. The executive lounge afternoon tea and evening cocktail is a bliss, definitely another plus point! It's definitely a creme de la creme of the hotels in Bandung! Now back to the downside, this is clearly a very popular hotel but the reception check in is slow and dragging. I queued almost 30min and was eventually helped, the receptionist forgot to activate my card for lounge access and i ended up again in the waiting line. Hopefully with this long waiting addressed, a well deserved 10 for this great hotel."

Interior kamar modern dengan aksen kayu yang aesthetic banget. Amenities-nya juga sangat lengkap. Sayang lantai PVC/vinyl kayunya sudah tidak rata sehingga bikin kagok dan tidak nyaman saat jalan. Bantal ada 4, tapi yang 2 terasa keras sekali bikin sakit leher. Wifi putus nyambung padahal provider saya sering hilang sinyal saat berada di kamar. Pesan G-food juga harus ambil ke “lobby G” yang beda gedung dari hotel ini dan jaraknya cukup jauh. Harusnya boleh dititip di lobby utama atau bagian concierge agar memudahkan tamu. Kolam renang kecil, ada beberapa mainan di sekitar kolam renang tapi ga nemu kids club-nya. Dari semua hotel Pullman mungkin hotel ini yang terasa kurang “luas”. Breakfast ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ no complain, varian banyak dan rasa enak semua. Overall, it was still a wonderful experience staying in this hotel."

Baru kali ini saya melihat layanan hotel pullman bintang 5 yang sangat mengecewakan padahal rate harganya 2,8++jt/mlm. Dan pada saat saya mau tidur spreinya+bed covernya gatal akhirnya saya buka semua sprei dan saya kibas2 semua. Setelah itu lantai terasa berdebu(debu dari sprei). Saat sarapan..sarapannya sangat tidak enak, sedikit variasi padahal itu hari weekend..hanya ada nasi,nasi putih,bihun goreng,sayur hijau,ayam rica klo tidak salah. Tahu goreng tepungnya keras bgt, siomay terlalu benyek, mie ayam krg enak, sate daging agak keras. Padahal biasanya saya menikmati makan di hotel pullman dmn saja.

Oh satu lg, welcome drink pun tak ada. Kalah dgn hotel bintang 2 n 3 yg pasti ada welcome drink. Untung staff ramah."

Bukannya malah pelayanan ditingkatkan ini justru makin kesini makin turun kualitasnya. Ga sesuai dgn rate kamar. So disapppointing."
"456.","widya","59","2022-01-21","1","Kamar : Nginep 3 hari 2 malam di kamar king size city view. Kamar kecil sekali tidak sampai 40 meter, dengan kondisi kolong ranjang dan sofa berdebu tebal. Hand towel jg tidak disediakan. Hny diksi 2 handuk mandi. Service : Pelayanan sangat tidak profesional. Dtg jam 15 mau cek in kamar belum ready, tunggu 30 menit itu jg harus kita yg tny lg ke resepsionis sudah ready atau belum. Mereka tidak ada inisiatif tlp untuk info ke kita. Padahal di lobby yg antri cek in banyak, masa kita harus antri lgi untuk cek kamar. Di lobby pas dtg jg tidak ada yg bukain pintu mobil atau tny apa ada koper yg mau dibawa. Bellboynya pura2 ga liat dan sibuk ngobrol. Sampai sopir saya harus muter dulu karena lobby kecil dan mobil yg dtg bnyk. 👎👎 fasilitas : kolam renang super kecil, ga cocok untuk nginep bawa anak. Fasilitas ga sesuai dengan kapasitas tamu"
"457.","Arhmey Priasetiawan","5","2022-01-21","1","Hotel bintang 5 tp kualitas kaki 5. Pertama datang di hotel, tidak ada bell boy yang membantu membawakan koper, penjaga pintu dan satpam pun sangat pasif tidak ada inisiatif sama sekali. Saat jam sarapan pagi yg penuh, pelanggan menunggu lumayan lama dikarena kapasitas resto tidak memadai, harusnya pihak hotel sudah bisa memprediksi untuk kapasitas resto dan jumlah pelanggan yang menginap. Untuk ukuran hotel bintang 5, kolam renangnya tidak ada istimewa sama sekali, malahan seperti kualitas hotel bintang 3. Kolam renang terlalu kecil. Sangat2 kecewa meninginap di hotel ini. Tidak sesuai dengan harga yg harus dibayarkan."
"458.","Ilona Salutan","5","2022-01-21","1","Harga yang tidak sebanding dengan service yang diberikan. 1.) Kami sampai Bandung lebih awal dari rencana, kami ke Pullman untuk registrasi check in terlebih dahulu. Namun, Staff FO tidak menyambut kami dengan baik dan akhirnya Staff tsb meminta semua KTP orang yang menginap di tiap kamar yang telah sy booking. Setelah dipersulit dengan meminta KTP setiap orang (total ada 8 org), staff FO baru menginformasikan tdk bisa registrasi saat itu dan hanya bisa registrasi persis sebelum jam check in. Di hotel dengan bintang jauh lebih kecil tidak seribet ini untuk registrasi check in, dan dimana2 cukup registrasi 1 KTP saja mewakili seluruh kamar. 2.) Sy telah menginfokan dari jauh2 hari sebelum sampai Bandung bahwa sy minta semua kamar Twin Bed dan sy juga sdh menginformasikan ke 2 staff FO yg berbeda pd jam berbeda. Di jam pertama yang mau registrasi check in tapi batal (poin 1) dan di malam akhirnya saya check in. Namun setelah sy masuk kamar sekitar jam 19.00, sy dpt laporan bahwa ada 2 kamar teman kerja saya yang King Bed. Sy telfon ke FO sampai 3x tapi tdk diangkat, akhirnya sy turun ke FO lobby. Setelah memberi tahu ke staff FO yang bertugas, staff bilang di sistem sudah Twin Bed, walaupun pada kenyataannya bukan. Staff FO juga masih sempat nanya apakah kamar sudah dipakai, walaupun akhirnya diganti kamar dan proses ganti kamar sangat lama. 3.) Setiap malam kami mengisi form breakfast untuk diantar ke kamar dengan rincian nomor kamar, nama, jumlah orang yang breakfast dan special request. Namun saat breakfast datang selalu tidak sesuai dengan form yang kami isi selama 3 malam kami menginap. Antar department di Pullman juga tidak bekerjasama dengan baik, sy minta untuk kamar dibersihkan namun piring bekas breakfast tidak diangkut sekalian. Di hari berikutnya juga tidak ada staff untuk clear up piring bekas breakfast dan seharusnya scr logika dibersihkan karena kami semua hanya dapat breakfast di kamar. 4.) Saat check out, saya minta invoice terpisah untuk setiap kamar. Di invoice yang sy terima, ada nama yang salah dan sy minta revisi. Staff FO masih bertanya nama yang benar spt apa dan asal nomor kamar dengan cukup ketus. Bukannya sudah ada di database sistem hotel berhubung kami semua kasih KTP saat check in? Padahal di invoice tsb juga ada nomor kamar dan nama lengkap. Walaupun kamarnya nyaman dan lokasi strategis, dengan pelayanan seperti ini dan masih ada beberapa yang tidak saya sebut saya rasa tidak sepadan untuk menginap di sini."

"460.","deasy desmita","4","2022-01-21","1","Untuk hotel sekelas bintang 5 pullman ini tidak recommend. Pengalaman 2x stay di Pullman Bandung (selama 4 hari) : - Proses check in 14.00-17.00 menunggu connecting room yang seharusnya sudah mendapat confirmasi dari jauh hari. - Tim front line tidak polite saat ditanyakan konfirmasi (perempuan), (laki-laki) hanya bisa minta maaf tanpa memberikan kepastian menunggu berapa lama. - Barang-barang diantarnya diatas 1 jam kemudian setelah masuk kamar. Masuk kamar 17.00, barang datang 18.10 - Request semprot desinfektan tidak datang (Ruangan tidak wangi) - Request antar makanan tidak datang - Hand towel tidak ada, sudah request juga tidak datang. - Telp front line sulit sekali - Request perbaikan kursi disabilitas yang copot sendiri/ rusak tidak datang teknisinya (ditoilet ada kursi disabilitas) - Kolam renang infonya dibatas per 1 jam untuk bookingan, nyatanya gabung dengan bookingan lain (sehingga ramai) dan tidak ada sortiran. - Proses check out, menunggu trolley untuk membawa barang lama sekali kurang lebih 1 jam menunggu. Dari semua kesan yang ada, dapat dipastikan saya tidak akan pernah kembali lagi untuk menginap di Pullman Bandung."

Seharusnya Pullman mulai mempertimbangkan, karena tyt saya lihat banyak juga yang tidak puas dengan pelayanan di hotel yg punya namaini!! Pengalaman buruk saya juga saya alami dengan petugas FO, perempuan, sayang saya gainget namanya. Dia menelepon menanyakan menu untuk BF, cara ngomongnya nyolot dan tidak beretika sekali. Kaya ngomong sama orang yg ngemis makanan, gemes banget pengen maki rasanya. Jujur baru kali ini pegawai hotel tidak sopan sekali saat berbicara dengan tamunya. Saya ada beberapa kali telpon, dan selalu cewe itu yg angkat telpon kalau bicara bikin kesel. Jujur buat males banget kembali nginap di hotel ini. Staff resto ga ada masalah baik dan sopan. Malam ke 2, karena telpon ke 0 ga bisa terus, terpaksa pencet emergency, sekuriti yg angkat tapi sopan mungkin dsambungkan ke FO. Lalu ga lama FO telpon saya, saya sampaikan menu BF untuk besok pagi. Ternyata pagi2 menu yg saya pesan ga disampaikan ke pihak resto. Wah management nya perlu diperbaiki, atau gara2sudah kesel ama cewe FO pertama yg ngomongnya nyolot, saya jadi curiga ini ulah cewe itu lagi, jadi pikiran jelek ke hotel ini gara2ulah cewe FO yg bicaranya nyolot, tidak sopan, merendahkan!!!"

Dan saya dikasih screen shoot bukti sudah dibooking. Datang ke resepsionis, pake KTP saya ga bisa. Harus pake KTP pengguna CC. Trus CC jg harus dibawa ke lokasi, dipertanyakan jg sudah bayar apa belum bookingannya & dipertanyakan jg pengguna CC ikut menginap atau tidak di hotel ini 😂. Langsung lah saya nyeletuk ribet amat mau check in doang. (Dan dia pun ga ada inisiatif mengubungi kakak saya untuk konfirmasi apakah benar bookingan ini akan digunakan oleh bapak.....) Lanjut menelfon kakak untuk datang. Untungnya kakak menginapnya di braga, jd deket untuk nyusul ke sini. Menunggu lah saya 30 menit. Kakak kandung masih memarkirkan kendaraannya, lalu yg masuk duluan kakak ipar, kakak ipar langsung ke resepsionis dgn petugas yg berbeda. Setelah disambut menanyakan identitas KTP & CC. Lalu kakak ipar memberikan KTP nya, bukan KTP kakak kandung saya, & itu bisa diproses, langsung lah saya nyeletuk lah itu KTP lainnya bisa, knp td pake KTP saya ga bisa. Tanpa diundang, tiba2 muncul lah dari belakang petugas yg tadi diawal melayani saya & menolak saya, langsung menjelaskan ke kakak ipar saya Mohon maaf kami hanya ingin secure aja supaya bookingan bapak/ibu tidak digunakan oleh orang lain Langsung aja saya nyeletuk di belakang kakak ipar saya panik ga? Panik ga? Panik lah masa engga. Karna udah malas berdebat, saya menjauh lah dr meja resepsionis sambil ngebatin Ya udah yg penting bisa masuk kamar, udah capek nunggu ga ada kejelasan 2. Mau sarapan di sini harus reservasi, saya pilih gelombang yg jam 8.30. Datang lah saya & keluarga jam 8.50. Meja ternyata hampir semua terisi (seperti tidak terfilter masalah jam gelombang sarapan), hanya tersisa meja tinggi + bangku tinggi bergaya ala bar tempat minum2 gitu (saya bawa 2 anak kecil usia 3 tahun). Lalu saya cari keluar jg ga ada yg kosong, giliran ada yg kosong petugas mengarahkan ke arah meja tsb tetapi masih dlm keadaan kotor & masih blm tau itu ada orangnya atau engga yg menempati meja itu (tanpa ada inisiatif membersihkan dahulu). Akhirnya mencari sendiri di dalam, dan grup saya 6 orang duduk dengan meja terpisah. Lalu petugas datang untuk membersihkan sisa2 makanan di salah satu meja saya. Sambil saya komplain dikasih gelombang jam ga sih ya ini sarapan? Kok rame bgt susah cari meja?. Petugas menjawab bahwa ini sudah dikasih gelombang jam, ini kondisi yg agak mendingan agak sedikit orang. (Padahal saya yakin ini sistem jam gelombangnya tidak jalan, terlihat dr byk nya orang yg sarapan di jam yg bersamaan dgn saya reservasi). Petugas yg mengambilkan makanan pun, menarik piring yg saya serahkan jg agak kasar, tidak ramah, dgn nada yg tidak ramah. Rasa2nya saya kapok untuk menginap di sini lg"

Ini bukan kelalaian kecil; ini adalah kegagalan fatal dari standar keamanan hotel. Kegagalan Kritis yang Terungkap: - Tidak adanya mekanisme pemeriksaan ulang setelah layanan kebersihan - Tidak adanya verifikasi oleh supervisor atas keamanan kamar - Tidak adanya proses pemeriksaan keamanan yang seharusnya menjadi standar - Kegagalan manajemen dalam menerapkan protokol keamanan dasar Semua barang pribadi saya terekspos ke siapa pun yang mungkin lewat. Untungnya, tidak ada yang dicuri setelah saya memeriksa, tetapi bayangkan jika saya seorang pelancong wanita solo dan seseorang dengan niat jahat telah masuk dan menunggu di dalam? Tanggung jawab dan bahaya yang ditimbulkan sangat besar. Saya berharap Accor, sebagai pemimpin perhotelan global, dapat mempertahankan standar operasional dan keamanan yang sebanding dengan Marriott, Hilton, atau Kempinski. Insiden ini membuktikan sebaliknya. Jika petugas kebersihan bisa membiarkan pintu terbuka lebar tanpa proses verifikasi, langkah-langkah keamanan apa lagi yang diabaikan? Manajer Tugas Wirianto berusaha menangani situasi malam itu dengan menyediakan rekaman CCTV sejak saya meninggalkan kamar hingga kembali. Ia juga menawarkan hidangan buah dan kompensasi masa inap di masa mendatang. Saya menolak kedua kompensasi tersebut - ketika membayar tarif premium, saya mengharapkan keamanan premium, bukan permintaan maaf dan bonus setelah pelanggaran serius. Saya jadi tahu bahwa nama Manajer Umum adalah Dominique Albero dan ia seharusnya menyadari bahwa propertinya telah gagal dalam hal keramahtamahan yang paling mendasar - menjaga keselamatan tamu. Menurut saya, ini bukan tentang kesalahan satu petugas kebersihan. Ini tentang: - Kegagalan sistemik dalam prosedur operasional - Tidak adanya pemeriksaan keamanan berbasis tim - Manajemen tidak menerapkan pengawasan yang tepat - Mengutamakan efisiensi daripada keamanan Saya tidak akan menginap di properti Pullman mana pun di seluruh dunia setelah insiden ini. Ironisnya, saya tetap akan memilih Raffles (juga jaringan Accor) setelah merasakan layanan luar biasa di Raffles Makkah Palace pada Juli 2024 - membuktikan bahwa ini adalah masalah manajemen Pullman Bandung, bukan masalah Accor secara keseluruhan. Insiden ini membutuhkan intervensi perusahaan. Kelalaian satu properti dapat merusak reputasi merek Anda secara keseluruhan."

Jika Anda memesan kamar dengan balkon, Anda akan kesulitan tidur karena kebisingan jalan yang berlebihan, yang sangat mirip dengan tidur di jalanan. Hotel yang gagal memasang insulasi suara yang memadai atau setidaknya jendela kaca ganda tidak pantas disebut bintang 5."
"514.","Paisley","640","2024-01-21","1","Hotel ini terletak di pusat kota Bandung. Kamarnya bersih dan nyaman, tetapi proses check-innya sangat buruk sehingga hanya diberi satu bintang. Meskipun mereka sudah mengonfirmasi reservasi saya, mereka bilang tidak menemukan reservasi saya. Saya tidak percaya sampai saya menunjukkan voucher reservasi saya. Ketika akhirnya saya menemukannya, mereka berkata, Ya, mereka sudah mengonfirmasi sejak awal. Intinya, mereka menipu saya. Saya meminta kamar twin, tetapi ternyata kamar double. Mereka bilang kamar saya pemandangannya buruk karena sedang ramai. Mereka tertawa dan berkata, Jadi sarapan tidak termasuk, ya? Stafnya, sambil tersenyum, sangat kasar dan mengecewakan. Layanan kamar juga lambat. Pelayanannya buruk. Pengalaman pertama meninggalkan kesan buruk pada saya, dan saya memutuskan untuk tidak pernah kembali."
"515.","Romain Ulliana","2","2024-01-21","1","Saya menginap di hotel ini selama seminggu. Saya punya jam tangan berharga yang saya tinggalkan di kamar, yang dicuri oleh petugas kebersihan kamar. Saya sudah mengisi formulir dan meminta untuk melihat kamera, 3 mesin pembersih kamar, dan penyelidikan pun dilakukan. Ini pertama kalinya hal ini terjadi pada saya dan saya sangat marah. Saya ingin mengakses kamera agar mereka tahu bahwa saya masuk ke kamar dengan kamera itu dan memeriksa barang-barang saya jika mereka mau."

"518.","Ko Prastyo","7","2023-01-21","1","Selain hotel bintang 5 yang katanya, Pullman Bandung tidak memberikan pelayanan sebaik yang diharapkan. 1. Koordinasi antar tim kurang baik, saya menginap 3 hari 2 malam dengan metode pemesanan yang berbeda, tetapi resepsionis hanya memberikan informasi pemesanan satu malam dan menanyakan apakah saya harus check out atau memperpanjang, benar-benar kacau. 2. Saya ikut Gala Dinner Tahun Baru, dengan Oyster sebagai promosi utama di acara tersebut, coba tebak, hanya diisi ulang sekali, kami bertanya ke SPV, dan mereka sepertinya tidak peduli. 3. Mobil saya diparkir dengan jendela terbuka, petugas keamanan memberi tahu resepsionis tentang hal itu, tetapi tidak pernah sampai ke saya, wow, betapa hebatnya kolaborasi mereka. 4. Kamarnya tidak kedap suara, Anda bisa mendengar tetangga Anda berbicara, anak-anak berlarian di koridor. Kesimpulannya, Pullman belum siap untuk menjadi Hotel bintang 5."
"519.","Indira Virisya","11","2023-01-21","1","Tidak yakin apakah ini sepadan. Kami datang pukul 4 sore, lalu mereka bilang kamar belum siap. Kami harus menunggu di lounge selama beberapa jam. Ketika saya menindaklanjuti kamar pukul 5 sore, mereka meminta saya menunggu lagi dan hanya mengklik keyboard selama 15 menit lalu tidak mengatakan apa-apa. Jadi saya memutuskan untuk menulis ulasan ini sambil menunggu mereka 'memeriksa' kamar."
"520.","Cynthia Dhara","29","2023-01-21","1","Saya menginap selama 3 malam dan tidak bisa tidur. Bising dari jalan dan yang terburuk, ada juga suara dari lorong. Saya meminta layanan kamar untuk mengantarkan sarapan ke kamar saya. Tidak masalah, tetapi pada malam kedua layanan kamar menelepon saya pukul 3 pagi!!! bertanya apakah saya ingin sarapan di kamar saya. Pullman Bandung adalah hotel bintang 5 dengan kualitas terendah, baik dari segi layanan maupun bangunan."

Bookingan saya di tiket.com di cancel sepihak oleh pihak hotel pada H- 1 dengan alasan tidak ada jaminan pembayaran. Voucher hotel saya itu pay at hotel, sudah pesan dari bulan mei 2025, kalau butuh deposit ya tinggal hubungi saja ada waktu 6 bulan. Bukan ngehubungin H-1 di JAM 17.15 WIB, LEWAT EMAIL, DAN CUT OFF KONFIRMASI JAM 18.00 WIB jika lewat dari pkl 18 dibatalkan. Ini lewat EMAIL ya sekali lg saya tekankan (memang mau cari kamar cancelan aja). Dan saya telp konfirmasi langsung jam 19.30 begitu tau emailnya, kamar sudah fully booked dan tdk ada solusi dr pihak hotel. Saya memilih hotel pullman krn ada seminar di sana, dan saya msh ada bayi menyusui dmn saya perlu bolak balik ke kamar di waktu waktu tertentu, jd tdk mgkn bs dilakukan jika saya tdk stay di pullman. Oiya solusi pihak hotel saya stay di kamar suite krn itu kamar yg msh available, dengan harga normal. Tentu saja hal ini sangat memberatkan disamping harga yg jauh lebih mahal juga saya dtg hanya utk seminar bukan utk berlibur. Kesalahan dr pihak manajemen tp saya yg hrs d rugikan dgn mengeluarkan budget jauh lbh mahal, jd itu bukan solusi dan pertanggungjawaban yg fair menurut saya. Fast forward, saya cari solusi sendiri dengan mencari cancelan kamar dr teman sejawat kami di hotel ibis lalu pindah ke pullman itupun dr pihak hotel tdk memberikan kemudahan bagi saya utk early check in. Saya harus complain berkali kali spy hotel mengusahakan saya spy bisa early check in menyesuaikan wkt cekout hotel ibis. Kmdn pada saat saya cek in di pullman tdk ada satupun staff yg menemui saya utk membahas masalah ini, ataupun meminta maaf atas ketidaknyamanan yg tlh saya alami. Mungkin krn saya rakyat jelata ya bukan pejabat jadi kalian tidak meresponse complainan saya. Sungguh tidak profesional, dan utk pelayanan sangat kurang utk level hotel bintang 5. Saya tdk merekomendasikan pullman hotel bandung ke sejawat ataupun keluarga saya Oiya disaat ramai orang antri di lift karena ada seminar disitu, petugas hotel hold satu pintu lift krn akan ada pejabat datang shg menyebabkan penumpukan tamu di depan lift. Luar biasa pelayanannya bener bener bintang limaaa (khusus pejabat :) )"

Ini aneh bgt bantal yg kecil mana keras, mau ala ala bantal tempur kali ya tapi ini yang versi jueelek jadi bikin leher sakit aja. Yang satu bantalnya gede banget mana bntuknya kotak, kayak bantal sofa bukan bantal utk tempat tidur. Bikin tidur ga nyenyak n nyaman. Terus TV ga jalan, loading terus tulisannya need to free some space lah, aduuhh ini TV tulisan remote nya smart TV tapi realitanya lemot banget gabisa ngapa2in, masa hotel bintang 5 TV nya kayak gini, ampun kalah sama hotel esek esek. Mana internet WIFI pun lemot banget, dipake nelfon WA putus putus. Trus ribet juga klo pesen gofood ambil harus di G, mana jauh perbatasan sama IBIS, kenapa ga dibikin gampang aja sih, hotel dimana mana juga ambil makanan di concierge.

Kalau di Akasa sampai kita kelar baru di ambil piring kotornya. Buah nanasnya asem dan paling parahnya pepayanya pahit. Masa ga di test food dlu ya sebelum disajikan… ckckck Nasi goreng terinya juga keras dan dingin. Tapi mie ayamnya beneran enak… Utk kids club bagus, luas dan banyak pilihan. Anak2 suka kids paintingnya. Bagus dan mba di bagian ini ramah. Untuk kolam berenangnya kecil banget. Hahaha. Seperti main-mainan. Jadi sayang banget. Staffnya bagian resepsionis aja yg ramah, selebihnya biasa aja. Staff yg pas check out jutek banget. Mba-mba lupa namanya. Tongsis aku ketinggalan tapi lama banget. Butuh waktu lebih dari 30 menit utk minta tolong check dan itu juga ga ada respon. Padahal sebelum turun, kami ketemu supervisor floor. Masa ita beliau sibuk beud kan… ckckck.

Sampai hotel 1.45 , tidak taunya masih belom siap dan minta kita tunggu lagi lebih dari 45 menit dan masih belom pasti..Bilangnya kasih complimentary drinks, sekeluarga ada 7 orang, dan tidak taunya complimentarynya cuma 2 minuman saja dan suruh bayar sisanya kita cuma order jus dan aqua dan tidak ada alcohol dll yang minuman mahal... Service seperti apaaa ini...udah mereka ngk bagus servicenya , suruh kita tunggu, complimentary drinks dibatasin cuma 2 drinks aja..itu namanya basa-basi ngusir suruh ke bar untuk kita tidak kecewa di bagian resepsionis supaya kita ngk marah di depan orang2. Dan pas kita tunggu, sampai jam 3.45 dapet info kamar udah siap...suruh ke reseption, pas kita sampai, dibilang kamar masih belom siap dan baru 1 kamar aj. Pas kita tidak terima marah2 baru di check dan bilang nanti kita minta late check out sampai jam 4 juga merka ngk kasih dan desepsionis check di computer di infoin tidak taunya ada kamar lagi yang 2 kamar bisa connecting dan udah siap....gimana sih, tadi katanya baru satu kamar, dan abis di marahin ngk taunya ada 2 kamar yang kita minta. tolong service kalian di naikan dan di benerin... Kita bayar ngk murah untuk 5 hari dua kamar dan kalian mustinya service bintang 5, tidak seperti bintang 3 yang masih ngasal2 Dan para ibu2 bawa jewelry, ati2 sekali... ibu saya kehilanga anting emasnya. Memang ibu saya udah tua dan kadang teledor, dia taro di box jewellry dia dan di taro di wastafle , tapi ngk di masukin di safety box karena dia pikir positive dan Karena dia kira aman. Lucunya hilang yang anting emas aja, yang anting peraknya semua aman di tinggalkan. Kita double and tripple check jatoh kali but tidak taunya memang hilang. Dia belom pakai sama sekali dan sebelom keluar kamar dia inget masih di dalem box karena dia mau pake but ngk jadi ngk cocok sama bajunya. Dan pas seharian pergi, balik... sudah ngk ada. Lucunya pas kita mau cabut kita ketemu cleaning team kamar dan minta di bersihkan kamarnya. keliatannya di ambil sama team cleaning room. (Maaf kalo suzon). kita laporkan ke team resepsionis dan mereka coba investigasi dan bantu. Tapi tidak kembali dan ibu saya iklaskan saja .... jadi buat ibu2 yang mau nginep bener2 hati2 yeah bilamana nginep di hotel ini dan bawa jewellry kalian. Inget taro di safety box.

Mengingat hotel ini telah beroperasi selama beberapa tahun, manajemen seharusnya sudah memiliki proyeksi jumlah tamu yang akan datang dan merencanakan ke depan, seperti: - Membuka restoran atau ruang serbaguna lain untuk sarapan (yang hanya mereka lakukan selama akhir pekan) - Mengalokasikan slot waktu bagi para tamu untuk membagi keramaian Bagaimana jika tamu yang sudah berada di dalam memilih untuk tetap tinggal sampai akhir waktu sarapan? Hotel juga tidak dapat memaksa mereka untuk keluar, bukan? Maka tidak akan ada meja yang tersedia dan tidak ada jaminan waktu tunggu untuk tamu lain.

Saya akan mulai dengan hal-hal positifnya: 1. Ya, hotelnya mewah, kamarnya modern, bagus, bersih, dan luas dengan fasilitas yang lengkap. 2. Hal terbaik yang dimiliki Pullman adalah stafnya, mereka sangat profesional, ramah, dan membantu (terima kasih kepada Bapak Renaldi). Namun, kekurangannya adalah: 1. Pengalaman tidurnya seperti mimpi buruk (saya menginap di kamar lantai 6), kebisingan jalan tidak tertahankan, karena hotel ini terletak di area pusat kota yang ramai. Masalahnya, kamarnya tidak dilengkapi sistem kedap suara/jendela berinsulasi. Rasanya seperti tidur di trotoar. Saya dan ibu saya (76 tahun) juga tidak bisa tidur, yang menjadi alasan saya memesan hotel ini hanya untuk memastikan beliau tidak terlalu lelah sebelum kembali ke Jakarta. Saya minta pindah ke kamar lain dan bersedia membayar biaya tambahan jika perlu, sayangnya menurut ibu Febi hotel sudah penuh dipesan dan hanya tersisa 1 kamar (ukuran king) yang bukan jenis tempat tidur yang saya butuhkan dan dia menawarkan saya airplug, tetapi saya menolak karena itu tidak membantu sama sekali. Pukul 12.30 saya menelepon resepsionis (dengan ponsel saya - telepon kamar tidak berfungsi) dan memutuskan untuk check out karena tidak ada gunanya tetap tinggal di hotel tetapi kami tidak bisa tidur. Tuan Renaldi menanggapi panggilan saya, dia berusaha keras untuk menyelesaikan situasi dengan mendatangkan teknisi untuk mengurangi kebisingan dan menawarkan saya kamar lain di lantai 10, menyiapkan tempat tidur king size menjadi twin, pada pukul 1 pagi ibu saya dan saya pindah ke kamar itu. Saya juga berpikir saya menginap di waktu yang salah, hotel sudah penuh dipesan dan ada 2 acara pernikahan. Hotel belum siap dan mengantisipasi untuk mengelola tamu yang banyak, pengaturan sarapan kacau, daftar tunggu panjang meskipun staf restoran berusaha keras untuk mengelola. Untuk hotel bintang 5, Pullman Bandung perlu meningkatkan dan mengantisipasi hal ini seperti mengatur waktu sarapan yang berbeda atau membuka area (restoran lain jika tersedia) untuk menyajikan sarapan. Saya mengalami hal ini di hotel lain karena banyaknya tamu atau selama pandemi karena pembatasan sosial, yang berjalan sangat lancar dan nyaman bagi tamu. Jadi secara umum, pengalaman menginap saya di Pullman adalah pengalaman terburuk yang belum pernah saya alami di hotel bintang 5 lainnya, bahkan dibandingkan dengan hotel bintang 4. Saya juga baru menyadari bahwa keluhan kebisingan yang mengerikan telah disampaikan oleh tamu lain sebelumnya (saya lihat di ulasan), tetapi saya pikir manajemen hotel tidak menanggapinya dengan serius. Jadi dengan sangat menyesal, saya harus memberi nilai rendah untuk ulasan ini. Bapak Renaldi dan Ibu Febi terima kasih atas bantuan dan kebaikan kalian, karena untuk kalian berdua saya tidak memberi nilai 1 untuk Pullman 😀"

Kamar-kamarnya tidak cocok untuk pelancong yang menginap 5 hingga 6 malam karena Anda tinggal di luar koper. Tidak mungkin menyimpan pakaian di kamar! Kamarnya penuh dengan dekorasi yang tidak berguna dan tidak mengurangi fungsionalitasnya. Lounge, yang bisa saya akses, sangat buruk untuk menikmati koktail malam. Anda akan dilayani ketika ada tamu, dan itu seperti mencari jarum di tumpukan jerami. Jadi, secara keseluruhan, ini tidak cukup. Makanannya fantastis. Stafnya ramah. Tapi tetap saja tidak menutupi semua hal negatifnya."

Ini bisa mencakup sikap acuh tak acuh, kurangnya senyum, atau kurangnya kesediaan untuk membantu tamu. 2.

Bahkan lebih lezat masakn pembantu kami di rumah. Mohon di improve dan jangan terlalu pelit untuk budget yng dikeluarkan. Juga pada tanggal 29 Juni jam 10:30 mulai terasa jika AC Sentral di lorong² menuju kamar, mulai dimatikan. Benar² pengalaman menginap yng abal² untuk standar kami.

Saat tanya untuk menu anak diarahkan ambil telur dan sosis. Hari kedua gulai kambing. Saat tanya sama chef dibilang hanya itu, bisa pesen telur. Lalu chef bilang “sebentar saya tanyakan ke belakang” saya ngga tau tanya apa yang jelas he didn’t come back to me. Lokasi breakfast juga sangat terbatas. Bisa breakfast di lantai 17 tapi menu buffet ada di area smoking. Seriously? Kids club cukup besar dan bersih. Tp saat anak saya kesana tidak ada mainan yg bisa dimainkan. Hanya ada tv menyala dan mewarnai. Karpet di kamar juga butuh maintenance. Sudah gampang brudul bgt sehingga menyebabkan debu-debu. Harga hanya untuk lokasi saja. Fasilitas dan layanan masih jauh jika di compare dengan hotel harga setara tp lokasi tidak di tengah kota."

SOP kalian harus diperbaiki karena H-1 saya tiba dapat pesan dari whatsapp dan harus mengsettle payment dalam kurun waktu yg sangat singkat dgn cara mengklik link yang kalian berikan dari whatsapp. Ini hari kerja dan kebetulan hari tersebut saya ada agenda meeting sangat penting. Saat saya terpaksa harus keluar dari meeting untuk menyampaikan kekecewaan saya di sore jam 6an, kalian tidak bisa membantu sama sekali dan harus membooking ulang dengan harga yg bedanya hampir 50% dari harga awal. Ini nih level hospitality yang ditawarkan hotel bintang 5 sekelas Pullman di Bandung? 1. Adjust SOP kalian yang memberi waktu sangat singkat untuk “memaksa” tamu kalian melakukan action. Tamu kalian punya kesibukan sendiri. Remind this H-2! 2. Sekarang ini marak penipuan dari whatsapp. Tiba-tiba menerima link dari nomor tidak dikenal untuk melakukan transaksi itu mengerikan dan mmebuat skeptis. Kalian sekelas hotel bintang 5 setidaknya modal sedikit buat whatsapp kalian ada centangnya/verified. Susahkah berpikir dari kacamata tamu? Apalagi bisnis kalian di bidang jasa dan bintang lima. Cmon! Update setelah nginap: Terlepas dari kekecewaan saya ttg kejadian yg saya jelaskan di atas, sebenarnya utk kamarnya, staffnya (terutama yg breakfast), design hotelnya secara overall, lift yang standby dan cepat semuanya, dan gym yang above average, semuanya sangat bagus. Saya gabisa kasih full 5 stars tapi saya rasa revisi yg saya kasih sudah cukup fair."
"618.","Fenny Octa","60","2025-01-21","3","Pertama kalinya menginap di Pullman & mengalami kejadian ga enak kepada saya saat saya menginap bulan lalu. Pada saat check out, Ada barang yang tertinggal di kamar tapi tidak diinfokan sampai saya baru sadar ada 1 barang yang tertinggal dikamar saat sudah sampai dirumah, dan permintaan ganti rugi oleh pihak hotel atas gelas yang pecah yang kami sendiri (terutama anak-anak) tidak merasa memecahkan. Kami tidak mempermasalahkan gelas pecah maupun masalah ganti rugi. Namun yang menjadi point saya adalah, kenapa pada saat pihak hotel menghubungi kami untuk meminta ganti rugi, tidak memberitahukan bahwa ada barang tertinggal dikamar? Saya tetap mengucapkan terima kasih karena pihak Hotel sudah mengembalikan barang saya. Terima kasih banyak Pak Bodhi. Overall, Experience saya saat menginap di Pullman cukup menyenangkan meskipun ada misscom yang perlu diperbaiki oleh mgt agar bisa memberikan service yang lebih baik lagi bagi customer kedepannya.

Sarung bantalnya ga tau kapan terakhir diganti karena ada noda lipstik, untung saya bawa sarung bantal sendiri. Pilihan sarapan juga standard aja, dimsumnya kering dan kulitnya ketebelan, sate kambing kurang matang, mesen capucino mesti 3x diingetin, mie ayamnya jg standar. Yang ngeselin adalah urusan minta parkir gratis harus diregister pake emoney yg mana repot bgt kalo emoney ditinggal di mobil, ga praktis, pdhl hotel berbintang 5 lain cuma cukup ngasi nomer plat mobil aja. Tapi yg paling juara bikin kesel adalah...kolam renangnya keccciiiilll bangettttt, udah gitu GABUNG sama tamu hotel IBIS di sebelahnya!!. Pantesan jaman pandemi gini hrs daftar dulu kalo mw renang.

"666.","Resty Kusumawati","6","2025-10-21","3","Sayangnya, saya tidak bisa merekomendasikan Pullman Bandung kepada rekan-rekan saya untuk acara mendatang. Baru-baru ini saya mengorganisir 75 peserta untuk paket pertemuan sehari penuh dan 28 peserta untuk pertemuan setengah hari keesokan harinya, juga 26 kamar untuk 3 hari 2 malam. Dibandingkan dengan hotel lain, di mana ruang pertemuan kecil biasanya disediakan gratis untuk diskusi pribadi atau panggilan telepon panitia penyelenggara, kami malah diminta membayar biaya tambahan di sini, yang membuat kami enggan menggunakan fasilitas tersebut. Kami juga mempertimbangkan untuk mengadakan makan malam di atap gedung, tetapi diberitahu oleh tim Penjualan bahwa hal itu tidak memungkinkan. Mereka hanya merekomendasikan restoran steak mereka, Mad Cow. Akibatnya, kami mengadakan makan malam di tempat lain, yang merupakan peluang pendapatan yang terlewatkan bagi hotel. Secara keseluruhan, saya menemukan beberapa aspek layanan di bawah ekspektasi. Tim Penjualan Jakarta tidak pernah mengunjungi kantor kami untuk membahas detail acara, sehingga saya harus menindaklanjutinya berulang kali. Ketika saya melakukan inspeksi lokasi di Bandung, perwakilan Penjualan tidak terlalu ramah dan tidak berinisiatif untuk memamerkan ruang pertemuan. Saya harus meminta secara khusus untuk melihat kamar-kamarnya, dan ruang awal yang dialokasikan berada di sudut tertutup. Lebih lanjut, selama inspeksi lokasi, tidak ada minuman ringan yang ditawarkan. Air putih baru disajikan setelah kami memberi isyarat, sedangkan di hotel lain, saya rasa sudah menjadi praktik standar untuk memberikan keramahan yang lebih, seperti menawarkan kopi? Atau makan siang? Saya harap umpan balik ini dapat membantu meningkatkan kualitas layanan untuk klien di masa mendatang."
"667.","Ahmad Nadeem","27","2026-01-07","3","Menginap di sini pada malam tahun baru. Tata letak kamar sama buruknya dengan Pullman Jakarta. Anehnya, kamar deluxe mereka tidak memiliki lemari sama sekali. Sungguh nyaman. Tidak ada shower Muslim di toilet, malah ada pancuran semprot yang konyol itu. Kolam renangnya kecil. Staf restoran kurang membantu dan Anda harus mengurus sendiri. Ditambah lagi menunya juga biasa saja. Area kebugaran, area bermain remaja, dan jalur jogging di luar ruangan adalah nilai tambah."
"668.","Ashiva Aulia","6","2025-10-21","3","Lokasi dan kamar hotel bagus — pelayanannya buruk, terutama saat check-in. Sangat tidak menyenangkan, dan tahukah Anda? Pengalaman ini akan menjadi patokan bagi saya untuk memutuskan apakah saya akan menginap di sini lagi atau tidak di masa mendatang. 1. Harus menunggu hampir SATU JAM agar kamar siap (berdasarkan pengalaman saya sebelumnya, saya harus menelepon hotel terlebih dahulu untuk meminta check-in lebih awal, tetapi masih bisa check-in sekitar pukul 14.00. Kali ini saya check-in pukul 14.00 hanya untuk mendapatkan kamar yang siap 45+ menit kemudian). Benar-benar mengecewakan. 2. Antrean check-in SANGAT MENGERIKAN (pada suatu saat, beberapa wanita acak bisa memotong antrian Anda). Ini adalah hotel papan atas, tetapi pengalaman pelanggannya mengecewakan dan tidak ideal. 3. Latih staf garis depan Anda, yang berada di lobi, untuk lebih ramah dan meningkatkan keramahan. Jika Anda membutuhkan lebih banyak staf untuk menangani lalu lintas tamu yang padat, tambahkan staf selama periode tersebut. Selama menunggu kamar, sulit untuk bertanya kepada staf. Tidak ada yang siaga melayani tamu yang menunggu, atau setidaknya ada di sana untuk ditanya. Belum lagi karena poin 2 di atas, saya hanya perlu informasi tentang persiapan kamar, tetapi tidak ada yang siap ditanya, dan seorang wanita tua tiba-tiba memotong pembicaraan. Lobi adalah titik kontak pertama Anda dengan tamu di hotel, dan penting untuk memberikan pengalaman yang baik. Ingat juga: Anda menawarkan keramahtamahan saat menjalankan bisnis ini. Jadikan itu prioritas. Anggap proses check-in sebagai bagian dari proses onboarding. Saya bisa bilang, langkah awal check-in/onboarding ini benar-benar tidak menyenangkan dan tidak dapat diterima untuk hotel yang katanya bintang 5. Mohon evaluasi dan perbaiki hal ini."
"669.","Y. Rust.","75","2025-07-21","3","Maaf PULLMAN, kali ini Anda mengecewakan saya. Saya berada di tingkatan ACCOR dan seharusnya berhak atas check-in lebih awal DAN check-out lebih lambat. Sehari sebelum kedatangan saya, pihak lounge menghubungi saya dan saya menyebutkan bahwa saya akan tiba sekitar pukul 12.00 siang, dan mereka menjawab bahwa mereka akan mencoba untuk menyiapkan kamar saya, tetapi tidak dapat menjaminnya. Oke. Pada hari itu, saya tiba pukul 13.15 dan melakukan check-in, tetapi kamar saya belum siap. Saya mengingatkan mereka bahwa saya perlu keluar lagi dalam 15 menit karena ada rapat pelanggan. Jadi mereka mencoba, setelah 20 menit saya mendapatkan kamar saya dengan alasan mereka memindahkan fasilitas selamat datang (kue, dll.) dari kamar lain ke kamar yang sekarang saya tempati. Karena saya terlalu sibuk dan lelah untuk mengeluh, fasilitas selamat datang berupa kue dan kartu tersebut tidak pernah sampai ke kamar saya sampai saat saya melakukan check-out. Seprai juga terkena noda abu-abu, tapi saya baru menyadarinya hampir tengah malam saat hendak tidur, terlalu lelah untuk mengeluh. Saat meminta air mineral, mereka bilang batasnya 4 botol air tambahan per hari dan saya sudah melebihinya; jadi saya akan pergi ke gym dan mengisi ulang di sana. Saya menyampaikan semua pengalaman ini kepada wanita di executive lounge dan berharap Anda dapat memperbaikinya. Dulu tidak seperti ini, saya mengunjungi tempat ini hampir setiap 4-6 bulan dalam 3 tahun terakhir. Tapi kali ini adalah yang terburuk. Oh PULLMAN, ini benar-benar bukan layanan bintang lima. Tolong perbaiki diri Anda dan jadilah lebih baik. Saya berharap itu terjadi saat saya kembali ke sana."
"670.","misotam","284","2025-07-21","3","Mungkin satu-satunya tempat di Bandung yang cukup besar untuk acara apa pun. Terletak di pusat kota dan tepat di sebelah bekas gedung gubernur. Kamar dan fasilitasnya sangat kuno tetapi terawat dengan baik. Kamarnya besar, tetapi tata letaknya aneh. Karena merupakan gedung tertinggi di sekitarnya, pemandangannya tidak terhalang. Namun, karena berada tepat di sebelah jalan utama dan jendela kedap suara tidak ada, tempat ini bisa menjadi sangat bising di malam hari. Tidak banyak fasilitas yang bisa dibicarakan. Hanya ada dua treadmill di pusat kebugaran, dan kolam renang kecil."
"671.","Pascalia","8","2025-01-21","3","Saya menginap di Pullman Bandung akhir pekan lalu selama 1 malam. Terima kasih kepada tim GR dan tim HK untuk dekorasi yang ramah. Saya sudah punya ekspektasi tinggi dengan hotel ini, terutama karena hotelnya baru dan pengalaman yang luar biasa dengan Pullman lainnya. Lobi hotelnya indah dan mewah, tempat parkirnya juga luas dan terang, sarapannya enak, sambutan stafnya juga sangat baik, kamar dan fasilitasnya juga bagus. Namun beberapa hal yang mengecewakan saya adalah kebersihan sprei (saya menemukan beberapa noda di sprei, juga bau selimut, bantal, dan sprei tidak sedap), meja samping tempat tidur juga tidak bersih (sebenarnya saya harus mengelapnya lagi, karena menemukan beberapa noda lengket), housekeepingnya juga lambat ketika saya meminta keset kamar mandi dan sandal tambahan (saya menelepon 2 kali untuk permintaan ini). Saya tahu hotelnya penuh, tetapi seharusnya mereka lebih dari mampu untuk menyediakannya, bukan? Saya pikir ini bukan masalah yang wajar untuk hotel bintang 5 dan juga hotel baru. Semua itu saya temukan di malam hari sebelum tidur, jadi saya tidak menelepon housekeeping untuk mengganti sprei, karena kami sudah sangat lelah menunggu lagi. Jadi saya baru melaporkannya ke FO keesokan harinya saat kami check out. Pengalamannya kali ini kurang memuaskan. Mohon perbaiki Pullman Bandung ini."
"672.","Michael Chang","4","2025-01-21","3","Sebagai anggota Platinum, saya memesan 5 kamar termasuk sarapan, tetapi hanya mendapatkan sarapan untuk 2 kamar. Akhirnya saya harus membayar tambahan untuk sarapan. Minuman selamat datang tidak ditawarkan saat check-in. Kue selamat datang di setiap kamar berbeda-beda, ada yang diberi kue & buah, sementara yang lain hanya kue. (Lihat gambar) Juga, tirai di kamar tidak bisa ditutup sepenuhnya, sehingga beberapa lampu masih masuk saat saya tidur. (Lihat gambar) Semoga ada lebih banyak perbaikan di kunjungan saya berikutnya!"
"673.","Jimmy Lim","6","2025-01-21","3","Lokasinya bagus, tetapi desain kamarnya bisa lebih baik lagi, TV terlihat tua dan penunjuk kendali jarak jauh tidak berfungsi, suhu kamar sangat dingin meskipun AC mati, tidak banyak fasilitas untuk anak-anak bermain, sarapan prasmanannya juga biasa saja."
"674.","simple cse","4","2024-01-21","3","Saya di kamar 1518 (Junior Suite) dan tidak bisa tidur jam 1 pagi karena suara bising dari jalan. Kedap suara perlu ditingkatkan untuk kamar dengan pemandangan kota. Tips sederhana, mintalah kamar lain jika Anda mendapatkan pemandangan kota dan Anda mudah terbangun. Sarapannya kurang memuaskan, biasa saja. Menginap selama 2 malam di sini dan saya selalu gelisah di malam hari."
"675.","Herfini Haryono","5","2024-01-21","3","Kamarnya tidak sebersih hotel bintang 5. Mereka seharusnya belajar dari Hotel Pullman Jakarta tentang cara membersihkan kamar, terutama kamar mandi, dengan benar. Ada beberapa noda di wastafel, pintu kaca shower rusak, dan karpet kamar juga bernoda. Interior kamarnya bagus."
"676.","otto arya","15","2023-01-21","3","Jadi kami menginap di sini sekitar akhir September.. Kamarnya luar biasa, layanan kamarnya juga luar biasa; mungkin salah satu layanan kamar terbaik, nasi goreng, fasilitasnya lumayan, kolam renangnya agak terlalu kecil. TAPI.. ada TAPI besar ini.. Jadi kami menginap di lantai 15. Pada hari pertama kami pergi ke lantai dasar untuk sarapan dan pelayan memberi tahu kami bahwa kamar eksekutif memiliki restoran sarapan eksklusif di lantai 17, jadi kami pergi ke lantai 17. Tidak banyak yang tersedia di prasmanan (meskipun pilihan rotinya banyak) karena entah bagaimana menu utama seperti sarapan ala Amerika, dimsum, dll. dibuat sesuai pesanan. Jadi kami memesan sarapan ala Amerika. Istri saya sedang berada di kios bakso dan pelayan memberi tahu bahwa mereka sedang memanaskan kembali bakso dan akan mengirimkan bakso ke meja kami dengan pesanan a la carte (sarapan ala Amerika) miliknya. Barang ini tidak datang hingga 30 menit berikutnya, mungkin lebih. Kami bertanya kepada staf pelayan tetapi entah bagaimana makanannya masih belum siap, baik bakso maupun sarapan ala Amerika. Kami memiliki jadwal yang harus dikejar, jadi saya meminta pelayan untuk membatalkan pesanan kami, pelayan berkata baiklah maaf dan akan memberi tahu dapur. Ketika kami hendak pergi, makanan datang, baik sarapan ala Amerika maupun bakso. Baksonya tidak panas, hanya hangat kuku. Sedikit kecewa pada hari pertama kami, tetapi tidak ada yang serius. Hari kedua pun tiba, sarapan kedua dan mungkin yang terakhir di sini. Kembali ke lantai 17, awalnya kami ingin mencoba restoran di lobi tetapi lagi-lagi penuh. Jadi kami naik ke lantai 17 dengan harapan yang terbaik, memberi tahu nomor kamar saya kepada staf pelayan dan kemudian dia mengatakan nomor kamar saya sudah diambil dan seseorang ada di dalam dengan nomor itu. Wah, Bu, itu mustahil. Kunci kamar saya ada di sini, dan istri saya satu-satunya beserta anak-anak saya ada di sini. Awalnya dia tidak percaya (dia bilang terus siapa yang masuk ya) dan menyuruh saya menunggu sementara dia memeriksa masalahnya. Saya menyuruhnya membawa tamu dengan nomor kamar saya ke resepsionis. Masalahnya terpecahkan tanpa drama (belum), jadi kami masuk, duduk di sofa di area minuman, dan pasangan di seberang meja memasang wajah marah yang membuat saya merasa tidak enak. Meja kami belum dibersihkan, jadi kami menunggu sebentar. Saya dan istri melewatkan menu a la carte, dan langsung menuju pilihan roti yang hampir kosong. Kami mengambil roti dan kembali ke meja saya yang belum dibersihkan. Saya harus memanggil pelayan lagi untuk membersihkan meja kami. Saat itulah saya menyadari pasangan di seberang meja kami marah karena meja mereka belum dibersihkan setelah menunggu lama. Peralatan makan juga belum siap di meja bahkan setelah saya meminta kepada pelayan, dan saya tidak tahu mengapa karena saya melihat beberapa peralatan makan tergeletak begitu saja di kasir tanpa dibungkus dan tidak ada orang di sana, jadi saya mengambilnya saja. Entah bagaimana, prosesnya lebih cepat daripada yang diminta. Seorang pelayan melihat saya mengambil beberapa dan meminta maaf lalu membantu saya membawa lebih banyak peralatan makan ke meja. Pilihan minumannya lumayan (jus), tetapi tidak ada gelas. Kami menunggu sekitar 10-15 menit untuk segelas minuman, dan sudah meminta kepada pelayan tetapi tidak berhasil. Ketika mereka datang, jumlahnya tidak banyak, jadi ada tamu yang menunggu lagi untuk gelasnya, yang memakan waktu sangat lama. Pilihan sarapan lainnya tidak banyak, stafnya penuh dan melayani menu a la carte, dan saya hanya melihat sekitar 1 koki mengisi ulang roti dan menu prasmanan. Saya rasa mereka kekurangan tenaga kerja. Saya melihat sekeliling dan hanya ada 1 pelayan yang membersihkan meja, 1 lagi mencuci piring, dan 1 lagi mengisi ulang prasmanan. Sisanya sibuk dan saling berteriak di meja a la carte. Ini tidak bisa diterima untuk standar Pullman, demi Tuhan, ini Pullman, dan saya mendapatkan pengalaman sarapan yang lebih baik di hotel lain, maaf. Mungkin Anda kekurangan tenaga kerja atau mungkin memesan a la carte di tengah sarapan prasmanan bukanlah ide yang bagus, saya tidak tahu, tetapi mereka benar-benar perlu memperbaikinya. Catatan: Pasangan yang marah di seberang meja kami pergi setelah sekitar 10 menit. Mereka mengambil roti tetapi tidak pernah memakannya. Tidak tahu mengapa, mungkin tidak ada peralatan makan yang tersedia di kasir. Jika Anda ingin menginap di sini, pesan saja kamar Anda tanpa sarapan."
"677.","Nicolas","76","2024-01-21","3","Banyak lalu lintas di sekitar hotel, dan banyak kemacetan lalu lintas, jadi itu kekurangannya. Saya menikmati hidangan mewah di hotel, sejujurnya makanannya di bawah standar untuk hotel sekelas ini. Makanan disajikan dingin. Namun, pelayanannya sangat baik dan stafnya ramah."
"678.","Irsan S.","348","2023-01-21","3","Mungkin ekspektasi saya terlalu tinggi, tetapi kualitas dan nilai pengalaman secara keseluruhan di hotel ini jauh lebih rendah dibandingkan dengan hotel Gaia/Hilton/Padma. Catatan: Saya membandingkan hotel-hotel ini berdasarkan perbandingan harga."
"679.","Anizza Restra Pusparianti","46","2023-01-21","3","Bukan pengalaman terbaik yang pernah saya alami. Saya rasa hotel ini paling cocok untuk bisnis, bukan liburan atau keluarga. Kelebihan: • Pelayanan sangat baik, semua staf ramah, Mas Rifki, Mas Sultan, Mbak Indri • Terletak di jantung Kota Bandung. • Terdapat food court di bawah yang menyajikan makanan khas Bandung • Tata letak kamar didesain dengan indah dan ruang yang kompak Kekurangan: • Suara bising dari jalan; Untuk manajemen Pullman Bandung, kalian gila dan tidak manusiawi, dan kalian seharusnya malu karena tidak mampu menyediakan sistem/jendela kedap suara dan membiarkan tamu tidur dan mengalami waktu tidur yang buruk. Jadi, para tamu harap meminta kamar di lantai yang lebih tinggi agar setidaknya kebisingan minimal. Saya menginap di lantai 3. • Kolam renang kecil dan dingin. Saya tidak terlalu mempermasalahkan hal kecil ini. Namun, dibandingkan hotel lain, Pullman memilih untuk tetap berada di abad ke-19 di mana pemanas air belum ditemukan. 😔 • Nomor panggilan cepat di telepon kamar tidak berguna. Sayangnya, nomor panggilan cepat di telepon kamar (kamar 320) tidak ada gunanya. Ada 3 nomor panggilan cepat; layanan satu atap, makan di kamar(?), darurat. Setiap kali Anda menekan nomor, akan terhubung ke saluran yang sibuk. Dan kita harus menebak 0 untuk berbicara dengan operator. (tidak ada petunjuk sama sekali) Mungkin jelas untuk menekan 0 kecuali jika sudah pukul 11.30 malam, setengah sadar, setengah linglung, setengah gila, ingin meminta penyumbat telinga karena kebisingan yang terlalu keras di jalan. Jadi, manajemen Pullman Bandung, tolong, Anda perlu berbenah... Saya bahkan tidak ingin membandingkan Anda dengan manajemen Pullman Puncak..."
"680.","yogi Halim","200","2022-01-21","3","Kamar bagus, lokasi strategis, dekat tempat makan populer seperti Justus Steak. Liftnya buruk, tidak ada lampu indikator di keran kartu kunci, sehingga sulit untuk mengetuk dan menekan nomor lantai, masih tidak ada tombol sentuh, pintu tertutup terlalu cepat (mungkin tidak masalah jika mengetuk kartu kunci secara otomatis memilih lantai kamar, dan area umum lainnya dapat diakses tanpa kartu kunci. Ini pasti akan mempercepat antrean lift). Sarapannya biasa saja. Bahkan Green Forest Lembang menyajikan makanan berkualitas lebih baik meskipun tidak semewah itu. Satenya enak tetapi seringkali pahit, panggangannya jarang dikorek. Buburnya buruk karena tidak dirawat. Mienya kualitasnya seperti gerobak kaki lima Jakarta, kurang matang dan bertepung. Dimsum jelas menggunakan merek umum, tidak segar dan menyebabkan gatal di lidah. Bagaimana Anda bisa menjadi koki hotel bintang 5 tanpa tahu sosis sapi sebagian besar terbuat dari tepung (sosis ayam lebih baik), setidaknya gunakan bratwurst dan periksa kualitasnya. Bihun (soun) memang enak. Pelayannya luar biasa, salut. Ramah dan tidak merendahkan penampilan tamu. Koktail di lantai eksekutif sangat buruk karena menggunakan sirup jeruk nipis (apakah mahal sekali jika menggunakan jeruk nipis segar), kurang tercampur, dan tidak diberi hiasan. Suasananya nyaman dan tenang."

Bantal ada 4, tapi yang 2 terasa keras sekali bikin sakit leher. Wifi putus nyambung padahal provider saya sering hilang sinyal saat berada di kamar. Pesan G-food juga harus ambil ke “lobby G” yang beda gedung dari hotel ini dan jaraknya cukup jauh. Harusnya boleh dititip di lobby utama atau bagian concierge agar memudahkan tamu. Kolam renang kecil, ada beberapa mainan di sekitar kolam renang tapi ga nemu kids club-nya. Dari semua hotel Pullman mungkin hotel ini yang terasa kurang “luas”.

"767.","Handi Suyadi","806","2023-01-21","4","Kamar Mandi Berukuran Kecil Menginap di sini karena kakak saya menikah di hotel ini. Agar tidak repot maka diputuskan untuk menginap di hotel yang sama. Kamar hotel cukup besar dan nyaman. Lightning sangat baik sehingga tidak terkesan gelap. Tipikal hotel jaman sekarang, TV menggunakan IPTV. Sayangnya daftar channel belum diupdate. Beberapa channel TV yang sudah ditutup masih dicantumkan dalam daftar channel. Terlepas dari itu, tidak ada masalah dengan IPTV. Kakak saya memesan kamar dengan balkon. Terdengar seru karena bisa melihat pemandangan indah dari balkon. Namun dibayar mahal dengan suara dari luar gampang masuk ke dalam kamar. Untungnya kamar berada di lantai yang tinggi, sehingga suara dari luar tidak terlalu kencang. Dibandingkan dengan hotel bintang lima lainnya, ukuran kamar mandi tergolong kecil. Karena alasan tersebut, tempat mandi di kamar Deluxe hanya ada dalam bentuk shower. (Kamar tipe Junior Suite ke atas ada bathtub) Parahnya pintu tidak bisa dikunci karena pintu tidak memiliki pengunci pintu. Walaupun kamar mandi berukuran kecil, interior didesain memberikan kesan lapang. Pilihan sarapan beragam walaupun variannya tidak sebanyak kebanyakan hotel bintang lima. Tidak diketahui apakah keputusan tersebut karena alasan finansial atau karena memang didesain tidak terlalu banyak. Menu barat lumayan enak sedangkan beberapa menu Indonesia ada yang rasanya kurang bumbu (kecuali sate). Beberapa menu tertentu memiliki stall baik di dalam restoran maupun di outdoor. Ide yang bagus untuk diterapkan saat high season."

Ada beberapa kejadian yang kurang nyaman : * kira2x jam 15.00 seluruh lantai 15 ada bau tidak sedap, bahkan sampai masuk kamar. * malam hari sekitar pk 00.30 ada bunyi2x seperti sedang ada perbaikan kamar yang mengganggu tidur. * breakfast antrian cukup panjang, makanan yg habis tidak di refill (kami balik ketempat makanan tsb 15 menit kemudian), sepertinya pihak hotel tdk siap atas jumlah tamu yg banyak dan kekurangan staff * pagi hari sekitar pk 10.00 air panas tidak keluar, setelah telp ke front desk baru di perbaiki dan air panas mengalir sekitar pk 10.45. Makanan di grand central kurang banyak variasinya. Overall okay lah berlibur di Bandung dgn menginap di Pullman."
"770.","dy ara","72","2024-01-21","4","Tidak menginap, hanya berkunjung, jika baru kesini agak bingung membedakan Ibis dan Pullman karena hotel ini jadi satu komplek, cari lokasi meeting room juga agak bingung karena banyak tempat dan jalan, akses dengan eskalator dan lift"

"773.","Khazanah Fadhilah N","425","2024-01-21","4","Hotel yang strategis di pusat Kota Bandung. Saking luasnya bisa membuat tersesat seperti dalam labirin. Sering dipakai sebagai lokasi education fair. Toiletnya gaya modern dan sangat mewah. Herannya petugas informasi di lantai lobby tidak tahu seluruh acara yang diadakan di setiap ballroom hotelnya."
"774.","Irfon Aritonang","107","2022-01-21","4","Hotelnya strategis berada dipusat kota, hanya ngak nempel pusat perbelanjaan. Kamarnya besar pakai shower. Sarapannya antri...cukup lama karena restonya kecil. Makanannya biasa aja ada sosis, ice cream dll. Hanya yg cukup sedih kolamnya imut2 dan gabung sama ibis jadi ngak nyaman. Secara umum kayaknya belum cocok bintang 5"

Walaupun di awal cek in saya baru jam 14.30 WIB lama banget nunggunya🙃 Untungnya bisa nunggu di Executive Longue, staffnya ramah & friendly banget. Kamar aku di upgrade ke Kamar junior suite🥰 walaupun ada kesalahan ketik panggilan aku yg harusnya Mrs. jadi Mr. di welcome cardnya tapii manager nyaa sudah minta maaf langsung untuk khilafnya. Ga jadi bete' karena dapat kue coklat mouse dari teteh Dita dan Dilah dari excecutive longue, kuenyaa enaaa trs teteh2nya jugaa baikkk banget hehe. Makasih Pullman Bandung! Semoga pas balik ke sana lagi enggak telat cek in lagi dan ga ada kesalahan ketik nama lagi ya 😌"

"777.","Dehan Family","7","2022-01-21","4","Hotel yang sangat strategis di kota Bandung, nyaman, staff yang sangat ramah. Hanya saja saya menunggu cukup lama untuk bisa beristirahat masuk ke dalam kamar. Saya datang pukul 9 pagi dan kamar baru siap pukul 14.36 .. selain itu, antrian lift yang agak menyiksa karena tamu yang banyak.. Apalagi ketika 2 lifts out of serviced dan buru-buru karena ada sesuatu yang harus diambil dari kamar. Walaupun menu sarapan kurang beragam, tp rasa dari masakannya enak dan pas dilidah. Makanan yang ada di restaurant Sadrasa juga enak, terutama margarita pizza dan sop buntut. Lounge room sangat nyaman dan cukup memuaskan. Overall, saya cukup menikmati menginap di Pullman Grand Central Bandung."
"778.","Erne Erniawati","9","2022-01-21","4","Lokasi hotel yg strategis, kamar bagus dan luas kamar tidak terlalu sempit dan tidak terlalu luas. Saya memesan 2 kamar utk 2 malam. View bagus ke lapangan gasibu. Hanya saja sangat disayangkan, baru 4 Jam di kamar setelah check in, anak sy di kamar sebelah (kami pesan kamar terhubung) teriak2, mamaaa ada kecooaa !!! Hah ?!!! Masa siihh ??? Saya Ngga percaya karna hotel Pullman kan hotel baru, masa udh ada kecoa lagi ? Lagi pula saya udh percaya dengan Accor, kebersihannya, kenyamanannya, top deh !!! Ketika di cek benar saja ada kecoa ukuran kecil, mau matiin kecoa ga pada berani karna kita perempuan semua. Setelah cari2 sesuatu, akhirnya nemu botol bekas minuman anak, kecoa nya saya tutup dgn botol, dan botolnya saya tutup biar ngga berkeliaran. Dan ketika saya check out di tgl 12 feb, saya simpan botolnya di meja utk saya perlihatkan sebagai bukti."
"779.","Riel 90","3","2022-01-21","4","Kamarnya bagus & bersih, lengkap semua. Resepsionis sangat ramah tapi saran saja ada antrian khusus untuk yang mau check out, jadi tidak perlu antri lama hanya untuk check out. Aman higienis karena sedang pandemi begini, mau berenang juga harus daftar dulu, tapi sayang tidak ada staff yang jaga di kolam jadi tetap cukup banyak juga yang berenang."

Layanan oke sih. Maaf tidak bisa cerita banyak krn ga pada makan juga, cuma ngopi aja. Oiya untuk area toilet dan musholla lumayan yah jalannya kalo dari area lobi yg outdoor nya. Kalo lokasinya ini sangat di tengah kota jadi enak banget kemana2 deket , cuman siap2 macet aja kayaknya di weekend dan hari libur"
