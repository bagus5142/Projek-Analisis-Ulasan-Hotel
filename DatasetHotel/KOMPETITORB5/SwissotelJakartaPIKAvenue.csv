"1.","lester beling","2","2025-12-25","5","Accidentally booked not aware that Accor was me managing agent. Being a new build the appliances were functional. The front concierge needs to be complimented as the man was too good. The breakfast is my favourite as I an a picky eater. Elsey who served me needs special mention. Fantastic is the description. I loved my stay and to all others that made me enjoy my short stay. Fantastic Work. Sean the GM was seen regularly at the breakfast and I enjoyed talking to him. This place is 5 stars."

We are feel really welcome and spoiled as they prepared the room with cute decorations as we celebrating our engagement. Special shout out to Suvin who really taking care of us since the arrival, during the stay, and after the stay. We feel like a queen and a king by her service. She deserves a raise. Move to the Letter Press Bar, we were greeted by Rahma with her sweet hospitality smile and explained about the bar. The Bartender, Nomin, he is so above and beyond. He is really expert with his job. The best bartender we met so far! He is so passionate with his job, the management should recognize him more or give him promotion. He is such an asset. Overall, this stay is really making us really comfortable and dont want to leave. Thank you for making a really good experience for us ❤️"

From check-in to check-out, everyone was friendly, courteous, and always ready to assist with a smile. Special thanks to Bisma, whose warm hospitality and professionalism made me feel welcome and well taken care of throughout my stay. Kudos to the Swissôtel team for going the extra mile to ensure everything was perfect — it truly felt like a home away from home. Highly recommended!"
"4.","Sylvia Sasmita","7","2025-11-01","2","The room is small, the condition of shower is poor, the shower is broken. The room is smelly. This is not 5 star hotel standard should be. The next day, my concerns above have been taken care by the hotel maintenance team. They repaired the shower without I have to report them directly. It was a surprise actions and great experience for me because it was proved that the hotel really genuinely care about their customers. It was a warmth gesture and I truly appreciated the great responsive and positive reaction they have shown to customers. This is a true value of 5 star hotel ahould be. Their actions have proven what the great 5 stars hotel is about."
"5.","dq","988","2025-12-01","5","Stayed for a night, check in process was smooth as we were in a group. Thankfully, we could get early check in too. Overall services were good. Lift lobbies at room floors are very dim, supposedly on purpose for the 5-star allure. Room and amenities are nice. I really like the scent of the body wash/shampoo they provide! Bed was comfy. Breakfast the next morning was nice too with a good amount of options. The Mac & cheese was surprisingly very nice! Smoothies were great too. Overall had a good experience."
"6.","Regina T","8","2025-11-01","5","This hotel truly impressed us—clean rooms, great location, and incredibly friendly staff. Huge thanks to Aida, Sarah, Natasha, and Cynthia for their attentive service. But the real star? The breakfast buffet. It’s probably the best in town, with an enormous variety of dishes, fresh juices, and traditional jamu. Our morning felt like a feast! We loved our stay and honestly wish we had booked a few more nights."

"8.","Oumaima Aerrache","40","2025-12-01","5","I had an amazing experience thanks to Bishma. I accidentally booked the wrong date, and he handled everything with so much professionalism and kindness. He helped me cancel the booking free of charge, even though it was completely my mistake. On top of that, he upgraded me to a bigger suite, which was such a thoughtful surprise. His service was efficient, friendly, and truly exceptional. Thank you, Bishma, for making everything so easy and for turning a stressful situation into such a positive experience!"

"10.","Benedictus Nicolas Janto","6","2025-10-01","5","I stayed for a few nights, and every day felt effortless. Housekeeping was always on point, the breakfast had new things to try, and the staff remembered me when I came down to the lobby. That kind of small connection makes a stay feel more personal. The best part though is how easy it was to get around — whether I wanted to go to the airport or just stay around PIK, it all worked out without stress."
"11.","King Seng Lu","13","2025-09-01","5","I had a truly pleasant stay at Swissôtel PIK Jakarta. From the moment I arrived, the check-in process was smooth and efficient, with the front desk team warmly welcoming me and making me feel at home. The room was clean, spacious, and well-appointed, with comfortable bedding and all the amenities I needed for a relaxing stay. The facilities were excellent — I particularly enjoyed the fitness centre, as well as the variety and quality of the breakfast spread. The staff throughout the hotel, from housekeeping to the restaurant team, were consistently attentive, friendly, and ready to help with any request. The hotel’s location in PIK is also very convenient, with easy access to great dining and shopping options. Overall, my experience was highly enjoyable and I would gladly recommend Swissôtel PIK Jakarta to anyone looking for a comfortable and welcoming place to stay in the city. I look forward to returning on my next trip to Jakarta."

"15.","Annisa Sidi","13","2025-10-01","5","We stayed for a family staycation for one night. Very nice hotel attached to a small shopping mall with proximity to Pantjoran PIK with nice boardwalks. Hotel personnel was very welcoming. No problem at all requesting extra pillows from an extensive pillow menu. We also got free children's amenities in the form of DIY hot chocolate milk - a lot of fun for the little one."

"17.","Muhammad Almernate","9","2025-10-01","5","Menginap di Swissôtel PIK Avenue benar-benar memberikan pengalaman yang nyaman dan berkelas. Kamarnya luas, modern, dan dirancang dengan sentuhan elegan khas Swissôtel yang memadukan kemewahan dan kenyamanan. Tempat tidurnya sangat empuk dengan linen berkualitas tinggi, membuat istirahat jadi lebih maksimal. Dari segi fasilitas, kamar dilengkapi dengan TV layar lebar, meja kerja yang nyaman, mesin pembuat kopi/teh, serta kamar mandi luas dengan shower dan bathtub modern.

"19.","Tessa Widjaja","419","2025-11-01","5","Letaknya bersebelahan dengan Mall PIK Avenue dalam satu kompleks gedung. Jadi bisa jalan kaki ke sana. Lobby-nya cukup besar, resepsionisnya bisa berbahasa mandarin dengan fasih dan memang selama saya di sana banyak tamu dari China daratan. Ukuran kamarnya cukup luas walaupun tipe yang standard. Masih ada sofa kecil untuk 2 orang di sana, lemari dengan bentuk yang unik tempat menyimpan gelas dan coffee maker. Tempat tidur nyaman. Kamar mandi juga bersih. Saya suka kaca pembatasnya dengan area kamar, tanpa tirai jadi lebih bersih dan rapi dilihatnya, tapi dengan pengaturan di saklar, kaca yang bening bisa jadi gelap/tidak tembus pandang lagi. Area kolam renangnya bagus sekali apalagi kalau malam padahal jika dilihat dari atas/kamar biasa saja tapi ternyata cantik sekali dan luas tamannya."
"20.","Michael Limantara","4","2025-09-01","2","This was unfortunately one of the most disappointing stays I’ve had at a 5-star hotel. The room had a strong musty, damp carpet smell, which extended throughout the entire floor. I raised the issue with one of the hotel ambassadors, but no meaningful action was taken, nor was I offered a room change. The overall upkeep of the property also left much to be desired - there were stains on the towels, and the TV remote didn’t work. These are basic standards one would expect a hotel of this class to maintain. The only highlight of my stay was the breakfast. The buffet offered a wide selection of local dishes, and the food itself was tasty and enjoyable. Overall, while the breakfast experience was positive, the poor room condition, lack of responsiveness, and substandard upkeep made this stay fall far short of 5-star expectations or even a solid 4-star hotel."
"21.","salahe","12","2025-11-01","5","I had an amazing stay at this Swissôtel, the hotel is convenient, next to the airport, attached to a mall, the facilities are super great ( gym and swimming pool ++), the rooms are very modern and enjoyable. Special message to the executive lounge, I have never been received that well in any other Accor hotel lounge so my compliments to Regina and Ashley that made my experience there memorable. Will for sure come back!!"

Rooms were big enough with big showers and toilets and good amenities. Bed was super comfortable along with the pillows Service was great, everyone greeted, smiled and was friendly Breakfast was okay. Nothing too amazing but did the job. Would have liked more options on the buffet Overall really nice hotel in a prime spot in PIK and next to the mall as well. Great stay"

"28.","trons12","1","2025-10-01","5","Swissôtel PIK Avenue benar-benar memberikan pengalaman menginap yang mewah dan berkesan. Dari pertama masuk kamar, langsung terasa suasana yang hangat dan elegan. Interiornya modern dengan desain yang menenangkan, membuat tamu merasa seperti di rumah sendiri namun tetap berkelas hotel bintang lima. Kenyamanan jadi poin utama: tempat tidur empuk, pencahayaan kamar pas, serta fasilitas lengkap mulai dari coffee machine, minibar, hingga kamar mandi dengan amenities premium. Ditambah lagi, kebersihannya benar-benar terjaga, sehingga bikin betah untuk beristirahat. Yang paling menyenangkan adalah view dari kamar. Menatap city view PIK atau sunset di kejauhan jadi momen yang tidak terlupakan. Ditambah dengan pelayanan staf yang profesional, ramah, dan selalu siap membantu, membuat seluruh pengalaman menginap terasa sempurna."

"30.","Gladys Mariska","2","2025-09-01","5","I really enjoyed the Executive Lounge during my stay. The staff were super friendly and made me feel welcome. The lounge itself was quiet and comfortable, a great spot to unwind or get some work done. The snacks and drinks were nice, especially in the evening.

"35.","Amirah","93","2025-11-01","1","My family have stayed at Swissôtel Jakarta PIK Avenue several times before and usually enjoyed our experience, but our most recent stay was very disappointing. During this visit there were multiple service lapses, from poor coordination between reception and concierge to maintenance issues across different rooms. Despite raising our concerns several times, nothing was properly followed up. Our luggage was left unattended at the concierge for an entire day, which was concerning from a safety point of view. We also experienced repeated problems with faulty room locks, cleanliness, drainage smells, and a general lack of attention to detail. Even the complimentary parking registration was mishandled, resulting in unnecessary charges due to the hotel’s mistake, and there was no proper refund or follow-up after the error was acknowledged. What was most disappointing was the absence of any meaningful service recovery or apology despite the repeated issues. It felt as though the staff and management lacked accountability and urgency throughout our stay. I sincerely hope the management reviews these lapses seriously, as it is disappointing to see such a decline in service standards at what used to be one of our favourite hotels in Jakarta."
"36.","Kekas","1","2025-09-01","5","One of the best hotel experiences I’ve had in Jakarta. The location is perfect, right next to the mall, and the facilities are top-notch. The breakfast buffet had so many delicious options. Truly a 5-star experience!"

"39.","cindy widjaja","17","2025-12-01","1","Concierge terburuk yang pernah saya ketahui. Kirim bunga ke hotel, sudah ada tanda terima dari pihak hotel, namun bunga bisa tidak sampai ke tujuan. Alesannya kurir bilang titip di concierge. Halo? Apakah kurir bunga bisa naik ke kamar langsung? Tentu tidak bisa, makanya bunga tsb dititip di concierge. Itu adalah tugas concierge untuk anter bunga ke kamar."

The room was spacious, spotless, and incredibly comfortable – the bed was an absolute dream, making it hard to leave each morning! Breakfast was a true highlight, offering a massive variety of dishes from five different cuisines. Every morning felt like a new culinary adventure – our taste buds were genuinely thrilled. The restaurant and bar area by the pool quickly became our favorite spot. It’s the perfect combination of delicious food, refreshing drinks, and a beautiful poolside view. Huge shout-out to the chefs – every meal was prepared to perfection. Service throughout our stay was truly five-star. The staff were generous, attentive, and warm-hearted, always going the extra mile to make us feel welcome and cared for. Special thanks to Nura, Gilang, Bagus, and Kautsar – your kindness and professionalism made our experience unforgettable. (We wish we could remember all the names to thank everyone individually!)

"135.","B S","822","2025-08-01","4","Check-in was fast. Got a stingy upgrade. It was only a high floor upgrade.Other benefits as a platinum member include free breakfast and free lounge access The room has a very luxurious feel, but it also feels very compact. It's packed because there's a sofa, table, and chairs that work together with a cupboard for the minibar. You can still open your suitcase. The walls are all wood paneled and the wallpaper is plain. The TV in the room is large. The bathroom mirror is equipped with smart glass that can fog up when turned on. The bathroom is standard-sized, but unfortunately, mine sometimes leaked, sometimes not. Complete amenities with Purovel towels, standard Swissôtel amenities. The facilities are connected to the PIK Avenue Mall, gym, spa, and swimming pool. The pool is not large but the color combination is nice. The gym is spacious and feels empty, but there's nothing special about it. The lounge doesn't offer afternoon tea, only all-day drinks and evening cocktails. The evening cocktails include liquor, rice, green beans with bacon, chicken cooked in coconut milk, spicy beef, cheese, nuts, fish soup, corn on the cob, chicken steak, cold cuts, smoked salmon tartlet, bacon egg, salad, various hummus, duck salad, tiramisu, crème brûlée, and pistachio éclair. The selection isn't extensive, but the quality of the hot food is excellent, especially the meats. Breakfast is at Chinese National (the restaurant's name). Swissotel PIK is smart, as a 5-star restaurant requires several specialty restaurants. They created one large restaurant with various concepts to save on kitchen space and several dishes. The breakfast options are quite extensive and the flavors are quite good, but not memorable. The restaurant's interior is nice, with a gothic feel in some areas. The menu: 1. Noodle station: lontong sayur (rice cake with vegetables), opor ayam (chicken in coconut milk), boiled egg, Hainanese rice, black sticky rice porridge 2. Dim sum Sum, juice, smoothies, various fruits, morning rainbow, Swiss chocolate, milk, cereal 3. Parfait, yogurt, cold cuts, salad, cheese, herbal drinks, fruit, egg station, oatmeal 4. Bean tomato, quiche, okra, hash browns, sausage, vermicelli, capjay, coconut fish, soy sauce chicken 5. Various hummus, Middle Eastern dishes (chicken, beef, beans, basmati rice, bread, umm ali) 6. Pastries, bakery, crepes, waffles, pancakes"

I waited 15 mins nothing happened, I came downstairs to learn that check in counter didn't know that I called. I asked then who I spoke to, as it was 1 am.-ish and was only one staff worked at that time! The 2nd room, I got changed to was on 17th fl. Suddenly the high floor existed. But wasn't available 40 mins before that ! Toilet seat was loose and came out into 2 pieces. Faucet in shower came out. Rain shower still somewhat function and lesked even I didn't use it (it made your hair wet !)"

"162.","Piter","8","2025-05-01","5","Saya dan istri menginap selama satu malam di Swissôtel Jakarta PIK Avenue dalam rangka merayakan ultah pernikahan kami. Kami tiba di hotel sekitar pukul 17.00 dan disambut dengan ramah oleh staf di resepsionis. Awalnya kami mendapat kamar di lantai 19 dengan pemandangan ke arah teluk, namun sayangnya kamar tersebut tercium bau kurang sedap seperti karpet lembap. Selain itu, catatan khusus mengenai perayaan ulang tahun pernikahan kami juga kurang mendapat respon memadai. Kami menyampaikan hal ini kepada pihak hotel, dan mereka menanggapinya dengan sangat baik dan profesional. Sambil menunggu kamar pengganti dipersiapkan, kami keluar hotel sejenak. Ketika kembali, kami benar-benar terkejut dan tersentuh—kami diberi kamar baru yang lebih besar di lantai 9 dengan pemandangan fantastis ke arah teluk dan kolam renang. Yang membuat pengalaman ini semakin spesial, kamar kami sudah didekorasi dengan indah menggunakan bunga, kue ulang tahun, serta tulisan ucapan selamat di kaca kamar. Sebuah perhatian yang sangat kami hargai dan menjadi kejutan manis yang tak terlupakan. Kami mengucapkan terima kasih yang sebesar-besarnya kepada Pak Asep, Tiffany, Cecilia, Nuril, Cecil, Ashiva, Devira, Aldo, Samuel, Medi, Fadhil, tim Guest Relations, tim Housekeeping, serta seluruh manajemen Swissôtel Jakarta PIK Avenue. Terima kasih atas upgrade kamar, pelayanan yang luar biasa, dan kehangatan yang diberikan kepada kami. Momen ulang tahun pernikahan kami menjadi sangat spesial dan penuh kesan, berkat pelayanan dari seluruh tim. Hotel ini tidak hanya memberikan kenyamanan dan fasilitas yang mewah, tetapi juga pelayanan dengan hati. Sukses selalu untuk Swissôtel. Mantap!"
"163.","Wiwiet Wijayanti","23","2025-03-01","5","Saya sudah 2x menginap di sini, dan selalu merasa amazed. Desain hotelnya keren, konsep modern...cocok dengan konsep kota modern PIK. Lobinya nyaman, dan tersedia lounge dengan sofa2 yang diatur sedemikian rupa sehingga memberi kesan privat, hangat, dan intim. Kamarnya tidak seluas hotel2 lain dengan harga yg fantastis, tapi desainnya bagus. Modern, hangat, dengan fasilitas kamar yg mumpuni. Menu breakfast beragam danlengkap bgt, sampe bingung milihnya 😁😁 dan semuanya enak. Area makannya terkotak-kotak, awalnya agak bingung jg spt labirin hahaha. Tapi unik sih memang. Beda banget. Fitness center-nya luas, alat gym banyak dan cukup lengkap. Ga cuma disediain handuk dan air putih aja, ada buah free juga di lemari pendingin tempat gym. Kalo ngegym pas pagi2 bisa sambil liat sunset 😍 Oiya, hotel juga menyediakan sepeda yg bisa dipinjam free utk jalan2 menikmati PIK di pagi hari atau sore hari. Sayangnya bbrp sepeda sepertinya kurang terawat, dipake buat nanjak jembatang sudah ngga normal stelannya."

Sama sekali tidak ada standar etika security, apalagi hotel sekelas ini yg normalnya hotel kelas bintang dibawahnya saja paling tidak security nya akan menyapa dan ramah! Apalagi penampilan security dan seragamnya juga kumal acak2an. Langsung hilang selera untuk berminat lebih lanjut ttg hotel ini, frontliner nya aja kualitas dibawah kelas losmen.

"203.","F H","77","2025-03-01","3","Overall, I was pleased with the room. However, I experienced two significant issues that impacted my stay negatively. Firstly, my room was located directly behind the bar, which resulted in loud music late into the night. Secondly, the water in the shower had a very unpleasant foul odor, rotten or sewage smells. I had to run the water for several minutes each time before the smell lessened to use the shower. While I appreciated the comfortable the room, the noise from the bar and the foul water odor significantly detracted from my overall experience."

What if there are drunk foreign guests who continue to cause trouble? Can they handle it if their body posture is too big? For the front office, the service is very friendly and helpful, only the check-in process takes a little longer. Overall the room smells really good, the view is also beautiful, my family is very happy with the view The breakfast was very varied and tasted delicious, thank you to the chefs who spoiled our taste buds. Highly recommended for tourists who want to vacation and stay at this hotel. Best wishes for Swissotel"

"221.","S Adam","32","2025-01-01","3","Pertama kali mengginap di sini menggunakan stay plus member Accor. Dengan harapan pelayanan dan kamar sama dengan hotel group Accor lainnya. Saat datang ke hotel, kesulitan mendapatkan parkir mobil. Cari parkir mobil hampir 40 menit. Terpaksa istri saya yg berada di lobi hotel meminta bantuan resepsionis hotel untuk dicarikan parkir. Padahal ada area parkir hotel di basement namun karena menyatu dengan area mall PIK Avenue, pengunjung mall parkir di sana jg. Belakangan diinfokan ada parkir hotel di lantai 6, namun karena pertama datang ke tempat ini, tidak mudah bagi kami menemukan jalan ke lantai 6. Sangat disayangkan hotel bintang 5 tidak bisa mencadangkan tempat parkir bagi tamu yg akan menginap di sana. Padahal bisa dipasangkan cone pada area parkir hotel. Dan bisa ditanyakan sebelumnya kepada kami sebelum check-in hotel untuk kebutuhan ini mengingat area parkir selalu full. Saat masuk ke kamar, saya merasa kamar di hotel Mercure lebih bagus, karena 2 minggu sebelumnya mengginap di Hotel Mercure BSD. Staff hotel ramah. Agak kecewa juga mengginap di sini & tidak akan menjadi pilihan mengginap selanjutnya. Saya member gold Accor dengan fasilitas last check out, namun kami memilih check out lebih awal karena tidak nyaman mengginap di sini. Semoga management hotel bisa memperbaiki pelayanannya dikemudian hari mengingat ini hotel bintang 5."

"246.","Brilliant Hermawan","117","2025-01-01","5","Very nice hotel located at one of the most popular area in Jakarta. Located right beside the PIK Avenue Mall with direct access to the mall. The hotel itself is located near a lot of food options in walking distance, though it's still a bit of a walk if you want to take a look around to see all the restaurants nearby. Lobby was a bit small but, the room and corridor ambience are very great. Room is clean and very nicely decorated but still retain local touches with the use of wood throughout the room. Some might feel it makes the room a bit dark, but I personally love it since it really makes it really comfy. The room is also very quiet allowing a good night rest. Staffs are also very welcoming, with the front desk called us through the room phone making sure the room is up to our liking. Great stuff. Breakfast place is great. Very luxurious yet still comfortable. Breakfast selection is wide and the quality of the food is just top notch. Very recommended to try them all or just sit and soak the ambience. Very recommended hotel if you're thinking on spending the night in the area."

The staff at the hotel are very caring towards the guests, including the waiter staff at the restaurant when my wife and I were having breakfast. All the staff there, both new and experienced, are friendly and work very professionally in carrying out their respective duties. My personal prayer is that Swissotel PIK will continue to advance and develop and that more and more guests will stay there."

"265.","rockerfellas","448","2024-01-01","4","I recently stayed at this hotel, and I must say that the hotel rooms are indeed nice and quiet. It's a peaceful place to relax. However, there were some issues with the fixtures in the room. The standing lamp was unstable and couldn't keep itself upright, which was a bit inconvenient. Additionally, the shelving in the toilet appeared to be made of wood and showed signs of rot, which raised some concerns. On a positive note, the service provided by the staff was excellent. They were friendly and very forthcoming, making the stay more enjoyable. The proximity to a mall right next to the hotel was convenient, but there's nothing particularly remarkable about it. Overall, it's a decent place to stay, with a peaceful ambience and great service, but some maintenance and improvements are needed for a truly outstanding experience."

Sewaktu breakfast juga dapat service excellent dari para staff, mulai dari dianterin ke tempat duduk sampe dijamu apa saja yg kurang... Nice experience banget nginap disini.

"271.","D. K.","390","2025-01-01","4","Location is great-quite close to the airport, malls and restaurants. Room was rather small with tiny scratches (see pics). It's even smaller than Swissotel Stamford in Singapore. It's not an issue for a solo traveller though. The executive lounge was nice with beverage and snacks options. Staff were very attentive. Great service there. Gym was ok with weight machines and 3 thread-mills and 2 ellipticals I think. However, breakfast at F7 was a let down. Thinking that the variety should be better than the executive lounge, I went to F7 for breakfast to find out that nobody escorted me to the table. It was quite busy at 8 am on Sunday. I found myself a table and went to get food while I placed my keycard and napkin on the table. When I returned, another lady guest taking my seat. Then the staff asked me if I want to move - which was disappointing cus I don't know how else I could let them know that the table is occupied. But in the end they escorted the new guest to the other table. I don't blame her cus it was the restaurant's poor management. The manager apologized and sent a few staff to serve my coffee and eggs. Food variety was ok though the quality could have been better when compared the price with other hotels in the same range. Meanwhile cooking staff barely speak English it was a tad difficult to even place my order. I would think twice whether I'd like to come back."

When I was about to go home, I feel bored because I have to wait my parents to pick me up at the lobby, then there was a young lady, I think her name was marcella? came to me and say hi so we are having a conversation during my waiting time. She was so friendly with a kind smile. At the end of the conversation she ask me to stay here soon for staycation and I would like to try it because I see all of the staff was so friendly here and I want to see how beautiful was the room."

"298.","Mr Visitor","181","2025-01-01","2","PROS: - Fast wifi throughout 120mbps. Good for working and streaming. - Central PIK location. Can walk to the adjacent mall or short taxi to all the bars and restaurants. - Breakfast buffet food was of good quality as were the drinks, juices, coffees and teas. - Executive lounge food was of good quality and cooked well. -Rooms have strong cold AC which is great but can also be easily adjusted. - Large fully equipped Gym. Plenty of space and infused drink fountain. - Pork bacon available at the breakfast buffet upon request and cooked perfectly. CONS: - While the executive lounge food was great, it was not refilled regularly. We constantly had to ask for drinks. There was no readily available water either. We had to get up, find a staff member, ask them for water, wait, receive the water etc. Why not just have bottles or pitchers readily available? - Zero food and drink available in the exec lounge through the day except tea and coffee. Most other exec lounges offer some small snacks and other drinks. -Platinum room upgrade was to a room of the same size on a higher floor. So not really an upgrade. View was of a construction site and roof. - Rooms are equipped with the latest Samsung smart TVs. However there is no streaming apps or the ability to plug in a USB drive or mirror with laptop without lag. We ended up watching a movie on our laptop. 50inch Televison wasted. - Pool area was blocked off 2 days in a row for kids birthday parties. No opportunity to relax by the pool unless you want blasting music or screaming kids. We were also told Letterpress bar was fully booked and could not be used. Wish we had been told in advance all these areas were off limits as we would have booked elsewhere. - Breakfast buffet could have tables cleared more quickly and replenish dishes faster as it took 20 mins to put together a meal while waiting on things. - Often waiting on elevators. Only 3 for the whole building. - Asked staff to help us back to our room after the room key wouldn't work. No one seemed to care or know how to swipe a card and send elevator back up. Had go all the way to reception to get the issue sorted. - We were offered a late check out as Accor Platinum members but ended up checking out early since the experience wasn't particularly pleasant. Overall, not a very relaxing staycation for a 5 star hotel. It felt more like a 3 star hotel with a 5 star price. This hotel caters specifically to large groups of Chinese people, families and airline staff. It felt like anyone else staying at the hotel had no place. It is weird because the hotel has the features to be great but has just lost it's way 🤷 Would we stay here again? Probably not. The hotel will likely post a reply to this stating they are working on improving things without any real or meaningful change. After staying at Swissotel and after a previous bad experience at Novotel Bogor, is it even worth renewing the Accor membership for 2025?"

Sudah sering menginap disini tiap tahun, hotel fav suami. Pernah di room swiss select yg lebih spacious dan dengan view lebih ok harga per malam 2.6jt an.. Kemarinan ke jkt hanya pesan yg biasa saja premier room harga 2juta/ malam,, tapi tidak disangka,, berkesempatan merayakan anniversary dengan kue coklat walnut dari hotel, kamar yang dihias . Proses check in semua ok lancar, welcome drink juga diberikan ..Staff cukup tanggap.. Sarapan cukup lengkap, walaupun kalau mau cari menu khas indonesia sperti uduk, tempe orek dll tidak ada disini... Di sarapan hanya ada :: : croissant, muffin, roti, kacang2 an, yoghurt, chocolate drink, cereal, dimsum, bubur ayam, nasi hainam ayam, mie bakso, cakwe udang, nasi, mie goreng, makanan presmanan lainnya .. buah2 an.. itu2 saja tiap hari .. Kalau tidak dapat sarapan, daripada beli sarapan ,lebih baik lunch all you can eat di chinese national , ada bebek panggang, pasta,dimsum lebih ada variasi.. namun ada corner non halal yg agak terpisah.. Tuker voucher ultah untuk member accor lebih baik disini (syaratny harus makan lunch/dinner yah) ,,karena enak banget cakenya .. Hotel terkoneksi dengan mall Pik avenue, sangat mudah cari makan atau ajak anak2 mencari hiburan krn ada amazing (semacam timezone) juga disana.. Ada satu kali hal yg patut di acungi jempol, housekeeping tanpa sengaja mengambil baju kotor kami (memang kami taruh di laundry bag) ,malamnya kami kaget langsung menelpon layanan service.. baju dikembalikan rapi dan sudah dicuci bersih dan di setrika free of charge..

Jakarta's traffic is one of the worse in the world. If you don't want to stress to miss your plane, this is a great hotel to stay at. It will take around 20 min to go to the airport even with a bit of traffic jam. 2. The staff is very friendly and professional. 3. Room is soso. It's comfortable and clean but nothing to rave about. For a similar price Fairmont will be a better experience. This is what makes it an 8 rather than a 9."

"330.","Doramoon","3","2024-01-01","4","This hotel was almost perfect with just two points that fell short of expectations: first, the bathroom smelled of sewage at night, and second, the room was freezing even though the aircon was already turned off. Now to the good part. The design was very nice. Amenities were of high quality (thick towel, thick bathrobe, thick slippers, shower gel and shampoo using essential oils). Something need to be done about the smell in the bathroom."
"331.","Dewi Hu","6","2025-01-01","1","I wasn't a hotel guest and would like to have breakfast to entertain my friend . I made a reservation called in February 02 on 16.30 and the operator told me there was no one stand by at the restaurant and advised to reserve via website. The reason I called was to ask for the breakfast rate. I made the reservation via website and no idea about the rate. The next morning we arrived at 06:15 and the restaurant hasn't opened yet and later they open at 06:30 sharp. We were amazed by the restaurant interior and was seated near the window . We took a glance at the whole food section in the restaurant and was annoyed by the water splashed on the main course floor and the dessert area. It didn't rain at all that morning and wonder why there were water splashed on those areas. Later we stopped at the noodles kitchen and ordered 2 bowl of noodles. These noodles were certainly made our day. The noodles were over cooked and weren't loose at all. For chinese who are famous for noodles lovers, these ways of cooking are certainly not acceptable. How come the 5 star hotel doesn't know how to cook and serve proper noodles with most hotel guests are pilots and stewardess ? We have tried the chicken noodles at the food street and absolutely they are much better than the famous chinese national restaurant. We didn't have appetite for other menus and paid the bill at once."

Pk.14.58 ada misscall masuk yg hanya 1xdering dan lgsg di OFF. Baiknya bs info via WA dgn sopan,jgn hanya misscall,ga sopan banget ya Staff semua tampak sibuk,bahkan sampai tdk sempat bertanya mau ke lantai brp dan menolong utk memencet tombol lift saat bareng masuk ke dlm lift and they do look so arrogant. Area depan concierge di lobby penuh dengan staff hotel yg bergerombol,tanpa menyapa dan menawarkan bantuan,lagi2 ini ga berlaku utk turis asing/english spoken person,mrk akan selalu disapa dgn keramahan luar biasa Pool kecil dan crowded,msh ditambah bola dan ban angsa entah milik siapa. Area gym cukup luas dan nyaman Kebersihan toilet kurang sekali, tutup closet kotor,tampak spot2 lumut hitam di shower area I’m sorry to say, it’s almost the worst hotel service I've ever stayed in, not value for the money.

"348.","Julian Kohlweg","23","2024-01-01","2","Grüezi. As I couldn't talk with reception, too many people waiting in line because only 2 desks for hundreds of rooms, I was not able to give feedback so I write it here... For the rate of 3.3 Million (~200€) for a standard room with Breakfast for 2 the experience was definitely not worth the price similar to Ritz Carlton and other TRUE 5 star hotels in the city. - First problem, the room was extremely cold 5° Celsius when we arrived, totally crazy? - no welcome drink - There was a wedding preparation at the pool which made the pool restaurant unusable which is unacceptable. Not communicated. - The restaurant has many staff but they forgot to bring the tea ordered and they have three different buffets in different locations so there is a lot of traffic and not enough space. - Chinese dinner restaurant and the mall also closes at 11Pm why? In Dubai for example open much longer so we had to leave to eat outside - no room service (no menu) - We had to ask ourselves for the bag transport to the room. - There is no Concierge, you have to wait in line at reception. - The rooms are not as big as you expect 5 Star Hotel rooms to be, 27m2 is just the bare minimum. - Nobody asked how our stay was, they just told us to put the key card in the box but it's the managements fault as there are not enough reception desks. All in all the hotel for us was not a five star experience and we will not come back unless we get some kind of reimbursement. In Vienna or Zurich center in Europe for the same price I get a true 5 Star Hotel with breakfast so it doesn't make sense as the salaries are much higher there. + Location is great at the mall + Massage was great + Sauna included + Friendly people"

Rooms are comfortable, spacious and well equipped. The only down side was the washroom sink, which was worn off and the water took long time to drain off. Staff is very Cooperative and welcoming, especially Mr. Hendi at the concierge is amazing,so very helpful. For the breakfast, I was a bit disappointed. There were very few options if you don't like Asian / Chinese breakfast of noodles, rice n curries etc. There should be more western options added like a few sandwiches. Such high class hotel should account for larger variety of cuisines. WiFi was generally good but speed dropped occasionally. Other than that, was a very good experience overall."

"369.","Jessica Christanti","16","2024-01-01","5","Waktu itu ke sini karna ada resepsi pernikahan teman. Untuk ukuran hotel yang nempel dengan mall, Swissotel ini bagus denah dan pemanfaatan spacenya, sehingga lobbynya tidak terkesan sempit. Untuk tema warna interiornya coklat dengan kombinasi emas, sehingga kesan hotel bintang 5 nya dapat. Tapi sayang saat resepsi itu, berbarengan dengan pasangan lain yg tamunya ramai sekali. Sehingga saat mau ke toilet harus menggunakan VIP toilet yg terdekat dari hall, yg hanya ada 1 bilik, bukan toilet berbilik banyak seperti toilet umum pada umumnya. Sehingga menyebabkan antrian panjang saat akan ke toilet. Katanya untuk toilet berbilik banyak adanya di sisi satunya, yg dekat dengan hall resepsi pasangan lain. Mungkin bisa dipertimbangkan untuk kemudahan akses ke toilet, di manapun hallnya. Sehingga pengunjung tidak perlu berjalan terlalu jauh hanya utk ke toilet."

"371.","Genta","1457","2024-01-01","3","Opulent Tranquility in the Heart of PIK at Swissôtel Jakarta My recent retreat to Swissôtel Jakarta, PIK Avenue, where I luxuriated in the regal ambiance of the Swiss Prestige King Suite, one of the top categories, for a rate of Rp6,713,101, was a delightful immersion into the burgeoning premium PIK area. This review unfolds the distinctive features that make Swissôtel Jakarta a pinnacle of luxury in Jakarta. Swiss Prestige King Suite: The Swiss Prestige King Suite at Swissôtel Jakarta is an epitome of opulence and sophistication. The suite exudes luxury, providing an indulgent space to unwind and revel in the premium comforts it offers. Luxurious Atmosphere in the Premium PIK Area: The allure of Swissôtel Jakarta is further heightened by its strategic location in the premium PIK (Pantai Indah Kapuk) area, a thriving hub of development. The hotel encapsulates the epitome of luxury in this newly developed district, offering a tranquil oasis amidst the bustling urban landscape. Culinary Delights and Tranquil Vibes: One of the standout features of my stay was the culinary experience. The breakfast spread, showcasing Indonesian specialties, was a delightful culinary journey. The main restaurant and the lounge both provided serene settings, allowing me to savor the rich flavors in a tranquil ambiance. Service Challenges Amidst a Bustling Event: While the overall experience was exceptional, it's important to note that my stay coincided with a significant event nearby, leading to some service challenges. The hotel, being fully occupied, faced difficulties in providing prompt service, reflecting a temporary setback in an otherwise stellar experience. In conclusion, my stay at Swissôtel Jakarta, PIK Avenue, in the Swiss Prestige King Suite, was a testament to the hotel's commitment to providing a luxurious retreat in the heart of Jakarta's premier development area. The regal ambiance, coupled with culinary excellence, positions Swissôtel Jakarta as a distinguished choice for those seeking opulence and tranquility in the dynamic cityscape of Jakarta."

The food for breakfast has a great variety of option, but you can also opt to have it delivered to your room. If you want it to be delivered, you'll have the Indonesian, Continental and American breakfast as option, all of which were accompanied by fruit juice, pastries and coffee of choice. Every staff is so accommodating - they tend to our needs. On a daily basis, they do room service /cleaning, laundry and replenishing supplies. If you ever need anything to be done, they are just a phone call away. Most of the staff can speak English so it's not that hard to communicate. You can also enjoy their pools. Some are shallow, thus, kids can play there. They also have the executive lounge, which offers a more exquisite option of food. Swissotel also hosts weddings and other events. If you're someone into fitness, they have a gym there."

"380.","Askar Juara","105","2022-01-01","4","Saya berkunjung untuk staycation bersama keluarga di hotel bintang lima ini. Terletak di jantung kawasan Pantai Indah Kapuk, Swissotel memiliki akses yang begitu dekat dengan beragam tempat wisata dan kuliner tersohor. Sebut saja Taman Wisata Hutan Mangrove, Pantjoran PIK, Waterbom, hingga Pasir Putih PIK. Buat kuliner tidak perlu ditanya lagi, kita bisa mengunjungi puluhan restoran yang berada di sekeliling hotel. Jika terlalu malas untuk keluar kawasan hotel naik mobil, kita juga bisa mengunjungi mal PIK Avenue yang tepat berada di aebelah hotel ini. Untuk layanan check-in-nya sendiri, menurut saya cukup baik. Petugas hotel dengan sigap menyambut dan membantu proses check-in saya. Hanya saja, ukuran lobi yang terbilang kecil akan membuat layanan check-in sedikit tidak nyaman, apalagi loket admission-nya hanya ada empat antrean. Terutama jika kita datang saat waktu libur panjang dan padat dengan tamu yang ingin check-in. Hal ini juga berlaku untuk lift yang ada di hotel ini. Jumlahnya yang hanya tiga membuat kita akan menunggu cukup lama ketika ingin naik/turun, terutama jika kita check-in/check-out di jam ramai. Buat kamarnya sendiri, saya tidak ada komplain. Tidak terlalu luas, namun pas untuk diisi keluarga kecil (dua dewasa dan maksimal dua anak kecil). Kasurnya berukuran king bed, sehingga ruang untuk rebahan lebih luas. Tersedia juga sofa kecil untuk kita duduk duduk cantik memandangi pemandangan sekitaran kawasan PIK. Kamar mandinya sendiri cukup standar, dengan dua jenis pancuran (biasa dan rainfall). Secara umum, kesan ketika saya memasuki kamar ini terlihat sangat modern dan minimalis. Kolam renang menjadi nilai jual utama yang ditargetkan oleh hotel ini. Ukuran kolamnya memang tidak terlalu luas, namun kolam dewasa dan anak-anak memiliki luas yang sama (biasanya kolam anak lebih kecil). Kursi dan meja sekitaran kolam juga tersedia cukup banyak. Yang saya suka, lansekap dari area kolam ini sangat nyaman dan penuh dengan tanaman penyejuk. Untuk sarapan paginya sendiri, menunya cukup beragam dengan cita rasa yang enak khas hotel bintang lima. Namun yang perlu jadi perhatian, ketika tamu hotel membludak, siap-siap untuk antrean yang cukup panjang ketika ingin memilih makanan/minuman. Selain itu, petugas hotel juga agak lambat untuk mengisi ulang makanan/minuman yang habis. Semoga ke depannya pelayanan sarapan pagi ini dapat diperbaiki lagi. Kesimpulan saya, Swissotel PIK bisa jadi salah satu destinasi staycation yang perlu kamu coba jika kamu berdomisili di Jabodetabek. Letaknya yang sangat strategis, kamarnya yang nyaman, serta kolam renangnya yang indah bisa membuatmu betah berlama-lama menginap di hotel ini. Saran saya, jika ingin staycation, carilah waktu yang agak sepi, seperti hari biasa ataupun akhir pekan namun di tanggal tua."

"391.","J B","34","2024-01-01","5","Located 15-20 mins drive from the airport and literally next to the PIK Avenue mall. This hotel is convenient in all ways. The room is offering nice ambience. Food in the hotel is tasty in all restaurants they have. The chinese restaurant they have is one of the best in town. The only down part is, the housekeeping team are extremely noisy and have no consideration or awareness about the guests. They tend to leave the door’s metal lock hanging out to hold the door when they do the cleaning so they can enter every room easily, but then you will hear the loud bang everytime they go in and out every room that they clean."
"392.","Trisna Rini","26","2024-01-01","4","Hotel ini bintang 5, tapi pengalaman yang saya dapatkan tidak seperti ekspektasi dari bintang 5. Dimulai dqri saat check in, proses memeng berjalan cepat, cekatan, tapi saya tidak merasakan keramahan hospitality, hambar. Pada saat sarapan pagi, saya menanyakan apakah ada tempat untuk cuci tangan, yang dijawab bahwa di dalam resto tidak ada dan pelayan menawarkam tissue basah sebagai solusinya, sayangnya sampai saya selesai sarapan di sana tissue basah tersebut tidak pernah datang. Masih di resto tempat sarapan, saat akan mengambil makanan saya meminta piring kepada pelayan counter menu buffet, dan piring yg diberikan kepada saya adalah pirimg yang masih sangat panas sehingga otomatis saya langsung tersentak dan bilang aaww ini panas banget, pelayan sigap dia langsung mengambil piring di tangan saya dan menukar dengan piring lain, sambil bilang sorry. Saying sorry is ok, tapi ada value empati dan care yg menurut sy hilang dari karyawan yang bertugas. Sebagai hotel bintang 5 alangkah baiknya bila karyawan2 yang ada lebih meningkatkan juga customer oriented nya."

Enaknya kita ga harus masuk dari parkiran lobby hotel, kita bisa juga masuk dari mal PIK Avenuenya Krn pas mau keluar mal, pasti melewati lobby hotelnya. Kamarnya bagus, pelayanannya jg sangat baik. Hotel ini referensi bgt bagi anda yg mau staycation di Utara Jakarta, untuk makanan2,jajanan,resto,club',dll. Semua sudah sangat lengkap dsini. So, ga ada salahnya klo ada uang lebih, anda menginap dsini bersama keluarga. Oh ya..akses pintu tol nya juga Deket bgt. Justru klo dulu enaknya maen ke selatan jakarta, klo skrg sy lebih nyaman maen ke Utara Jakarta."

Saat itu sore jadi saya sempat konfirmasi kembali ke penjaga disitu dan katanya pool hanya sampai jam 6 sore jadi saya tanya kembali apakah kalau diatas jam 6 sore masih boleh berenang? Dan katanya boleh asalkan melapor ke meja. Tapi saat jam 8 malam saya mau berenang saya lapor ke meja katanya tidak usah lapor dan kalau mau berenang langsung saja. Tiba tiba saya dihampiri kalau saya tidak boleh berenang karena hanya sampai jam 6 sore. Agak merusak mood ya karena tidak konsisten sekali aturannya. Saya baru melihat di pool memang sampai jam 6 sore tapi di dalam sampai jam 10 malam sedangkan ketika saya tanya kata petugas boleh-boleh saja asal lapor. Jadi sebenarnya aturannya yang mana????!!"

Untuk lift sepertinya agak kurang banyak. Mengingat jumlah lantai dan customer, apalagi ketika kemarin menginap ada tamu VIP yang menggunakan 1 lift khusus.

"439.","Michelle Lani","26","2023-01-21","1","Dari awal Check-in lama, okay, understandable karena ramai. Namun, dibutuhkan sekitar 10 menit hanya untuk antri lift untuk naik ke kamar. AC kamar gabisa diatur, antara dingin bak kutub atau langsung panas. Jelas-jelas kamar no SMOKING, dan aku ada alergi ASAP ROKOK, tapi masih aja bau. Pas dikasih tau, katanya dibersihin ulang, tapi tetep bau. Gimana sih? Untuk kamar tidur sendiri, ya standard lah masih bisa ditiduri. Tempat tidur lumayan besar. Lokasi strategis. :) TAPI oh TAPI. Kejadian hari ini, 16 Mei 2022. Mau check-out, lift yang berfungsi HANYA SATU. Bayangin kami mau kejer pesawat dengan 6 koper total untuk 5 orang. Tapi gabisa turun. Alhasil nunggu hampir 30 menit di lantai 12 hanya untuk TURUN check out. Hebat ga tuh? 2 lift lainnya DIBLOKIR. Hanya stuck di lantai 20-25 saja. Pas ditanyain ke lobby, tau ga jawabannya apa? KARENA ADA TAMU PENTING. TAMU NEGARA. Makanya 2 lift itu dipakai untuk TAMU PENTING. Kami, tamu BIASA yang TIDAK PENTING ini (dan tamu BIASA lainnya) harus turun dengan EMERGENCY STAIRS, dari lantai 12 sampai LOBBY. Intinya, Hotel ini banyak dipakai untuk bisnis, tamu besar, tamu penting dll. Jadi kalau kamu hanya TAMU BIASA layaknya kami yang cuma memesan 2 kamar, maka bersiaplah mendengar alasan itu dan kesusahan NAIK dan TURUN lift. Seumur hidup saya tidak pernah rating satu bintang untuk hotel. Setiap hotel ada kelebihan dan kekurangannya, tapi kalau pakai istilah TAMU NEGARA TAMU PENTING dan kami yang menjadi TAMU TIDAK PENTING ini padahal hanya PEMAKAIAN LIFT... menurut saya asli super tidak masuk akal. Oh iya, banyak juga acara red carpet di tengah2 lobby. Dan saat saya ga sengaja jalan ke area yang banyak orang PENTING, pada diliatin orang penting. Ini bukan salah di hotel, tapi ya gambaran buat kalian aja, yang akan diganggu dari treatment ORANG PENTING hotel dan juga dari ORANG PENTINGnya sendiri. Berbagai negara, berbagai kota sudah kami kunjungi bersama. Aku juga ga bandingin hotel ini dengan hotel bintang 5 yang kami sering kunjungi, tapi hotel ini BURUK, bahkan hotel bintang 3 yang kami pernah kunjungi juga memuaskan. Menurut kami, ini adalah hotel PALING BURUK dari semua hotel yang pernah kami kunjungi seumur hidup kami. Terima kasih atas pengalaman buruk ini."
"440.","Tify","25","2023-01-21","1","Stayed sejak 28 feb-02 mar sangat2 baik semua tidak ada masalah dilantai 15. Cuma jendelanya aja suka bunyi kena angin. Bahkan ketika tny ke receptionist perempuan tidak dianggap karena pas mau hujan jendelanya lumayan mengerikan bunyinya. Karena merasa kamarnya nyaman saya bs tidur nyenyak, Saya extend sampai tanggal 6 maret pertama ga bs stay dikamar yang sama dengan alasan palsu dari receptionist yang lagi perempuan. Diminta untuk pindah kamar saya setuju. Awalnya gak boleh tunggu dikamar sampai saya bingung dan memperjelas baru habis gt boleh tunggu. Yg cuma sampai jam 13:00 lalu next kamar sudah ready. Dipidah ke lantai yg lebih baik view katanya, tapi ditaru disebelah dapur dari siang sampai malam kayak pasar malam orang ngobrol. Jadi saya minta pindah lagi (ps capek sekali 1hr harus packing 2x pindah kamar). Pertama telpon pindah kamar ke receptionist perempuan katanya ditanyakan TAPI TIDAK ADA KABAR. Sudah malam saya capek ingin mandi dll. Saya telpon lagi dan dibantu receptionist stevano sangat cepat tanggap dan langsung diatur pemindahan kamar maybe 5menitan aja. Dipindah ke lantai 23 tapi sedihnya lantai kamar masih kotor tidak divakum/pel untuk bagian bathroom. Dan ac bunyi sangat berisik dibanding kamar lain. Jujur lumayan kecewa sama swissotel dan receptionist perempuan yang tidak diketahui namanya. Saya tidak minta pindah kamar lagi karena ga enak sama receptionist yang sudah membantu pindah kamar dan kekotoran kamar bukan salah pak receptionist yang membantu. Hopefully suara ac bisa lebih tenang dan tidak kencang seiiring berjalannya jam."

"488.","Amirah","93","2025-10-21","1","Keluarga saya telah menginap di Swissôtel Jakarta PIK Avenue beberapa kali sebelumnya dan biasanya menikmati pengalaman kami, tetapi kunjungan terakhir kami sangat mengecewakan. Selama kunjungan ini, terdapat beberapa kelalaian layanan, mulai dari koordinasi yang buruk antara resepsionis dan petugas concierge hingga masalah pemeliharaan di berbagai kamar. Meskipun telah menyampaikan keluhan kami beberapa kali, tidak ada tindak lanjut yang memadai. Barang bawaan kami ditinggalkan tanpa pengawasan di petugas concierge selama seharian penuh, yang cukup mengkhawatirkan dari segi keamanan. Kami juga mengalami masalah berulang kali terkait kunci kamar yang rusak, kebersihan, bau saluran pembuangan, dan kurangnya perhatian terhadap detail. Bahkan pendaftaran parkir gratis pun ditangani dengan buruk, mengakibatkan biaya yang tidak perlu akibat kesalahan hotel, dan tidak ada pengembalian dana atau tindak lanjut yang semestinya setelah kesalahan tersebut diketahui. Yang paling mengecewakan adalah tidak adanya pemulihan layanan yang berarti atau permintaan maaf meskipun masalah ini berulang kali terjadi. Rasanya staf dan manajemen kurang memiliki akuntabilitas dan urgensi selama kami menginap. Saya sungguh berharap manajemen meninjau kembali kelalaian ini dengan serius, karena sangat mengecewakan melihat penurunan standar layanan di hotel yang dulunya merupakan salah satu hotel favorit kami di Jakarta."
"489.","andrew lim","13","2025-10-21","1","Menginap di Swissôtel PIK dan terkejut menemukan kain lap bekas tertinggal di atas koper berisi pakaian bersih oleh petugas kebersihan. Hal ini sama sekali tidak dapat diterima untuk properti bintang lima dan menimbulkan kekhawatiran serius tentang kebersihan dan pelatihan staf. Sangat kecewa. Jelas bukan seperti yang Anda harapkan dari sebuah merek Swissôtel."
"490.","Dewi Hu","6","2025-01-21","1","Saya bukan tamu hotel dan ingin sarapan untuk menjamu teman saya. Saya membuat reservasi pada tanggal 2 Februari pukul 16.30 dan operator memberi tahu saya bahwa tidak ada orang yang menunggu di restoran dan menyarankan untuk memesan melalui situs web. Alasan saya menelepon adalah untuk menanyakan tarif sarapan. Saya membuat reservasi melalui situs web dan tidak tahu tentang tarifnya. Keesokan paginya kami tiba pukul 06.15 dan restoran belum buka dan kemudian mereka buka tepat pukul 06.30. Kami kagum dengan interior restoran dan duduk di dekat jendela. Kami melirik seluruh bagian makanan di restoran dan merasa terganggu dengan air yang terciprat di lantai hidangan utama dan area makanan penutup. Pagi itu tidak hujan sama sekali dan bertanya-tanya mengapa ada air yang terciprat di area tersebut. Kemudian kami berhenti di dapur mi dan memesan 2 mangkuk mi. Mi ini benar-benar membuat hari kami menyenangkan. Mienya terlalu matang dan tidak lembek sama sekali. Bagi orang Tionghoa yang terkenal sebagai pencinta mi, cara memasak seperti ini tentu tidak bisa diterima. Kenapa hotel bintang 5 tidak tahu cara memasak dan menyajikan mi yang benar, padahal kebanyakan tamu hotel adalah pilot dan pramugari? Kami sudah mencoba mi ayam di food street dan benar saja, rasanya jauh lebih enak daripada restoran nasional Tionghoa yang terkenal itu. Kami tidak ingin mencoba menu lain dan langsung membayar tagihannya."
"491.","Fırat Maral","3","2024-01-21","1","Sebagai staf penjualan yang bertanggung jawab atas pasar Indonesia, saya sering bepergian ke Jakarta dan seringkali lebih suka menginap di hotel ini selama bertahun-tahun untuk menghindari kemacetan di pusat kota Jakarta, karena lokasinya yang dekat dengan bandara dan pusat perbelanjaan. Jadi, lokasinya adalah keuntungan terbaik. Namun, meskipun tarif kamar terus meningkat, layanan, kualitas, dan perhatiannya menurun secara signifikan. Hotel ini kini jauh dari hotel bintang 5, apalagi dengan nama Swissotel! Saat pertama kali memasuki kamar, Anda tidak akan percaya apakah kamar sudah dibersihkan atau belum. Kebersihan di kamar mandi sangat buruk. Selain itu, Anda mungkin tiba-tiba melihat serangga berkeliaran di meja Anda, saat Anda sedang bekerja dengan laptop. Setidaknya mereka harus menyadari masalah serangga ini, karena jangan kaget jika Anda mencium bau pestisida yang kuat yang mungkin digunakan di setiap layanan kebersihan, saat Anda pertama kali membuka pintu utama kamar Anda. Terakhir, meskipun saya selalu meminta kamar yang tenang, ini adalah masalah yang tak terpecahkan. Kemungkinan besar, manajemen hotel tidak memperhatikan atau para pekerja terlalu sibuk tersenyum dan bertanya kabar, tetapi tidak pernah memperhatikan kepuasan Anda. Terakhir, sebagai titik puncak, meskipun mereka mengklaim bahwa area kolam renang umum terkunci dan tertutup untuk tamu paling lambat pukul 1 dini hari, ada 6 orang yang bermain game sambil minum dan membuat keributan pada pukul 4 pagi tepat di sebelah pekerja Swissotel selama lebih dari 15 menit. Kejadian itu membangunkan saya di kamar saya di lantai 15! Kemudian saya tidak bisa tidur lagi dan saya memulai hari dengan tidak menyenangkan karena harus menghadiri rapat karena kurang tidur. Ketika saya mengeluh tentang hal itu, jawaban dari manajemen hotel hanyalah maaf :) dengan wajah tersenyum. Saya tidak akan pernah menginap di hotel yang tidak bertanggung jawab ini lagi dan sangat merekomendasikan hotel ini kepada siapa pun yang menginginkan layanan yang sepadan dengan harga yang mereka bayar!"
"492.","Esouw","164","2023-01-21","1","Lokasinya sangat strategis, 5/5. Lobi dan area umum dirancang dengan baik dan modern, 5/5. Sayangnya, kamarnya sangat mengecewakan. Kami memiliki ekspektasi yang tinggi, mengingat hotel ini tergolong baru dan harganya, dibandingkan dengan Mercure di sebelahnya, hampir dua kali lipat. Meskipun ukurannya kecil dan terasa sempit, tidak masalah asalkan bersih. Kebersihan kamarnya 1/5. Saat pertama kali tiba, ada semacam sisa minyak/makanan di meja belajar. Ventilasi AC berjamur. Cerminnya setengah mengkilap, setengah berminyak. Karpetnya tidak terlihat/terasa bersih karena banyak noda. Yang terburuk adalah kamar mandinya, berjamur di hampir setiap sudut kamar mandi, di meja rias, di nat, dekat saluran pembuangan shower, dan pintu masuk. Handuknya berbau seperti rokok. Saat kami kembali di malam hari dan hendak mandi; air yang keluar dari keran berwarna cokelat. Jadi kami menelepon resepsionis, hanya untuk diberi tahu bahwa mereka telah melakukan perawatan pada tangki air dan menyarankan kami untuk tetap menyalakan air sampai airnya jernih (yang sejujurnya merupakan saran yang masuk akal, tetapi seharusnya kami meminta maaf/meminta maaf atas ketidaknyamanan ini di awal). Lima belas menit kemudian, airnya masih berwarna cokelat dan sudah pukul 23.15. Untungnya, kami hanya menginap di sini selama dua malam. Saya baru saja check-out dari JHL Solitaire, yang juga merupakan hotel bintang 5, yang terasa jauh lebih seperti hotel bintang 5."
"493.","Taka T","12","2021-01-21","1","Hotelnya sangat bergaya dan lokasinya sempurna. Tapi izinkan saya berbagi cerita yang agak mengecewakan yang baru saja saya alami akhir pekan ini. Ini kunjungan kedua saya karena saya sangat menyukai hotel ini (sampai pagi ini). Saya menginap di sini akhir pekan ini dan merasa sangat nyaman tidur di tempat tidur ukuran queen sampai saya mendengar suara mengganggu di luar jendela. Suaranya tidak terlalu keras, jadi saya mencoba mengabaikannya, tetapi terus berlanjut sepanjang malam dan saya tidak bisa tidur. (Kedengarannya seperti musik tekno) Pukul 5 pagi saya menyerah dan turun ke lobi untuk berbicara dengan manajer. Manajer dengan sabar mendengarkan saya dan mengatakan dia akan menawarkan kamar lain di lantai atas dan memperpanjang waktu check-out. Saya menghargainya dan menunggu di kamar saya sampai kamar baru siap. Setelah 40 menit saya tidak mendengar apa pun darinya. Jadi saya tidak punya pilihan selain meninggalkan hotel pukul 6 pagi karena saya tidak tahan lagi dengan kebisingan itu."
"494.","wi2923","31","2022-01-21","1","Hotelnya terlalu materialistis dan staf penjualannya buruk, mereka tidak pernah menghubungi saya ketika saya bertanya tentang pemotretan pernikahan di sekitar area hotel. Mereka tidak mau melayani pelanggan seperti saya jika saya tidak mengadakan pernikahan di sana dan harus mengeluarkan biaya 8,5 juta rupiah hanya untuk berfoto di sekitar hotel. Sabun untuk cuci tangan berbentuk balok, bukan sabun cair. Lift terlalu lambat dan ramai di akhir pekan. Saya harus menunggu setengah jam untuk check-out dan staf bahkan tidak repot-repot mengatur berapa banyak orang yang diizinkan masuk lift. Tidak ada protokol COVID-19 sama sekali. Saya sudah menelepon 3 kali untuk meminta layanan kebersihan kamar dan meminta penggantian sprei, tetapi sepertinya tidak ada yang mau menggantinya. Sangat kecewa dengan layanannya! Hotel bintang 5 dengan layanan buruk dan materialistis. Pengalaman buruk. Saya pribadi tidak merekomendasikannya!"
"495.","Putra Thera","33","2024-01-21","1","Saya baru-baru ini makan malam di restoran Chinese National di Swissotel, dan meskipun makanan dan suasananya cukup menyenangkan, saya mengalami pengalaman yang sangat meresahkan. Pelayannya menawarkan kopi/teh gratis sebagai imbalan untuk mendaftar keanggotaan Accor, yang saya setujui. Ia meminta saya meminjam ponsel untuk membantu pendaftaran, dan saya memercayainya. Namun, saya curiga ketika prosesnya memakan waktu yang sangat lama, dan setelah mendapatkan ponsel saya kembali, saya menemukan bahwa semua tab telah dihapus, dan entri 'tulis ulasan di TripAdvisor' muncul di riwayat peramban saya. Saya belum pernah menggunakan TripAdvisor sebelumnya, dan pelayannya membuat akun tanpa izin saya, menulis ulasan pujian untuk diri sendiri, dan bahkan mengunggah foto dari sudut pandang saya tanpa sepengetahuan saya. Pelanggaran privasi ini sangat mengganggu, dan saya segera menghapus ulasan tersebut, yang sebenarnya tidak saya setujui. Pengalaman ini, terutama dari hotel bintang lima, tidak dapat diterima. Saya harap perilaku ini tidak mencerminkan standar Chinese National atau Swissotel, dan saya mendesak mereka untuk mengatasi masalah tersebut guna melindungi pelanggan di masa mendatang dari pelanggaran kepercayaan serupa."
"496.","Ronald Adriano","42","2020-01-21","1","Kamar bersih dan baru. Lobi agak kecil, tapi bar pulaunya bagus. Sebagian besar staf ramah. Lokasinya sangat bagus, tepat di sebelah mal PIK Avenue yang merupakan mal yang bagus secara keseluruhan. Kolam renangnya tidak terlalu besar, tapi lumayan. Area parkir basement luas. Saya agak kecewa dengan sikap sombong mereka. Sombong tapi tetap murah. Mereka menyediakan semua area parkir yang nyaman di depan lobi untuk manajemen saja. Ketika ditanya ke vallet, dia bilang itu disediakan untuk pemilik dan kapasitasnya seperti untuk 10 mobil. Semuanya kosong. Padahal 2 tempat paling kanan disediakan untuk parkir penyandang disabilitas, yang merupakan hal yang mulia. Saat sarapan bersama keluarga (kami 6 orang + 2 anak kecil), saya ditanya apakah saya tamu hotel dan nomor kamar berapa, meskipun sudah memberi mereka semua informasi saat memasuki restoran. (Kami memesan total 4 kamar). Sepertinya mereka takut tidak punya cukup uang, atau kehabisan makanan. Mereka tidak perlu melakukan itu, terutama ketika kami hampir selesai. Kita akan segera keluar dari restoran itu, kan? Ketika saya tanya kenapa dia bertanya, dia bilang itu karena kasirnya yang bertanya. Sepertinya dia/kasirnya tidak yakin kalau kita pelanggan yang membayar (pemesanan kita sudah termasuk sarapan). Jadi, meskipun mereka sombong (dengan parkir VIP khusus manajemen), mereka juga sangat pelit. Takut uangnya habis, atau kehabisan makanan. Memalukan. Saya yakin Pihak Manajemen merasa mereka lebih penting daripada tamu, sehingga mereka lebih pantas mendapatkan area parkir yang nyaman itu daripada pelanggan yang membayar. Lagipula, tidak terlalu Swiss, ya? Penutup kunci pintu kamar Anda jatuh 3 kali selama kami menginap 1 malam."

Butuh waktu 1 jam 45 menit untuk menemukan tempat parkir (jumlah tempat parkir khusus di Pik Avenue Mal sangat terbatas). Pengalaman terburuk di hotel bintang 5 bagi saya."
"499.","Andryani Kurniawan","16","2023-01-21","1","Mengapa Anda menghapus ulasan saya tentang layanan kamar Anda yang buruk? Saya menelepon layanan kamar untuk nasi goreng pada pukul 23.10 Dan memberi tahu mereka bahwa saya akan membayar dengan kode QR. Makanan datang pukul 23.30 yang menurut saya tidak masalah. Selama pembayaran, staf tidak dapat membuat kode batang karena mesin rusak. Saya tawarkan transfer, dia tolak, katanya tidak tahu nomor rekening banknya. Jadi aku memintanya untuk menyelesaikan ini besok karena sudah larut malam dan aku tidak ingin membangunkan kedua gadis kecilku. Saya menandatangani tagihan sebagai bukti bahwa saya akan menyelesaikannya besok pagi. Pada titik ini saya berharap dia TIDAK KEMBALI. Dia kembali pada pukul 23.46 dan mengetuk pintu saya TIGA kali. Apakah Anda menghargai tamu Anda hanya dengan 10usd sementara tamu tersebut masih menginap dan bahkan belum check-out?"

Terakhir, saya kembali pukul 19.30 dan mereka meminta kami kembali pukul 20.30 dengan alasan yang sama. Kami membatalkan pemesanan dan pindah ke hotel lain.

Saat itu sore jadi saya sempat konfirmasi kembali ke penjaga disitu dan katanya pool hanya sampai jam 6 sore jadi saya tanya kembali apakah kalau diatas jam 6 sore masih boleh berenang? Dan katanya boleh asalkan melapor ke meja. Tapi saat jam 8 malam saya mau berenang saya lapor ke meja katanya tidak usah lapor dan kalau mau berenang langsung saja. Tiba tiba saya dihampiri kalau saya tidak boleh berenang karena hanya sampai jam 6 sore. Agak merusak mood ya karena tidak konsisten sekali aturannya. Saya baru melihat di pool memang sampai jam 6 sore tapi di dalam sampai jam 10 malam sedangkan ketika saya tanya kata petugas boleh-boleh saja asal lapor. Jadi sebenarnya aturannya yang mana????!!"
"554.","Sandry Tri Sumarni","5","2022-01-21","2","1. Check In : Saya menunggu 1 jam padahal datang sudah jam 2. Tapi dikatakan kamar sedang disiapkan. Karena saya memesan kamar suite swiss grand king, jadi saya difasilitasi menunggu di executive lounge. Executive lounge nya sendiri sih nyaman, ditawari minuman dan ada beberapa makanan ringan. Tapi karena menunggu utk masuk kamarnya cukup lama (1 jam) jadinya membosankan juga di lounge itu. 2. Kamar Kamarnya nyaman, semua furniture di kamar tipe suite swiss grand king memuaskan, cozy dan sangat bersih 3. Pool Saat check in saya sampaikan bahwa saya akan ke pool jam 16.00. Karena kalo mau ke pool harus reservasi dulu. Dan petugas check in mengatakan bahwa saat itu blm berhasil menghubungi petugas pool tapi nanti akan di follow up lagi. Lalu saya diantar ke executive lounge oleh bell boy. Di lounge saya juga sampaikan ke petugasnya bahwa saya minta dibookingkan pool jam 16.00. Oleh petugas lounge berhasil dihubungi dan saya sudah direservasikan pool jam 16.00. Saat jam 16.00 ke pool saya tidak mengerti apa gunanya reservasi karena pool nya rame tdk seperti sedang pandemi. Ada 20 orang di sekitaran pool (belum termasuk org yg sedang makan di cafe samping pool). Tdk ada juga petugas yg menanyakan saya dari kamar berapa. Jadi memang bebas saja tanpa reservasi. Saat saya mau ambil handuk, petugasnya menanyakan saya dari kamar berapa dan apakah saya sudah reservasi atau belum. Saat saya blg saya sudsh reservasi dari kamar xxxx petugasnya blg blm ada reservasi atas nama kamar saya. Sungguh bikin emosi padahal di lounge sudah dikatakan petugasnya bahwa saya sudah direservasikan. Akhirnya saya dan anak saya tdk sampai 10 menit di pool. Pool nya juga tdk terlalu besar apalagi utk sampe 20 orang tanpa physical distancing. 4. Sarapan Menunya variatif dan rasanya enak. Tapi petugas dan pelayanannya mengecewakan. Tersedia custom nasi goreng, saya memesan utk dibuatkan nasi goreng. Sudah diterima juga pesanan saya oleh petugasnya. 10 menit kemudian saya kembali utk follow up nasi goreng saya, ternyata belum dibuatkan karena katanya ada masalah teknis. Saya diminta menunggu. Setelah 20 menit lagi saya follow up lagi tetap belum dibuatkan. Jadi nasi gorengnya tdk dibuatkan sama sekali. Overall, kesimpulannya saya tdk akan kembali menginap di sini. Protokol kesehatannya tidak maksimal terutama di pool. Risiko penularan covid 19 tinggi."
"555.","Stella S.","8","2023-01-21","2","Kami memesan 2 kamar menggunakan 1 member Accor, maka dari itu diberikan kartu free welcome drink. Ketika di meja check in kami diinformasikan bahwa kami mendapat free welcome drink sebanyak 4 pax. Kami menukarkannya di restoran Summer by The Pool. Ketika datang, muka orang yang melayani kami (saya yakin bukan pelayanan khusus di restoran tersebut, berjabatan lebih tinggi karena orang tersebut memakai jas sedangkan waitress lainnya menggunakan kemeja pantai) langsung berubah ketika mendenger bahwa kami hanya ingin menukarkan welcome drink. Lalu dia memberi tahu bahwa voucher tersebut hanya berlaku untuk 2 pax. Saya jelas bertanya apakah bisa di cek terlebih dahulu sekali lagi apakah memang mendapat 2 saja karena saya memesan 2 kamar. Orang tersebut langsung menuduh bahwa saya insist ingin 4 welcome drinks, dan bertanya dengan ketus apa minuman yang ingin saya pesan. Saya bertanya apakah akhirnya saya mendapat 2 atau 4, toh tidak masalah kalo akhirnya cuma dapat 2, dan juga bertanya tentang buku menu minumannya, karena beberapa kali saya menginap di hotel accor dan mendapat welcome drink selalu ada buku list minumannya. Namun dia tidak memberikan dan malah kembali dengan ketus bertanya saya inginnya pesan apa dulu. Terakhir barulah waitress disana membantu menjelaskan bahwa sistem kartu member accor hanya mendapat 2 pax welcome drinks per kartu, bukan per kamar. Kalau dijelaskan seperti ini juga saya mengerti, dan tidak pernah memaksa harus 4, hanya saja informasi di awal kan seperti ini saat check-in. Hal kedua, ketika sedang kesal-kesalnya dengan service di Summer by the pool, saya dan seorang anggota keluarga lainnya melihat-lihat ke tempat gym dan tidak sengaja melewati counter spa. Terdengar bahwa ketika seorang turis asing bertanya-tanya tentang menu spa disana kepada seorang petugas, namun petugas ini malah mengeluh tentang client ini dengan bahasa Indonesia kepada petugas lainnya. Sayang sekali, hotelnya bagus, tempatnya strategis, namun saya tidak mengerti mengapa service nya seperti ini, seperti tidak ada ketulusan di dalamnya."

Untuk ruangannya juga cukup kecil. Kasurnya dua kasur digabung jadi satu. Cleanliness 4/5 Water closet tidak bisa mati, tempat shower licin. Selain itu biasa saja Service 4/5 Sangat ramah dan hampir perfect, tapi tidak mengingatkan masalah karcis parkir yg harus di cap, ketika keluar parkiran bilang data belum masuk dan kena biaya normal.

Selain sangat sedikit pilihannya, hanya bisa pilih salah satu saja (penekanan ATAU di kalimat saya, bukan DAN). Mengapa in room dining nya sangat payah seperti ini, selain itu makananya pun kurang enak, bahkan sudah dingin waktu baru datang makanannya. Terlebih, besoknya pun demikian makanannya. Padahal ini di hari weekend, tapi tetap saja makanannya begitu buruk. Swissotel bintang 5 tapi makanannya seperti bintang 1.

Keesokan harinya, keluhan saya di atas telah ditangani oleh tim pemeliharaan hotel. Mereka memperbaiki pancuran tanpa saya harus melaporkannya langsung. Itu adalah tindakan yang mengejutkan dan pengalaman yang luar biasa bagi saya karena terbukti bahwa hotel tersebut benar-benar peduli dengan pelanggan mereka. Itu adalah tindakan yang hangat dan saya sangat menghargai respons dan reaksi positif yang luar biasa yang telah mereka tunjukkan kepada pelanggan. Ini adalah nilai sejati dari sebuah hotel bintang 5. Tindakan mereka telah membuktikan betapa hebatnya hotel bintang 5."
"573.","Michael Limantara","4","2025-09-21","2","Sayangnya, ini adalah salah satu pengalaman menginap paling mengecewakan yang pernah saya alami di hotel bintang 5. Kamarnya berbau apek dan lembap, yang menyebar ke seluruh lantai. Saya menyampaikan masalah ini kepada salah satu duta hotel, tetapi tidak ada tindakan yang berarti, dan saya juga tidak ditawari untuk pindah kamar. Perawatan properti secara keseluruhan juga kurang memuaskan - ada noda di handuk, dan remote TV tidak berfungsi. Ini adalah standar dasar yang diharapkan dari hotel sekelas ini. Satu-satunya hal yang menarik dari pengalaman menginap saya adalah sarapannya. Prasmanan menawarkan beragam pilihan hidangan lokal, dan makanannya sendiri lezat dan nikmat. Secara keseluruhan, meskipun pengalaman sarapannya positif, kondisi kamar yang buruk, kurangnya respons, dan perawatan yang tidak memadai membuat pengalaman menginap ini jauh dari harapan hotel bintang 5 atau bahkan hotel bintang 4 yang solid."
"574.","Mr Visitor","182","2025-01-21","2","KELEBIHAN: - Wifi cepat di seluruh area hotel, 120mbps. Cocok untuk bekerja dan streaming. - Lokasi di pusat PIK. Dapat dicapai dengan berjalan kaki ke mal di sebelahnya atau naik taksi singkat ke semua bar dan restoran. - Makanan prasmanan sarapan berkualitas baik, begitu pula minuman, jus, kopi, dan teh. - Makanan di lounge eksekutif berkualitas baik dan dimasak dengan baik. - Kamar memiliki AC dingin yang kuat, yang sangat bagus, tetapi juga dapat diatur dengan mudah. - Gym besar yang lengkap. Banyak ruang dan air mancur infus. - Daging babi asap tersedia di prasmanan sarapan berdasarkan permintaan dan dimasak dengan sempurna. KELEMAHAN: - Meskipun makanan di lounge eksekutif lezat, isinya tidak diisi ulang secara teratur. Kami terus-menerus harus meminta minuman. Air minum pun tidak tersedia. Kami harus bangun, mencari staf, meminta air, menunggu, menerima air, dll. Mengapa tidak menyediakan botol atau teko saja? - Tidak ada makanan dan minuman yang tersedia di lounge eksekutif sepanjang hari kecuali teh dan kopi. Kebanyakan lounge eksekutif lainnya menawarkan beberapa camilan kecil dan minuman lainnya. - Upgrade kamar Platinum ke kamar dengan ukuran yang sama di lantai yang lebih tinggi. Jadi, bukan upgrade yang sebenarnya. Pemandangannya menghadap lokasi konstruksi dan atap. - Kamar dilengkapi dengan TV pintar Samsung terbaru. Namun, tidak ada aplikasi streaming atau kemampuan untuk menghubungkan drive USB atau mirror ke laptop tanpa lag. Kami akhirnya menonton film di laptop. Televisi 50 inci terbuang sia-sia. - Area kolam renang ditutup selama 2 hari berturut-turut untuk pesta ulang tahun anak-anak. Tidak ada kesempatan untuk bersantai di tepi kolam renang kecuali jika Anda ingin musik kencang atau anak-anak berteriak. Kami juga diberitahu bahwa bar Letterpress sudah penuh dan tidak dapat digunakan. Berharap kami diberitahu sebelumnya bahwa semua area ini tidak dapat digunakan karena kami pasti akan memesan tempat lain. - Meja prasmanan untuk sarapan dapat dibersihkan lebih cepat dan hidangan dapat diisi ulang lebih cepat karena butuh 20 menit untuk menyiapkan makanan sambil menunggu pesanan. - Sering menunggu lift. Hanya 3 lift untuk seluruh gedung. - Meminta staf untuk membantu kami kembali ke kamar setelah kunci kamar tidak berfungsi. Sepertinya tidak ada yang peduli atau tahu cara menggesek kartu dan meminta lift kembali. Harus pergi jauh-jauh ke resepsionis untuk menyelesaikan masalah ini. - Kami ditawari check-out terlambat sebagai anggota Accor Platinum, tetapi akhirnya check-out lebih awal karena pengalamannya kurang menyenangkan. Secara keseluruhan, staycation ini bukan pengalaman yang sangat santai untuk hotel bintang 5. Rasanya lebih seperti hotel bintang 3 dengan harga bintang 5. Hotel ini khusus melayani rombongan besar orang Tionghoa, keluarga, dan staf maskapai. Rasanya seperti orang lain yang menginap di hotel ini tidak punya tempat. Aneh karena hotel ini memiliki fitur-fitur yang seharusnya bagus, tetapi seperti kehilangan arah 🤷 Apakah kami akan menginap di sini lagi? Mungkin tidak. Hotel ini kemungkinan akan membalas pesan ini dengan menyatakan bahwa mereka sedang berupaya memperbaiki keadaan tanpa perubahan yang nyata atau berarti. Setelah menginap di Swissotel dan setelah pengalaman buruk sebelumnya di Novotel Bogor, apakah masih layak untuk memperbarui keanggotaan Accor untuk tahun 2025?"
"575.","Julian Kohlweg","23","2024-01-21","2","Maaf. Karena saya tidak bisa berbicara dengan resepsionis, terlalu banyak orang yang mengantre karena hanya ada 2 meja untuk ratusan kamar, saya tidak bisa memberikan umpan balik, jadi saya tulis di sini... Dengan harga 3,3 Juta (~200€) untuk kamar standar dengan sarapan untuk 2 orang, pengalamannya jelas tidak sepadan dengan harganya, mirip dengan Ritz Carlton dan hotel bintang 5 lainnya di kota ini. - Masalah pertama, kamarnya sangat dingin, 5° Celcius saat kami tiba, benar-benar gila? - Tidak ada minuman selamat datang - Ada persiapan pernikahan di kolam renang yang membuat restoran kolam renang tidak dapat digunakan, yang tidak dapat diterima. Tidak dikomunikasikan. - Restorannya memiliki banyak staf tetapi mereka lupa membawa teh yang dipesan dan mereka memiliki tiga prasmanan berbeda di lokasi yang berbeda sehingga banyak orang lalu lintas dan tidak cukup ruang. - Restoran makan malam Cina dan mal juga tutup pukul 23.00, mengapa? Di Dubai misalnya, buka lebih lama sehingga kami harus keluar untuk makan di luar. - Tidak ada layanan kamar (tidak ada menu) - Kami harus meminta bantuan transportasi tas ke kamar. - Tidak ada Concierge, Anda harus mengantre di resepsionis. - Kamarnya tidak seluas yang Anda bayangkan untuk kamar Hotel Bintang 5, 27m2 hanyalah ukuran minimum. - Tidak ada yang bertanya bagaimana pengalaman menginap kami, mereka hanya menyuruh kami memasukkan kartu kunci ke dalam kotak, tetapi itu salah manajemen karena tidak ada cukup meja resepsionis. Secara keseluruhan, hotel ini bukanlah pengalaman bintang lima bagi kami dan kami tidak akan kembali kecuali kami mendapatkan semacam penggantian biaya. Di Wina atau pusat kota Zurich di Eropa, dengan harga yang sama, saya mendapatkan Hotel Bintang 5 sungguhan dengan sarapan, jadi itu tidak masuk akal karena gaji di sana jauh lebih tinggi. + Lokasinya bagus di mal + Pijatnya luar biasa + Sauna termasuk + Orang-orangnya ramah"

"577.","jon tang","3","2024-01-21","2","Penulis saat ini adalah anggota Accor ALL Platinum dan sedang mengalihkan komitmen loyalitasnya ke 2 program loyalitas jaringan hotel pesaing lainnya. Ini setelah mengalami 3-4 pengalaman menginap yang tidak menyenangkan di hotel Accor bintang 5, termasuk pengalaman menginapnya baru-baru ini di Swissotel PIK tahun ini. Ia juga sering bepergian ke Asia dan Eropa untuk perjalanan bisnis. Apa yang bisa saya katakan? Kesan pertama Swissotel PIK Avenue menunjukkan gaya Swiss yang berkelas: lobinya terlihat sangat modern. Resepsionisnya sangat efisien dalam proses check-in dan membantu. Mereka bahkan bisa berbicara dalam beberapa bahasa. Salut! Lokasi Swissotel sangat bagus. Lokasinya tepat di antara Bandara CGK dan pusat kota, dan akses ke PIK dan Puri Indah dari sana juga cukup cepat. Sejak saat itu, pengalaman saya berubah menjadi seperti roller coaster. Pertama kali masuk ke kamar, tercium aroma yang menyenangkan. Hotel ini masih terasa baru dan segar, perabotan dan desain interiornya modern namun premium. Satu komentar kecil: kompartemen di sekitar rak bagasi tampak agak gelap. Dalam kondisi pencahayaan yang buruk, mencari sesuatu di dalam bagasi saya cukup menantang. Saya sarankan untuk menambahkan strip lampu LED tambahan di atasnya. Tekanan air shower cukup baik. Air panas mengalir keluar cukup cepat. Secara keseluruhan, kamar bintang 4 untuk saya. Sarapan? Pengalaman saya agak beragam. Proses check-in untuk sarapan di Chinese National yang besar berjalan lancar dan cepat. Rasa makanannya agak biasa saja. Banyak makanan di prasmanan cepat habis dan butuh waktu cukup lama untuk diisi ulang. Mungkin 10-15 menit? Apa yang lebih buruk? Lokasi saus, misalnya saus sambal dan kecap, terletak di tempat yang sangat berbeda pada hari yang berbeda! Suatu hari Anda akan menemukannya tepat di depan stasiun mi, di dekat panci nasi, dan di hari lain di dekat salad! Korsel yang sama terjadi di lokasi buah dan yogurt. Jalan setapak tepat di tengah restoran juga agak sempit, jadi sering bertabrakan dengan staf dan tamu lain dan tak terhindarkan. Keadaan menjadi lebih buruk ketika saya mencoba masuk ke lounge eksekutif dengan kartu kamar saya. Entah kenapa, kartunya tidak berfungsi. Jadi saya meminta bantuan resepsionis di sana untuk masuk. Saya bahkan menunjukkan kartu keanggotaan saya di aplikasi Accor All. Namun, resepsionis tetap menolak karena kartu yang tampaknya rusak. Jadi, saya harus turun ke resepsionis untuk memperbaiki kartu, dari lantai 20 ke lobi dan kembali lagi. Sungguh merepotkan! Masalah serupa terjadi saat saya masuk ke gym dan spa. Saya mencatat di buku masuk gym, dan ternyata, resepsionis gym bersikeras mengawasi saya memasukkan kartu ke gym. Ketika saya menempelkan kartu, pintu terbuka, tetapi dengan suara kresek. Rupanya, menurut pengguna gym lain, strip magnet pada sistem pembaca kartu pintu gym tidak berfungsi dengan baik, sehingga kunci magnetnya longgar. Namun, resepsionis kembali bersikeras ingin mengawasi saya memasukkan kartu ke pembaca kartu lagi. Saya kemudian mencoba menunjukkan kartu keanggotaan saya di aplikasi ALL, tetapi dia mengatakan itu tidak cukup dan memaksa saya untuk menempelkan kartu kamar saya lagi. Jadi pada titik ini, saya menyerah dan meninggalkan gym. Sayang sekali Swissotel yang terkenal itu. Kamarnya sangat bagus, resepsionis lobinya luar biasa, dan layanan kamarnya luar biasa. Lokasi hotelnya sangat strategis. Namun, proses DAN staf yang terlibat dalam penerimaan/check-in ke fasilitas lain agak kaku dan merepotkan. Saya bisa melihat bahwa staf-staf itu memiliki pola pikir yang agak tidak fleksibel, mungkin karena kurangnya latar belakang pendidikan yang berkualitas, atau mungkin karena paket gaji yang pas-pasan. Secara keseluruhan, berdasarkan pengalaman saya menginap di berbagai hotel di seluruh dunia, saya akan memberi Swissotel PIK 2 dari 5 bintang. Menginap di sini dengan risiko ditanggung sendiri!"
"578.","Harianto Herdiman","225","2022-01-21","2","Ada masalah saat check-in. Resepsionis mengatakan kami memesan pada tanggal yang salah. Saya kecewa dengan klaimnya karena beberapa jam sebelum check-in, saya menelepon dan mengonfirmasi reservasi dengan permintaan kamar penghubung. Layanan kamar lambat. Mungkin mereka kekurangan staf. Kamar bersih. Tadinya ingin memesan makan siang, tetapi sayangnya tidak ada makan di luar ruangan di tempat tersebut. Saya punya anak, jadi taman bermain sangat penting. Properti ini tidak memiliki taman bermain anak-anak. Kolam renang sangat kecil dibandingkan dengan Mercure di sebelahnya. Secara keseluruhan, saya mendapatkan pengalaman yang lebih baik di Mercure di sebelahnya."
"579.","Patricia Muljadi","49","2023-01-21","2","Saya mencoba spa. Pengalaman rata-rata dengan harga bintang 5. Satu-satunya hal yang bagus adalah meja spa-nya.

Habiskan uang Anda di tempat lain."
"580.","Bob Salim","43","2022-01-21","2","Pengalaman terburuk di hotel bintang 5. Check-in tersedia mulai pukul 16.00, dan resepsionis berjanji akan menghubungi kami untuk memberi tahu kapan kunci kamar tersedia. Sampai pukul 18.00, masih belum ada panggilan. Harus kembali ke resepsionis untuk meminta kunci. Tidak ada kompensasi apa pun. Saya tahu Anda penuh sesak dan ini musim yang sibuk, tetapi mohon berikan kami informasi dan alasan yang jelas jika Anda tidak dapat memenuhi janji Anda."
"581.","Joe Nagawa","237","2021-01-21","2","Jadi saya mencoba prasmanan di The Chinese National Restaurant di lantai 7 hotel ini. Tempatnya didekorasi dengan baik, nyaman, suasananya menyenangkan, dan pemandangannya indah. Namun, untuk rasa, restoran ini biasa saja. Mereka benar-benar perlu ditingkatkan, perlu menambahkan lebih banyak bumbu pada makanannya, dan kurangnya makanan vegetarian. Para pelayannya ramah, tetapi mereka perlu lebih memperhatikan kebutuhan pelanggan dan pelayanannya agak lambat. Para juru masak di stasiun prasmanan benar-benar tidak ramah. Yang di stasiun pasta selalu lupa apa yang dipesan pelanggan, dan sudah menunggu selama 45 menit dan pasta saya belum matang, begitu pula pesanan dari sepupu saya. Dan yang di Stasiun Lamian sama sekali tidak profesional. Saya bertanya apakah saya bisa memesan lamien vegetarian dan dia menjawab, Oh, sup kami ayam. Lalu saya menjawab, Tidak. Saya bertanya, Bisakah saya memesannya vegetarian? hampir 3 kali, akhirnya dia menjawab lagi, Oh, bolehkah saya menggunakan minyak bawang putih untuk hidangan kering? Lalu saya tanya lagi, bagaimana dengan saus Sichuan-mu? Apakah ini vegetarian? Dia hanya menjawab saus Sichuan-nya Sichuan. Koki ini benar-benar perlu meningkatkan keterampilannya dan cara menjawab pertanyaan dengan benar. Jadi, jika saya harus menilai pengalaman bersantap saya di sini, Maaf, makanannya biasa saja, juru masak Anda payah, tapi ya untuk interiornya."
"582.","Mock Jay","2","2021-01-21","2","Ini untuk staf yang bekerja saat kami bertanya tentang restoran Cina. Kami bertanya dari resepsionis. Kami datang minggu lalu. Kami bertanya tentang hal itu karena sudah hampir waktu makan malam dan kami tertarik untuk mencobanya. Kami tahu waktunya hanya sampai jam 2 siang untuk promo. Kami bertanya apakah perlu reservasi. Dia berkata (sayang sekali saya tidak tahu namanya), TIDAK PERLU reservasi dan langsung saja ke sana dan dimsum adalah spesialisasi mereka. Sekarang kami kembali di akhir pekan, pergi jauh ke lantai 7 hanya untuk diberitahu bahwa kami perlu reservasi! Bayangkan betapa terkejutnya saya ketika kata-kata itu terucap! Kembali ke resepsionis dan hanya perlu memberi tahu mereka tentang hal itu. Saya memberi tahu mereka bahwa kami bertanya karena prosedur umum untuk makan sepuasnya adalah dengan reservasi. Tentu saja apa lagi yang bisa mereka lakukan selain mengatakan maaf. Maaf datang kembali di akhir pekan. Maaf membuang-buang waktu Anda. Tidak, hanya maaf atas kesalahan staf yang TIDAK TAHU prosedurnya. Itulah sebabnya kami harus bertanya langsung karena terkadang informasi yang mereka posting online tidak selengkap itu, dan bukankah itu sumber informasi yang dapat diandalkan karena langsung dari resepsionis? Sedih. Kecewa."
"583.","Bryant Yudhistira","105","2022-01-21","2","Ini pertama kalinya saya di hotel Accor Group tidak bisa check-in meskipun sudah jam 16.00. Resepsionisnya juga tidak bisa menjamin kapan kamar akan tersedia. Apakah 30 menit, 1 jam, atau lebih. Apakah ini standar baru Accor??? Karena beberapa orang masih belum mendapatkan kamar, lobi sangat ramai dan tidak mengikuti protokol jaga jarak Covid-19. Situasinya sangat tidak nyaman dan akhirnya saya memutuskan untuk check-in lagi sekitar jam 19.00. Ketika saya kembali untuk check-in dan ingin mengambil bagasi, mereka tidak dapat menemukan bagasi saya setelah saya menunggu sekitar 10 menit. Tim concierge mengatakan bahwa bagasi MUNGKIN sudah ada di kamar. Ketika saya memasuki kamar, bagasi saya masih belum ada. Akhirnya setelah saya menelepon concierge lagi, mereka dapat mengantarkan bagasi saya dengan aman. Ini pertama kalinya saya memiliki 'pengalaman' seperti ini. Sayang sekali untuk standar Swissotel... Ngomong-ngomong, saya menikmati tur sepedanya. Terima kasih kepada pemandu wisata yang ramah dan penyewaan sepeda gratis. Saya juga menikmati kamarnya. Tidak masalah."

Saat datang ke hotel, kesulitan mendapatkan parkir mobil. Cari parkir mobil hampir 40 menit. Terpaksa istri saya yg berada di lobi hotel meminta bantuan resepsionis hotel untuk dicarikan parkir. Padahal ada area parkir hotel di basement namun karena menyatu dengan area mall PIK Avenue, pengunjung mall parkir di sana jg. Belakangan diinfokan ada parkir hotel di lantai 6, namun karena pertama datang ke tempat ini, tidak mudah bagi kami menemukan jalan ke lantai 6. Sangat disayangkan hotel bintang 5 tidak bisa mencadangkan tempat parkir bagi tamu yg akan menginap di sana. Padahal bisa dipasangkan cone pada area parkir hotel. Dan bisa ditanyakan sebelumnya kepada kami sebelum check-in hotel untuk kebutuhan ini mengingat area parkir selalu full. Saat masuk ke kamar, saya merasa kamar di hotel Mercure lebih bagus, karena 2 minggu sebelumnya mengginap di Hotel Mercure BSD. Staff hotel ramah. Agak kecewa juga mengginap di sini & tidak akan menjadi pilihan mengginap selanjutnya. Saya member gold Accor dengan fasilitas last check out, namun kami memilih check out lebih awal karena tidak nyaman mengginap di sini. Semoga management hotel bisa memperbaiki pelayanannya dikemudian hari mengingat ini hotel bintang 5."

Ada gosokan baju, walaupun ga sempet pakai. Ada timbangan(hotel lain jarang ada). Shower gel & shampoo wangi nya enak, soft. Design meja kerja & lemari minuman bagus, kombinasi antara kayu & kulit. Tempat outdoor samping kolam renang jg enak untuk nongkrong. Kenapa saya kasih bintang 3 bukan bintang 5? Karena servicenya. Kebetulan saya ulang tahun, jadi istri saya contact admin hotelnya dari jauh2 hari. Tapi wa hari ini, besok baru dibales & berlanjut beberapa hari. Sampai di hotel, check in lama. Lalu pas hari ke 2 saat kita mau checkout, kita di wa oleh saya satu admin, katanya kita bisa dibantu extend checkout sampai jam 2 siang. Sayangnya setelah jalan2 dari PIK Avenue jam 12.15, kita masuk lift tapi tidak bisa naik ke atas, karena akses kita dibatasi sampai jam 12 saja. Jadi kita harus ke receptionist, cerita panjang, baru akses kita di perpanjang. Kelebihan dari hotel ini juga bisa request balon(harus dari mereka, ga boleh bawa sendiri) & tulisan di lemari baju ya, tentu ada extra charge dari mereka, tapi menurut saya cukup worthed."

Terjadi penumpukan guest yg mau check out dan selalu penuh. Turun dr emergency exit dari Lt 20 ke Lobby. Pintu darurat tidak dapat dibuka hingga ke lobby, namun fasilitas lift tidak memadai. Sangat disayangkan ini sharusnya menjadi perhatian dari pihak Manajemen. Complain keras krn waktu terbuang sia2 krn menunggu lift dan akhirnya turun dr emergency exit yg sangat melelahkan. So far, menyenangkan.. very bad experience pas check out, membuat berpikir ulang utk stayction kembali di hotel ini.. Smoga bs lbh diperbaiki mengenai ke depannya dr pihak manajemen."

Ambil yg view teluk, klo pagi bisa lihat sunrise. Namun ga tahu kenapa di pukul 22.00 beberapa kali terdengar gaduh spt orang beresin ruangan, geser2 furniture, nutup pintu dengan keras. Suaranya terdengar dari arah atas kamar. Kamarku di lt 21. Jadi mengganggu pas mau tidur."
"607.","Bayu Nug","3","2022-01-21","3","Sebenarnya selama menginap di hotel ini, saya & keluarga sangat puas dengan fasilitas kamar. Namun ada beberapa hal yang membuat mood saya rusak & ingin segera buru2 pulang. A. Cons: 1. Untuk parkir mobil pun sangat membuat frustrasi, butuh waktu sekitar 20 menit . Antri masuk kawasan PIK Avenue sangat macet. Setelah dapat tiket parkir diarahkan parkir di B1 area parkir khusus Swissôtel. Namun ternyata penuh, ada bbrp pengunjung mall yang memakai area parkir khusus tamu hotel. Diarahkan ke P6, dapatlah parkir di dekat Bumame. Ternyata di P6 tidak ada petunjuk sama sekali dimana arah menuju hotelnya, alhasil sempat salah arah sampai bertemu petugas parkir yg mengarahkan. 2. Saat menginap hari pertama ternyata area swimming pool sedang digunakan private event, sehingga saya & keluarga tidak dapat menikmati fasilitas tersebut. 3. AC membuat saya bingung, awal masuk kamar suhu di setting 5°C. Saya ubah ke 25°C ternyata tetap sangat dingin. B. Pros 1. Fasilitas kamar bagus & lengkap. 2. Lobby terhubung Mall PIK Avenue. 3. Menu sarapan memuaskan, terutama untuk anak-anak saya. 4. Saya pribadi suka dengan interior kamar & area sekitar restoran. Semoga pihak Management hotel concern terhadap hal tersebut karena hotel ini sangat pas untuk staycation keluarga."

"609.","Oei Wijanarko Adi Mulya","250","2023-01-21","3","Kamar, sarapan semua oke.. Cuma bermasalah dengan parkir mobil karena menurut kami, hotel kurang memperhatikan parkiran tamu hotel.. Kami kesulitan memarkirkan mobil krn jatah parkir area hotel di basement tidak dijaga, sehingga diparkiri oleh bukan tamu hotel.. Dan kami dibuang ke lantai 6 mall. Mendadak valet parkir tidak mau menerima... Masukan aja, untuk memikirkan tamu yg membawa mobil.. Tidaklah nyaman kalau mencari parkiran memakan waktu lebih dari 30 menit. Terima kasih"
"610.","Obay Warobay","763","2022-01-21","3","Dapet promo pas pandemi, sekalian mo cobain hotel bintang 5 ini di PIK. Sebenarnya target utamanya mau lunch di The Chinese National, tp karena full book ga jadi. Lobby hotel bisa dibilang kecil untuk hotel bintang 5, tapi bnyk kursi untuk duduk. Saran parkir di basement biar gampang ke lift yang langsung lobby hotel, tanya petugas parkirnya karena lift hotelnya agak susah dicari. utk kamarnya nuasanya gelap2 gt, ada coffee makernya di kamar. Saran klo mau pemandangan mengarah ke jembatan PIK2 minta yg room 2 angka terakhirnya antara 01-22. breakfastnya yang agak mengecewakan, ga banyak variasinya untuk hotel bintang 5. Kayaknya ga akan nginep sini lagi."

Dan untuk staff penerima tamu saat breakfast (the chinese national) kurang sopan.

Kunjungan pertama saya setahun yang lalu dan Wi-Fi-nya masih sangat buruk. Koneksinya juga terkadang terputus. Sarapannya selalu makanan Cina. Akan lebih baik jika ada variasi makanan.

"654.","Issareeya Clary","106","2025-07-21","3","Saya mendapat kamar 1014, saya bertanya kepada lobi apakah mereka memiliki lantai yang lebih tinggi, jawabannya 'tidak'. Saya check-in sekitar pukul 1 pagi. Sangat lelah setelah penerbangan panjang. Ternyata kamar 1014 berbau seperti selokan! Saya langsung menelepon ke bawah untuk mengganti kamar. Seseorang mengatakan akan memberi saya kamar baru dan menemui saya di kamar 1014 untuk mengamati baunya. Saya menunggu 15 menit, tidak terjadi apa-apa, saya turun ke bawah dan mengetahui bahwa petugas resepsionis tidak tahu bahwa saya telah menelepon. Saya kemudian bertanya kepada siapa saya berbicara, karena saat itu sekitar pukul 1 pagi dan hanya ada satu staf yang bekerja saat itu! Kamar kedua yang saya dapatkan berada di lantai 17. Tiba-tiba lantai yang lebih tinggi ada. Tapi tidak tersedia 40 menit sebelumnya! Dudukan toilet longgar dan terlepas menjadi 2 bagian. Keran di kamar mandi lepas. Pancuran hujan masih berfungsi dan mengalir meskipun saya tidak menggunakannya (membuat rambut saya basah!)."
"655.","F H","80","2025-02-21","3","Secara keseluruhan, saya puas dengan kamarnya. Namun, saya mengalami dua masalah signifikan yang berdampak negatif pada masa inap saya. Pertama, kamar saya terletak tepat di belakang bar, yang mengakibatkan musik kencang hingga larut malam. Kedua, air di kamar mandi berbau busuk yang sangat tidak sedap, seperti bau busuk atau kotoran. Saya harus menyalakan air selama beberapa menit setiap kali sebelum baunya berkurang untuk menggunakan kamar mandi. Meskipun saya menghargai kenyamanan kamar, kebisingan dari bar dan bau air yang busuk secara signifikan mengurangi pengalaman saya secara keseluruhan."
"656.","Genta","1462","2024-01-21","3","Ketenangan Mewah di Jantung PIK di Swissôtel Jakarta Kunjungan saya baru-baru ini ke Swissôtel Jakarta, PIK Avenue, di mana saya menikmati suasana mewah Swiss Prestige King Suite, salah satu kategori teratas, dengan harga Rp6.713.101, merupakan pengalaman menyenangkan di kawasan premium PIK yang sedang berkembang pesat. Ulasan ini mengungkap fitur-fitur khas yang menjadikan Swissôtel Jakarta sebagai puncak kemewahan di Jakarta. Swiss Prestige King Suite: Swiss Prestige King Suite di Swissôtel Jakarta adalah lambang kemewahan dan kecanggihan. Suite ini memancarkan kemewahan, menyediakan ruang yang memanjakan untuk bersantai dan menikmati kenyamanan premium yang ditawarkannya. Suasana Mewah di Kawasan Premium PIK: Daya tarik Swissôtel Jakarta semakin meningkat berkat lokasinya yang strategis di kawasan premium PIK (Pantai Indah Kapuk), pusat pengembangan yang berkembang pesat. Hotel ini mewujudkan puncak kemewahan di distrik yang baru dikembangkan ini, menawarkan oasis yang tenang di tengah hiruk pikuk lanskap perkotaan. Kenikmatan Kuliner dan Suasana Tenang: Salah satu fitur unggulan dari kunjungan saya adalah pengalaman kuliner. Sajian sarapan, yang menampilkan spesialisasi Indonesia, merupakan perjalanan kuliner yang menyenangkan. Restoran utama dan lounge sama-sama menyediakan suasana yang tenang, memungkinkan saya untuk menikmati cita rasa yang kaya dalam suasana yang damai. Tantangan Layanan di Tengah Acara yang Ramai: Meskipun pengalaman secara keseluruhan luar biasa, penting untuk dicatat bahwa kunjungan saya bertepatan dengan acara penting di dekatnya, yang menyebabkan beberapa tantangan layanan. Hotel, yang penuh, menghadapi kesulitan dalam memberikan layanan yang cepat, yang mencerminkan kemunduran sementara dalam pengalaman yang luar biasa. Kesimpulannya, kunjungan saya di Swissôtel Jakarta, PIK Avenue, di Swiss Prestige King Suite, merupakan bukti komitmen hotel untuk menyediakan tempat peristirahatan mewah di jantung kawasan pengembangan utama Jakarta. Suasana yang mewah, dipadukan dengan keunggulan kuliner, menjadikan Swissôtel Jakarta sebagai pilihan istimewa bagi mereka yang mencari kemewahan dan ketenangan di tengah hiruk pikuk kota Jakarta."
"657.","A K","132","2024-01-21","3","Hotel besar, terlalu ramai, banyak orang keluar masuk, mungkin karena dekat bandara. Kamarnya tidak besar tapi lumayan, kamar mandinya mulai terlihat usang dan perlu direnovasi. Sarapannya menawarkan banyak pilihan hidangan, tetapi kualitas dan penyajiannya biasa saja. Jika Anda mencari suasana tenang untuk memulai hari, lebih baik cari tempat lain."
"658.","Stirling Silliphant","6","2024-01-21","3","Catatan: 3 bintang hanya diberikan untuk lokasinya, selebihnya pantas diberi 2. Sulit dipercaya ini disebut hotel bintang 5. Lantainya paling banter bintang 4 dengan potongan sudut bintang 3 dan perlengkapan murahan yang buruk: tuas patah saat check-in, kenop peredup lampu tidur tidak berfungsi. Lampu berdiri rusak... banyak hal ini juga disebutkan dalam ulasan lain. Kamarnya sangat kecil untuk standar Jakarta. Maaf, ini bukan Singapura atau Hong Kong, teman-teman. Kamar seluas 27 meter persegi di Jakarta = properti kelas menengah ke bawah, dan dengan pengecualian tempat tidur dan perlengkapan tidur yang merupakan satu-satunya kualitas bintang 5 yang sesungguhnya — itulah hotel ini. Pelayanannya lumayan, akan saya beri nilai 2,5 kalau bisa. Saya bertemu dengan sikap angkuh di meja resepsionis, mengingatkan saya pada Amerika Serikat tercinta saya — di mana kami juga membayar mahal untuk produk di bawah standar. Sama seperti di sana, banyak orang yang membayar untuk ini: hotelnya penuh sesak dan ketika tingkat hunian tinggi, bisa jadi sulit untuk menjelajahi ruang publik. Sarapannya seperti kebun binatang, sementara klub anak-anak pada dasarnya hanya berisi mainan dan perosotan acak yang berputar dari ruang serbaguna mana pun yang tersedia hari itu. Satu-satunya hal yang menyelamatkan jika Anda memiliki anak kecil adalah kolam renangnya bagus — meskipun dikelilingi orang-orang yang merokok. Spa-nya tampak bagus, tidak bisa berkomentar tentang makanannya karena kami tidak mencobanya, tetapi seperti yang sudah saya katakan, prasmanan sarapannya tampak berantakan dan akan menjadi satu hal lagi yang membuat saya merasa ditipu. Mungkin titik terendah dari titik terendah di sini: sistem liftnya adalah yang terburuk yang pernah saya temui di hotel mana pun — bahkan di gedung apa pun — di dunia: perkirakan waktu tunggunya hingga 7 menit karena banyak mobil akan penuh atau langsung melewatkan lantai Anda. Singkatnya, jika Anda punya pilihan, menginaplah di tempat lain. Setiap Marriott di Jakarta menawarkan pengalaman dan nilai uang yang jauh lebih baik daripada ini, begitu pula The Fairmont (dan saya yakin beberapa properti Accor lainnya). Dan jika Anda benar-benar harus berada di PIK, cobalah hotel lain atau pesan Airbnb."

Saya memesan melalui situs web resmi Accor, dan saya tiba di hotel sudah melewati waktu check-in, jadi ini tidak terduga dari hotel bintang 5.

"664.","Eddy Cahyadi","8","2021-01-21","3","Lokasi dan fasilitas hotelnya bagus. Namun, pancuran dan saluran air tidak berfungsi dengan baik. Kami memesan kamar premier dan air panasnya tidak berfungsi dengan baik. Karena alasan itu, kami pindah ke kamar yang lebih baik, kamar signature, tetapi tetap saja tidak membuat kami terkesan. Saluran airnya tidak berfungsi dengan baik dan air menggenang di mana-mana. Kami menderita OCD dan tidak suka sesuatu yang berantakan seperti itu. Karena ini hotel bintang 5, kami kecewa. Kami sudah mengeluh, stafnya baik tetapi tidak cukup murah hati. Setidaknya Anda harus mentraktir tamu Anda dengan minuman atau sesuatu seperti itu sebagai permintaan maaf. Tetapi Anda tidak melakukannya meskipun manajer Anda ada di meja depan saat itu. Saya telah berkeliling Eropa dan memiliki banyak pengalaman baik dengan hotel Accor. Ini bukanlah sesuatu yang kami harapkan. Jadi kami dapat menyimpulkan bahwa itu memang bukan pengalaman yang baik."

Saya membalas dengan harapan yang baik, karena saya sudah lama menjadi anggota Accor+ Gold. Namun, ketika saya check-in, email saya... tidak berarti apa-apa. Keanggotaan Accor+ Gold saya tidak berarti apa-apa bagi hotel ini, karena hotel sudah penuh (seperti yang diklaim oleh petugas resepsionis). Biasanya saya mendapatkan upgrade kamar, di sini saya tidak mendapatkan apa-apa. Saya meminta kamar di lantai yang lebih tinggi, dan beliau memberi saya kamar di lantai 9 (kamar paling bawah). Saya hampir merasa mereka sengaja memberi saya kamar terburuk. Dari kamar ini saya bisa mendengar suara bar di malam hari. Saya bahkan tidak mendapatkan piring buah/kue selamat datang seperti yang biasanya didapatkan anggota Accor+. 2 dari 5 untuk layanan (resepsionis)"

Selain itu, dinding (dan lantai/langit-langit?) sepertinya tidak kedap suara? Saya bisa mendengar suara-suara dari kamar sebelah dan langkah kaki anak-anak yang berlarian di lantai atas.
