"1.","Joel Schmit","298","2025-12-18","5","We had a wonderful stay. The room was great as expected. Notably though the Pullman staff was excellent , staff was professional and kind . We were here for a large convention with international delegates staff spoke perfect english . And the Pullman was very accommodating and I highly recomend it for a small or very large group or convention. The breakfast and restaurant was also a highlight with so many options for every taste Western to Asian again staffed with friendly, attentive staff. Thank you Pullman you for a wonderful stay! Special thanks to all the staff, but also to Wulan, and Fadhel for making our stay memorable."
"2.","Beni Kusuma Atmaja","94","2025-12-18","5","Stay here for staycation with family after long trip. Good place and location because it was close to the shopping mall. Hotel give us surprise with cake of anniversary and have cooking class for kids on Sunday. Breakfast is amazing and very organized there, not like others when in weekend breakfast in hotel very crowded but in Pullman is very calm and organized. Appreciate with all staffs, and of course the food is amazing taste and even my kids love eating there (normally very picky). Recommended hotel to stay for family vacation."
"3.","salma","12","2025-12-01","4","I had a really good experience staying at Pullman Jakarta. The staff were nice and helpful but also not better than many other hotels I’ve been to in the city. The food was actually really good! We were served by Gabby the intern, who was helpful and charming throughout. I also appreciate that they have a spacious prayer room, though it’s located a bit far from the main area. One small downside is that the ballroom area can feel a little eerie at night when all the lights are turned off and no events are happening, and the restroom around the ballroom sometimes have a slight smell. The location is very easy to access with TransJakarta, and it’s directly connected to Central Park Mall. So if you ever get bored, you can easily go shopping or grab something to eat there. Overall, it’s a comfortable hotel with great service, delicious food, and a convenient location, just a few small things that could be improved."
"4.","Sohail Mikrani","10","2025-11-01","5","I had a wonderful experience. The staff were exceptionally friendly, professional, and always ready to assist with a smile. The check-in process was smooth, and my room was spacious, clean, and well-maintained with all the necessary amenities. they upgraded the room because i am a ALL Accor member. The breakfast buffet offered a wide variety of delicious local and international dishes. The hotel’s location was also very convenient, close to shopping malls, restaurants, and major attractions, making it easy to explore the city. What stood out most was the excellent service — every staff member made sure I felt comfortable and well taken care of throughout my stay. Overall, it was a delightful and comfortable experience, and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Jakarta — whether for business or leisure."
"5.","Diandraa","3","2025-12-01","5","I had a wonderful experience in this hotel. The staff… THEY’RE so friendly, professional && always ready to assist with a smile. The check-in process was SMOOTH! Not to mention that my room was so well-maintained. I really had the best experience! It was a delightful and comfortable experience, and I would highly recommend this hotel for another purposes."
"6.","Dondy Khouw","280","2025-12-04","5","My recent stay at Pullman Jakarta Central Park was exceptional in many aspects. The hotel’s location is truly amazing—directly connected to Central Park Mall, making dining, shopping, and entertainment extremely convenient. The breakfast selection was excellent, offering a wide variety of high-quality dishes to suit every palate. The Executive Lounge was also a highlight, providing a comfortable space with great service and well-curated refreshments throughout the day. I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Duty Manager Ibu Indah, whose kindness and proactive assistance in handling special requests for my ill parents made our stay much more comfortable. Her professionalism and compassion were truly appreciated. Special thanks as well to Ibu Yosephine, Sam, Elise, and Felix for their attentive, friendly, and courteous service throughout our stay. Their warm hospitality consistently made us feel welcome. Overall, Pullman Jakarta Central Park delivers outstanding comfort, service, and convenience. Highly recommended for both leisure and business travelers."
"7.","Alfiyah Ilyas","1","2025-12-27","5","hai, kami dari kamar 535, big thanks untuk pullman spesialy untuk mbak Gita yg membantu merapihkan kamar kami, membantu kebutuhan kami selama menginap. Hotelnya bagus nyaman, dan bersih wangi. Kami extend 2 mlm dikarenakan memang hotelnya strategis. Merayakan akhir tahun di pullman sangat menyenangkan dekat dgn mall, dan makanan enak. Terima kasih see u the next trip"
"8.","Poppy Hadikusumah","43","2025-12-25","1","Kamarnya bagus, makananan enak, sayangnya beberapa hari lalu saya menginap 2 malam, namun ada jaket dan baju tertinggal di lemari kamar. Selisih beberapa jam setelah checkout saya konfirm kalau ada barang tertinggal. Tapi katanya cleaning servicemya barang tersebut tidak ada di kamar. Alias hilang. Lah kokbisa sekelas pullman begitu???"
"9.","Aurel Aurel","277","2025-12-11","1","Hotel Pullman terburuk yang pernah saya datangi. Mulai dari ukuran kamar yang super sempit. Tidak ada sekat antara tempat tidur dengan toilet dan shower room. Design kamar yang terlihat murahan. Handuk warnanya sudah menguning. Bantal, selimut dan kasur bau keringat. Belum lagi staff di front desk yang kurang ramah. Salah satu contoh kejadian, saat saya bertanya dimana tempat untuk mengambil welcome drink dan apakah masih bisa ambil welcome drink (saat itu sudah jam 18.30 wib), staff pria tersebut dengan wajah dingin dan males2an menjawab: Tanya aja kesana! Sambil menunjuk ke arah bar/lounge. Benefit room upgrade untuk Platinum member juga tidak bisa digunakan, dengan alasan yg tdk masuk akal: tidak ada tipe kamar di atas tipe kamar yang sudah saya booking (Deluxe Room). Like really?? Bayar 4 juta rupiah untuk menginap 2 malam (room only) tapi ga sebanding dengan pengalaman menginapnya. Satu2nya yang 'dijual' oleh hotel ini hanya lokasi yang tepat di area yang sama dengan Central Park Mall 1 dan 2 juga Mall Taman Anggrek. Sisanya nothing."
"10.","Yoshinori Kajitani","84","2025-12-11","5","I had a wonderful stay at Pullman Jakarta Central Park. The hotel’s location is excellent—right next to Central Park Mall, making it extremely convenient for dining, shopping, and getting around the city. The entire hotel features a stylish and contemporary interior, and the welcome sweets were a delightful touch that made me feel genuinely appreciated as an Accor Platinum member. Special thanks to Yoga Pratama, who provided excellent pre-arrival communication and arranged a seamless room upgrade. Their professionalism and attentive service made my stay exceptional. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a modern, well-located hotel with outstanding hospitality."
"11.","Benni Tedja","598","2025-11-01","4","For the love of 5 star hotel please improve the front door, either by assigning a security guard to help open the door / changing the door to automatic door or just simply leave it open. It so inconvenient.. Also the air-conditioning is not cool enough during day time, night time is fine. Breakfast menu is great, the pillow is comfortable. Location is the best part of this hotel."
"12.","Kanaya","1","2025-12-18","5","My first stay at this hotel was amazing. The staff were so friendly and welcoming. The room was clean and cozy, and the attention to detail was just perfect. Will visit again next time when I’m vacationing with my partner."
"13.","Pejuang Rupiah","2","2025-12-25","1","Padahal saya bawa tamu nginep di Hotel Pullman..tapi mobil bis kami tidak boleh nginep di parkiran hotel dan harus keluar cari parkiran sendiri..padahal sekelas hotel bintang lima lho...masak pelayanannya kalah sama hotel2 kelas bintang tiga yg menyediakan parkiran buat bis yg mengninap"
"14.","Rena Toh","8","2025-11-01","5","Excellent service from the team - from the reception, buffet breakfast and lobby lounge. Special shoutout to Aldo who was super friendly and attentive. Recommended us new cocktails to try which tasted great! He also made an effort to explain how it is made etc etc. Overall, I had a wonderful stay here and would definitely come back."
"15.","tyas melati putri","1","2025-12-25","5","Nginep di Pullman Central Park oke sih. Lokasi juara karena langsung ke mall. Kamar bersih, nyaman, dan stafnya ramah. Enak buat staycation atau sekadar nginep pas ada urusan di Jakarta. Overall aman dan puas."
"16.","Javier Pang","3","2025-11-01","5","First, the positive: the breakfast was excellent. The variety of options was impressive, with a good selection of egg dishes, fruits, and even some local specialties. The staff in the dining area were attentive and ensured everything was well-stocked and clean. Starting the day with such a great meal was definitely a highlight of my stay. (That said, the cake and coffee could use some improvement.) However, I was disappointed with the cleanliness of my room, particularly in the bathroom. There were noticeable water stains on the showerhead, which made it feel poorly maintained. Additionally, the water stopper was not functioning, which was inconvenient. On a brighter note, the air conditioning was excellent—it kept the room sufficiently cool, which I really appreciated. Also, I loved the smell of the room. It seems like a sandalwood diffuser was used, and I found it to be both calming and pleasant."
"17.","Hendri Lim","4","2025-12-01","5","Very satisfied with the staff’s service and loved the location. The bed was very comfortable and cozy. However, the surrounding area had heavy traffic. Not sure about other rooms, but the rain shower wasn’t working properly in my room, water tended to pool on the shower floor, which made it a bit uncomfortable. And the room walls were not soundproof, I could clearly hear people talking and banging on the walls."
"18.","Hani N.","12","2025-12-01","5","Great beddings! Kamar nya luas and comfy. Cuma kamar mandi nya kekecilan compare sama ruang sekamar. Breakfast buffet nya gilaaaaaaaaaa enak banget! Nyari review semua bilang enak dan iyaaaa seenak itu lorh! Bakal kembali. Mall cuma berapa langkah, ada park yg nyaman. The best combination, and the famous Remboelan and Union is next door!"
"19.","Ryo Febryo","7","2025-11-01","1","A deeply disappointing stay — worst Pullman experience to date. I’m a long-time ALL member, and this was by far the most frustrating and poorly managed Pullman I’ve ever stayed in. 1. Room readiness failure: I informed the hotel in advance via email and WhatsApp that I’d be arriving around 3–4 PM, which is standard check-in time. They acknowledged this. Due to traffic, I arrived closer to 5 PM — yet my room wasn’t ready until nearly 6 PM. If this is how they handle regular check-ins, imagine requesting an early one at noon. 2. Ignored child-friendly request: I specifically asked for a mini tent and toys for my 2-year-old. Upon entering the room at 6 PM, nothing had been prepared. No explanation, no follow-up. 3. Chaotic check-in and check-out: There are three counters — two regular and one for ALL members — yet only one had a staff member present. The queue was long, and no effort was made to open the other counters. It felt like they couldn’t care less. 4. Neglected indoor playground: The kids’ play area was shockingly bad. I’ve never seen a more poorly maintained facility. It lacked even the most basic care — a real letdown for families. 5. Subpar breakfast: The breakfast was bland, low-quality, and absolutely not five-star standard. It felt like an afterthought. If I could give zero stars, I would. This hotel failed on every front — service, amenities, and hospitality. As someone who’s been loyal to the ALL program, I expected far better."
"20.","Raditya","139","2025-10-01","5","I had an absolutely wonderful stay at Pullman Central Park! From the moment I arrived, the staff was incredibly welcoming, professional, and attentive to every detail. The check-in process was smooth and efficient, and I immediately felt well taken care of. The room was spacious, modern, and impeccably clean, with a stylish design that combined comfort and luxury. The bed was incredibly comfortable, ensuring a great night’s sleep, and the view of the city skyline was breathtaking. One of the highlights of my stay was the breakfast buffet—there was such a wide variety of delicious options, both local and international, all freshly prepared and beautifully presented. The dining experience was excellent, with staff going the extra mile to make sure everything was perfect. The facilities are top-notch: the fitness center is well-equipped, the pool area is relaxing, and the hotel’s connection to Central Park Mall makes it very convenient for shopping, dining, and entertainment. Overall, Pullman Central Park exceeded my expectations in every way. Whether for business or leisure, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Jakarta. I’m already looking forward to my next stay!"
"21.","Dian Yuthika Rizqi","5","2025-12-18","5","Dapet hotel ini pas business trip kemarin super nyaman, breakfastnya enak, staff nya juga helpfull. Checkin lancar no drama dibantu sama Mas Fadhlan, the best 👍🏻"

"23.","Prashant Gupta","336","2025-11-01","5","Having stayed in other Pullman properties, my expectations were good but this still exceeded it. The breakfast was so good. Special mention to eggy who made special veg noodles for me. Service was amazing from the time we stepped in and upto the time we left. Special shout out to Diana who made our checkin experience awesome. Being a gold Accor member we got early checkin and a complementary breakfast. My only regret is not staying here longer."
"24.","Nda Kesya","1","2025-12-01","5","I really enjoyed my stay at Pullman Jakarta Central Park. All the staff were super responsive, helpful, and friendly.

I’d definitely come back!"
"25.","Donik Ardiyanto","4","2025-12-01","5","Saya sangat puas dengan pengalaman meeting di Pullman Hotel Jakarta. Fasilitas yang disediakan benar-benar lengkap dan mendukung suasana kerja yang produktif. Ruang meeting terasa nyaman, modern, dan dilengkapi dengan peralatan audiovisual yang canggih. Staf hotel juga sangat profesional dan sigap membantu setiap kebutuhan peserta, mulai dari penyiapan ruangan hingga layanan konsumsi."
"26.","Rahaf Almughathawi","5","2025-08-01","5","A wonderful stay with an unforgettable spa experience!🤩🤩 I stayed at Pullman Jakarta Central Park and honestly, everything was perfect the rooms were comfortable and the atmosphere was so relaxing. During my stay, I tried their City Escape 💆🏻‍♀️ , which included a deep muscle massage and a body scrub. The therapists 🤍Dina and Tia🤍 were amazing from start to finish. They welcomed us with a cold refreshing drink, explained the whole process in detail, let us choose the type of scrub, and even asked how strong we wanted the massage, medium or strong. The massage itself was something else, it felt like I completely disconnected from reality. Their hands were so professional and calming, it literally melted away all the pain and stress. At the end, they served us warm ginger tea that made us feel so cozy and relaxed. It’s definitely an experience I’ll never forget and will repeat for sure. If you plan to book a spa session, I highly recommend asking for Dina and Tia by name, you won’t regret it 👍🏻👍🏻🙏🏻"
"27.","Dedi Afriansyah","4","2025-11-01","5","Our first stay at this hotel was amazing! The staff prepared a lovely anniversary setup that made us feel so special.

Sangat cocok untuk mengadakan married for couple yg mencari tempat resepsi, bahkan akad or ijab pun diuris pihak manajemen hotel lho."
"30.","tommy prayitno","21","2025-12-01","5","Hotel ini saya pilih karena lokasinya di sebelah central park tapi saya lihat ada beberapa penurunan dibanding terakhir saya menginap disini seperti closet yang dulunya pakai remote tapi sekarang tidak. Untuk pelayanan standar bintang 5. Tidak ada yang noticeable."

"32.","Mohamad Azri Mohammad Rashad","4","2025-09-01","5","I had the pleasure of staying at Pullman Plaza Jakarta on 27 Jul 25 and was thoroughly impressed by the overall experience. From the moment I arrived, the service was warm and professional. The staff consistently displayed genuine friendliness and hospitality, creating a welcoming atmosphere throughout my stay. Their attentiveness and willingness to go the extra mile truly stood out. The location of the hotel is excellent – centrally situated and very convenient for both business and leisure, with easy access to major attractions, shopping areas, and dining options. Breakfast was another highlight of the stay. The variety offered was remarkable, with a wide selection of both international and local dishes, all well-prepared and presented. It was clear that great attention was given to quality and detail, making it an enjoyable start to each day.

Dan mas2 receptionis saat itu jutek, tny malah diketusin, ditunggu aja bu ya, not even say sorry klo kmrny gak ready2.. baru kali ini loh nunggu checkin smp 1jam+ di hotel bintang 5, dont know why. Stelah dpt kamar, trnyta di toilet bau rokok, stelah dicek teknisi, katany di lt atas itu smoking room, mugkn tembus bau nya.. okelah disemprot pewangi udah ilang, eh tengah malem bau lagi, smp masuk ke bedroom, parah bgt bau nya.. pagi2 lsg mnt pindah kamar, untungny mreka handle dgn baik req utk pindah kamar, wlpn ya jam 3sore lg baru bisa pindah krn nungguin tamu lain checkout, its oke lah yg penting sy dpt kamar yg ga bau rokok. Staff jg WA say sorry utk room yg bau tsb, ramah bener utk staff yg ini, smp dikirimi amenities jg sbg permintaan maaf. Tp menurut sy pribadi, hotel ini overprice(3jt/night), gak sebaik hotel2 bintang 5 di jakpus dan di jawa lainya, mugkn terkenal krn lokasi dket mall2 gede aja? Sarapan sy kurang cocok, menu krg variatif, bangunan kamar jg gak kedap, kamar sbelah ngobrol/ketawa aja kedengeran, tiap kamar di atas pake toiletny, kedengeran suara air di toilet kamar sy (lg enak2 tdur kebangun dger suara air ngalir bokk, kaget), tidak smua staff ramah, kurang merasa disambut si klo disini (beda dgn hotel2 bintang 5 lainya yg sy pernah stay). Plus nya disini bersih, kamar luas,AC super duper dingin, dekat mall2 besar, thats it."

"43.","Nabila Putri Salsabila","80","2025-08-01","4","We stayed at Pullman for our honeymoon and got a suite, which was spacious and had a luxurious design. The room was comfortable, though some design choices felt a bit impractical, like the unusually high bed. The room also felt colder than expected. The overall hotel interior didn’t quite match our expectations of a 5-star hotel. The contemporary/pop-art exhibition throughout the hotel made it feel more like a 3 or 4-star space. It was colorful, but lacking the sense of luxury we expected for the price. The pool area was just okay, and the view wasn’t great. Breakfast had a good variety of sweet and savory options, though we had a minor incident involving a foreign object in the food and the chef apologized promptly. We also received a cake, but it wasn’t clear if it was a honeymoon gift or a follow-up to the breakfast issue. Check-in also took longer than expected. Overall, the stay fell short of what we hoped for."
"44.","Muhamad Nurdin","2","2025-11-01","5","Bagus hotelnya, makanannya enak enak suasana juga bagus untuk ketemu rekan bisnis, terima kasih juga ke mas Devano sangat baik kepada saya dan rekan saya untuk menjelaskan tentang hotel, suatu saat akan kembali kesini"

"47.","silvia kusnadi","4","2025-12-25","1","Hotel dan staff hotel sangat baik. Tapi satpamnya ga ramah, sangat ketus cara jawabnya. Updated Dec 19, 2025 Ternyata bukan hanya satpam yang tidak di training dengan baik, staff di resto nya pun demikian. Saya booking lgsg ditempat dari 1 bulan lalu untuk dinner 14pax dan pilih posisi meja, staff menyanggupi dan blg akan disiapkan saat nnti datang. Saat hari h, ternyata mejanya tidak disiapkan, meja yang sudah saya pilih waktu itu malah ditempati orang lain. Staff hanya mengarahakan ke meja yg kosong, dan menawarkan bangku tambah, karena posisinya kursi kurang 1. Tidak ada permintaan maaf sama sekali, mereka hanya menjelaskan bahwa saya telat booking dan bookingan saya di handle oleh staff yang tidak berwenang (waiters), dengan berat hati saya dan rombongan menerima alasan yang di buat-buat tersebut. Sangat kecewa dengan pelayanan Hotel bintang 5(?) ini padahal cukup sering ngadain event disini."

Lokasinya benar-benar strategis, hanya beberapa langkah dari mall, jadi sangat memudahkan kalau ingin cari makan atau sekadar jalan-jalan tanpa harus pergi jauh. Banyak pilihan kuliner di sekitar, mulai dari makanan cepat saji sampai restoran yang lebih fancy. Selain itu, hotelnya sendiri juga nyaman dan bersih. Fasilitasnya lengkap, pelayanannya ramah, dan suasananya tenang meskipun dekat dengan pusat keramaian. Cocok banget untuk staycation atau perjalanan bisnis. Pokoknya recommended banget, dan saya pasti akan kembali menginap di sini kalau ke daerah ini lagi!"

The hotel is in a fantastic location, right next to a mall, which made everything super convenient. From check-in to check-out, the service was consistently excellent. The breakfast was delicious with a great variety, and I’d like to give a special shoutout to Sam and Diana, who came down to say hello during breakfast—it was such a warm and personal touch. I also loved the welcome gift—so cute and incredibly thoughtful. It really made me feel appreciated as a guest.

Desain kamar terasa tidak nyaman dan tidak sebanding dengan standar bintang lima. Kasur tampak sudah usang, bagian tengahnya cekung sementara sisi kaki justru lebih tinggi dibandingkan area kepala membuat tidur menjadi tidak ergonomis. Kamar mandi pun dirancang dengan cara yang sangat membingungkan dan terkesan kurang higienis. Tidak ada sekat antara wastafel dan area tempat tidur, serta shower hanya dibatasi oleh kaca buram yang justru bening pada bagian bawah. Hal ini sangat menyulitkan, terutama bagi kami yang membawa anak kecil. Selain itu, lubang AC di kamar mengingatkan saya pada blower di pabrik teksti, jauh dari kesan premium. Ketika breakfast, saya mendengar kata kata kasar anjing diantara sesama chef hanya karena ada alat pemanas makanan yang gosong. Saya harap masukan ini bisa menjadi bahan evaluasi, demi peningkatan kualitas layanan dan fasilitas Pullman Jakarta Central Park di masa depan."

Saya staycation di sini akhir pekan lalu, dan langsung terkesan dengan vibesnya yang modern dan elegan. Begitu masuk lobi, atmosfernya chic dan welcoming. Staff-nya ramah dan sigap, proses check-in juga cepet. Kamarnya luas, bersih, dan didesain dengan sentuhan kontemporer. Dari jendela bisa liat panorama kota Jakarta yang keren, terutama saat malam hari. Kasur dan bantalannya empuk, jadi tidurnya nyenyak abis! Fasilitasnya lengkap parah! Kolam renangnya infinity pool, terletak di rooftop dengan view kota yang epic. Ada juga gym yang lengkap, spa buat relaksasi, sampe area lounge buat nongkrong. Buat yang lapar, restoran di hotel ini menyajikan menu Western dan Indonesian yang lezat. Saya cobain breakfast buffenya—beragam dan fresh! Lokasinya juga strategis banget. Dekat dengan Mall Central Park, sehingga buat shopping atau makan malam bisa langsung jalan kaki. Akses ke tol dan pusat bisnis juga mudah, cocok buat yang business trip. Overall, Pullman Jakarta Central Park ini tempat yang worth it buat staycation atau menginap saat ke Jakarta. Kalo kalian mau hotel berbintang dengan layanan prima dan lokasi oke, cus langsung book di sini! 😊"

From the moment I walked in, I could tell this wasn’t just a typical hotel gym — it was a complete fitness experience. ✅ Fully equipped with everything: cardio machines, weight training, boxing area, battle ropes, functional training space — everything was well-maintained and ready to use. ✅ Spotless cleanliness, well-organized changing rooms, and lockers that actually feel secure. ✅ The sauna and hammam were a great bonus — clean, modern, and relaxing. ✅ A calm, peaceful atmosphere that made the workout even better. ✅ And most importantly — the staff. Special thanks to ❤️ Gareth❤️, who went above and beyond with his professionalism and warm attitude. He even took the time to clean and tidy up equipment right after each use — that level of care is rare. Honestly, this gym alone is enough reason for me to choose this hotel again in the future. Highly recommended to anyone staying here or nearby."

I truly appreciate your thoughtful arrangement of the adorable bear and birthday cake for my best friend — it made the occasion even more special. We had a wonderful experience staying at the hotel. The location is incredibly convenient, with popular restaurants like Remboelan and Osteria GIA at Central Park Mall just a short walk away. We also loved the artistic and stylish decor in the hotel’s common areas — it added a unique charm to our stay. We’re already planning to return and bring our family and friends along next time. Thank you once again for making our stay so memorable!"

"219.","Dscrt Dscrt","1","2025-07-01","1","Overall, it has been a disappointment. As a Marriott Platinum Life member, I am well familiar with business hotels, and I can judge if they are run well or not. This Accor property isn't. Let's start with the positives: - (some of) the staff are super friendly and helpful; - breakfast is truly amazing with Japanese, Chinese, Indian, Thai and Western options, as well as a marvellous selection of Indonesian food. Without any exaggeration, it is one of the best I've ever seen in any hotel. This is where is starts and stops, unfortunately. The issues that Pullman Central Park has are numerous and serious. - staff are overstretched and undertrained. You can ask for your coffee at breakfast, and then spend - literally - 40 min waiting for it because the staff are badly organised, the coffee machine is broken and your coffee had to be brought up from another corner of the hotel etc; - rooms are small and very badly designed. You won't have a proper wardrobe, the electric socket in your bathroom won't be working (so, there will be no way to charge your toothbrush), the bidet won't be working well, the shower won't be well-designed, so it will be a pain to shower because the shower handle is of a weird shape and half-clogged; - when you place an order at the bar and a wrong order is brought to you, you will be told that you'll still have to pay for it as 'it was already put into the system and I don't know how to change it now' and they won't bother to bring you the correct order after that; these situations repeat and actually become comical. The list of what can go wrong and does go wrong on a daily basis is endless. Pullman Central Park is a 5* hotel. Well, it claims to be one, but in fact, it isn't. Forget the ghastly design of public spaces, which is reminiscent of a kindergarten; it is not about taste or design. You need to print your boarding pass, but there is no printer in the business centre, and there is no one in the business centre to help you. You end up at the reception who are very apologetic and print it out for you - but only after you sent it to their email address as they can't print it from the memory stick. You want to book a massage at their spa, but you are told no masseurs are available. I can go on and on and on... The hard product (the overall design, the fact that, if the conference you attend is big enough, you might spend up to 10 min (literally!) to get into the lift as there is no other way to get to the conference venue but through the lifts, and there are only four of them, and they are always very busy, the cramped rooms, the badly designed bathrooms, the lack of amenities - and those that are still there are the cheapest possible, which even a 3* hotel will hesitate to put out), the overstressed, overworked and undertrained staff - all that speaks volumes of how bad the hotel's management is. I won't recommend staying there. There are many better places in Jakarta, the true 5* hotels."

"240.","Ivan Sebastian","12","2025-10-01","5","Among the four Accor hotels in Jakarta that are directly connected to malls, Pullman Central Park is my favorite—because the attached mall is, in my view, the best of the bunch. A few days before arrival I received the usual preference email. I asked for early check-in and late check-out; it was noted as “subject to availability.” I booked a Deluxe Room and received a textbook upgrade to a Suite. One day before my stay, the Guest Experience Team (Ms. Diana) reached out via WhatsApp. I reiterated early check-in at 13:00 and the latest possible late check-out (official times are 15:00/12:00). They confirmed late check-out all the way to 17:00—remarkably generous. On the day, a morning event ran long and I arrived around 15:00, so I can’t comment on whether early check-in would have been smooth, but I truly appreciate the effort. Check-in itself was seamless with Ms. Wulan—very thoughtful. When I reconfirmed the 17:00 late check-out for the next day, she proactively prepared key cards so they wouldn’t auto-expire at the normal 12:00 check-out. In the middle of the stay, the Guest Experience team also shone. Ms. Michi was very thoughtful in trying to deliver welcome amenities. I happened to be out of the room, and my child had accidentally switched on “Do Not Disturb.” The next day, she even called (answered by my wife), but we politely declined since we wouldn’t be able to consume them, and she still followed up via WhatsApp to confirm. Great attention to detail without being intrusive. That confirmed 17:00 check-out meant I never felt rushed. Unfortunately, I had a 7 PM padel session in Bandung, so I couldn’t fully enjoy the late check-out window—but it was reassuring to have it. It’s not easy to find work these days—especially when you live with unique challenges. Seeing Pullman Central Park genuinely support diversity, in whatever form that takes, really touches me; as long as integrity and work ethic are strong, that’s what matters. A special shout-out to Mr. Risky, a bellboy with a speech impairment—friendly, professional, and determined. Overall, Pullman Central Park continues to deliver thoughtful service with meaningful human touches. Highly recommended."

Generally the service is poor and the rooms and staff not up to the standard I expect from my hotels. But as many of you know who read my reviews I stay up to 100 room nights a year in hotels around the world- so yeah I am fussy With that out of the way I have to say I was very I pressed with all aspects of hotel services at the Pullman Jakarta- Central Park. The check in as smooth and they messaged me on WhatsApp when my room was ready (I was there at 2pm so a bit early). The room was spacious and clean. The bed .. mattress was outstanding. Nice touches with the macarons in room as well. I most likely will not be changing my loyalty program based on this visit but I will for sure stay at this property again"

From the moment I arrived, the service provided by the staff was exceptional—professional, attentive, and consistently warm, making the entire stay truly comfortable and memorable. The hotel’s facilities are well-maintained and thoughtfully designed, offering a perfect balance of luxury and convenience. My room was impeccably clean, comfortable, and equipped with everything needed for a productive and restful visit. The dining experience was equally impressive; the quality of the food, the variety of selections, and the excellent service from the restaurant team all contributed to a delightful stay. The hotel’s location inside Central Park provides unbeatable convenience—easy access to shops, restaurants, and key business areas—making it ideal for both work and leisure. Considering the quality of service, amenities, and overall experience, the hotel offers excellent value for money. My compliments to the entire Pullman Jakarta Central Park team. Their dedication to service excellence truly sets the hotel apart, and I look forward to staying again on future trips."
