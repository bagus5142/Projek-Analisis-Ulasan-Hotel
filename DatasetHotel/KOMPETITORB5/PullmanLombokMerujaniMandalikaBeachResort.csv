"1.","Giny Pinto","12","2025-12-25","5","We stayed 2 nights in this gorgeous property in low season and we absolutely loved it! We were welcomed by Pak Reza who informed us on the hotel facilities and ensured we got booked on the shuttle going into town. Throughout our stay, he greeted us by our name and enquired how we were. The room was very clean, with full amenities and very cute. Oh and with a lovely bathtub!! The breakfast buffet was varied and plentiful with a mix from Mediterranean to Indonesian and Western food and yummy juices. We loved the pool and spent a couple of hour in the heat of the day to cool down. It was so quiet with great tunes playing in the background. The property is set on a beautiful beach and surrounded by lush tropical vegetation. We had view on the gardens and the sea and felt so lucky! Nitiya helped us checking out and also did a fantastic job! I will definitely come back soon! Thank you Pullman Team !"
"2.","Max Beaumont","15","2025-12-11","5","We spent the day at the pool here. We had the entire area and even beach to ourselves, which was lovely. The hotel is located in a private cove with no other developments, making it especially tranquil. So much so that we witnessed a herd of buffalo casually wander across our view of the sea. We both ordered food, and it was all delicious and well priced. The manager on duty, Jaelani, was an absolute joy to be around. He attended to our every need and was engaged with us on a friendly, personal level. Price for the deckchairs is good compared to other resorts nearby, and it’s all credit against food and drink anyway. Though we didn’t stay the night, we wouldn't hesitate to if we ever come back, just based on the high-end experience we had at the pool. Highly recommend Pullman Lombok for a peaceful, uplifting day next to the sea!"
"3.","Metta Ruri","4","2025-12-18","5","I had a lovely stay at Pullman Lombok Merujani Mandalika Beach Resort. As an Platinum member, I was pleasantly surprised with a complimentary upgrade to a Garden Suite with sundeck, which truly elevated the entire experience. The suite was spacious, comfortable, and very private, with a beautiful outdoor sundeck that made it perfect for relaxing and unwinding. The resort itself is stunning—peaceful beachfront, well-designed public areas, and a great pool to enjoy throughout the day. The team was warm and welcoming, as always. Breakfast was enjoyable with a good variety,. I look forward to returning again."
"4.","Johnny Smets","33","2025-12-01","5","Pullman Lombok – a rare blend of tranquillity, quality and genuine human kindness We stayed at Pullman Lombok and from the very first moment it felt like coming home. The hotel is located in a beautifully quiet area, offering exactly the serene atmosphere you hope for when travelling. Everything here just works: the food is delicious, the rooms are stylish, and above all… the staff truly makes the difference. From day one, everyone addressed us by name, always with a sincere smile. You feel seen, remembered, and genuinely welcomed — and that creates a warmth that you don’t find everywhere. But the moment that touched us most came when we had issues with our flight and we had to return to the hotel. We spent nine hours in the lobby, tired and frustrated by the situation. Still, the team remained friendly, understanding and deeply human. When we booked another room that wasn’t ready yet, it took them literally five minutes to arrange a different one so we could settle in right away. No fuss, no excuses — just pure care and kindness. That combination of professional service and almost family-like warmth is rare. And it truly touched us. In short: Pullman Lombok is a place where luxury meets humanity. A hotel you don’t just stay at — you feel held. A genuine recommendation in every sense."
"5.","N C","4","2025-12-01","5","Our stay at Pullman Resort Lombok was nothing short of exceptional. Everything was incredibly well organized, making our experience smooth and relaxing from start to finish. The breakfast buffet was outstanding — impressively large with endless options to choose from. Whether you prefer warm or cold dishes, sweet or savory, there truly is something for everyone. It was one of the best breakfast experiences we’ve ever had. The shuttle bus to Kuta is a fantastic service that adds real convenience to the stay. A special mention goes to our driver, Athar, who was extremely friendly and helpful throughout the ride. His kindness made the trip even more enjoyable. Overall, we highly recommend Pullman Resort Lombok. An unforgettable experience with top-tier service in every aspect."
"6.","Harsimran Kaur Kler Lakbir Singh","6","2025-11-01","5","I had an amazing stay at Pullman Lombok! The room was spacious, clean, and luxurious. Truly a 5-star experience. The breakfast spread was delicious with plenty of great options to choose from. The pool and beach areas were absolutely stunning, perfect for relaxing and enjoying the view. Most importantly, the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful throughout our stay. I would like to give special thanks to Pak Angga, the manager, for his prompt support and kind assistance with some concerns we had. He went above and beyond to ensure everything was perfect, making our stay truly memorable. Highly recommend Pullman Lombok for anyone looking for a relaxing, luxurious, and warm experience!"
"7.","Rashi Banzal","6","2025-12-01","5","We had an absolutely wonderful experience at Pullman. Although we are Accor Premium members, the level of attention and care we received went far beyond any expectation of membership benefits. From the moment we arrived, the team made us feel genuinely welcomed. A special mention to Dela, who went out of her way to ensure we always had delicious and well-prepared vegetarian options. Her thoughtfulness and personalised attention made a huge difference, and we truly appreciate the effort she put into taking care of our food preferences. The service throughout our stay was warm, prompt, and sincere. Every staff member we interacted with was courteous and proactive, and it was clear that they genuinely wanted to make our stay comfortable. Our room was spotless, cozy, and well-maintained, and the overall ambience of the property was calm and inviting. It felt like the perfect blend of comfort and hospitality. Thank you to the entire Pullman team — and especially Dela — for going above and beyond to make our stay so memorable. We would love to return and highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for thoughtful service and a truly pleasant experience."
"8.","Ida Puspita Wijaya","3","2025-12-01","5","I stayed for 2 nights at Pullman Mandalika and absolutely loved it! The whole place feels so peaceful and relaxing with private beach — perfect to unwind. The view, the vibe is spot on. Stayed with a baby and the place is just great! All the staff are very warm and friendly. Shoutout to Mbak Maya at the reception who helped me with check-in. Her helpful attitude made the check-in process smooth and pleasant. Thank you!"
"9.","Katrina Kensington","16","2025-11-01","5","The staff at Pullman Lombok goes above and beyond to ensure you have the best time at their lovely resort. We stayed here for 6 nights and every day joined in on 2-3 activities (they offer 5 a day) for kids. Haris was the absolute BEST! He made our daughter a bracelet off hours as well, and was determined to master the challenging origami day. Our daughter found a friend in him and loved seeing him almost daily. The sunset views are spectacular, the rooms are comfy, the balcony view over the garden also includes ocean views so no matter where you stay here you will love it. The breakfast in the morning will fill you for most of the day, plus the kid's room right there made breakfasts fun for everyone. If you are traveling with a family I would highly suggest you stay here!"
"10.","Ainhoa Bengoetxea","8","2025-10-01","5","We had the most amazing stay at Pullman Hotel Mandalika! The property is stunning, perfectly located near the city and beautiful surfing beaches, with incredible rooms and a gorgeous pool. What truly made our experience unforgettable, though, was the staff. Everyone was so friendly, professional, and attentive—they made us feel completely at home and ensured we were well taken care of at all times. A special thank you to Retam, Jelani, Hizo, and the rest of the team—unfortunately, we don’t remember all the names, but every single staff member was brilliant! We can’t wait to come back and would highly recommend Pullman Mandalika to anyone visiting the area!"
"11.","JASVINJIT SINGH","107","2025-11-01","5","Great hotel with splendid stay experience. We got assisted by Tazkia right from arrival and even checkout. She made the overall process and quick and hassle free one. The stay itself was good as well as the room and the dining options. The pool has a pool bar, the main restaurant is right by the pool. For luxury, this is the best it gets. I will definitely return here again. Hope to see the same friendly faces again!"

"13.","theodore","51","2025-11-01","5","The hotel lobby had a fantastic view of the beach. Thank you so much to Johan for the detailed explanation. I arrived a little early, but my room was ready while I was getting a back massage at the spa. I usually don't get impressed by views, but this place was fantastic. The garden suite was amazing. All the other staff were friendly. The sunset over the beach was beautiful. Breakfast also offered three different types of noodles. If you're looking to try Indonesian food, it's a great option. There's a shuttle service to Kuta Central four times a day, and the tea is always cold and in good condition. The garden suite had a yoga mat, and the living room, bathroom, and bedroom were all separate. The welcome fruit was lovely, and the chocolate was especially delicious. I was so satisfied. I wish I had stayed longer."
"14.","Leena Mooneeram","1","2025-11-01","5","We have had the most peaceful and restful stay at this hotel. So much so that we extended our stay. Without a doubt the best service and support that I've received at any Accor hotel - special thanks to Maya & the amazingly responsive Duty Managers. All the hotel staff are on a mission to provide exceptional service and experience. Zomi, Lina, Willy, Jaelani, Dari, Karim, Tami just to name a few. Good value, beautiful beach location, new gym equipment, excellent massages, great tasting food- we may never leave."

"16.","Andika Pradana Sayogyo","34","2025-12-26","5","Terima kasih untuk pelayanan yang prima selama menginap di Pullman Mandalika. Special mention ke Mas Johan yang menerima kami pada saat check in, dimana kami diberikan penjelasan terkait semua fasilitas hotel. Salah satu yang perlu diperhatikan oleh tamu yang tidak punya kendaraan sendiri adalah, Grab / Gocar / Blue Bird tidak bisa di-order dari Hotel ini. Taxi yang beroperasi hanya Mandalika Travel, dimana biaya 1x jalan dari/ke Kuta adalah 65 rb Rupiah dan ke Bandara 225 rb Rupiah. Order dapat dilakukan dengan menghubungi nomer telepon, dan armada segera datang menjemput < 10 menit. Pihak hotel juga dapat membantu pemesanan taxi tersebut."
"17.","Łukasz Kruszewski","28","2025-12-04","5","Good option for me cause I wanted to go for a techno rave party in Warung Turtle which is nearby. * Good breakfast and good coffee quality. * All service staff so kind and helpful. Excellent job. * Spacious, quite modern room. * Big and comfortable bed. * Beach is near to the hotel. But average one. Saw better ones. All good and can recommend this one in Kuta Lombok :)"
"18.","Alip FXG","131","2025-12-11","3","Kamar (3/5) : kamar sebetulnya bagus dan bisa saya beri nilai 5/5 karena kelengkapan dan kenyamanan, tetapi karena saya waktu menginap di kamar 1122 terjadi beberapa hal yg mengganggu saya (mengingatkan ini adalah Pullman) terpaksa membuat saya hanya memberi nilai hanya 3/5 : - nyamuk. Ya banyak nyamuk di kamar, apalg di korden, saya waktu cek in, masuk kamar, ketika membuka korden itu nyamuknya keluar semua, saya membunuh 20 lebih nyamuk. - kecoa. Ya ini pertama kali saya tidur di hotel bagus di ranjang ada kecoa, ya untungnya saya telp petugas, dan staff datang cepat memgganti sprei dan bed cover nya (nah waktu staff mau menggambil sprei dan bed cover itu pintu kamar dibiarkan terbuka, mngkn ini yg membuat kamar banyak nyamuk masuk ketika staff membersihkan kamar, saya ga tau apakah mngkn sudah kebijakan hotel klo staff bersihkn kamar itu mngkn pintu harus posisi terbuka) - saluran kamar mandi yg mampet, jadi air mandi menggenang, bahkan sampe meluap ke wc, coba kirim petugas untuk di cek saluran pembungan air kamar mandi kamar 1122 demi kenyamanan tamu berikutnya. Layanan (5/5) : petugas ramah, informatif, sigap juga Lokasi (3/5) : tenang, dan mudah dicari menggunakan google map, tapi gara2 ini juga jauh dari keramaian, jd butuh transportasi kalo mau ke pusat keramaian di kuta Jadi dengan berat hati overall saya hanya memberi nilai 3/5 karena saya merasa kurang nyaman (apalagi berurusan dgn kecoa, nyamuk, dan saluran pembuangan air kamar mandi yg mampet) dibanding dengan harga yg saya keluarkan untuk menginap di sini, semoga ke depan hotel ini bisa berbenah lebih baik lagi demi kenyaman tamu2nya"
"19.","christiana ishak","271","2025-12-01","5","The nature provide amazing scenic from the lobby when we had arrived. The clear sky and beach. The atmosphere was very quite because not many people at the hotel. The staffs welcomed us warmly and also the manager. I had a short talk with him who informed me about the tourism in Lombok. The bed room was clean and pretty spacious which have balcony. The breakfast was good and they served us sincerely. It is close to downtown where you can eat at the cafes or you can get your daily needs at the Pepito supermarket. This place is quiter and good for relaxing. The hotel provides jogging activitiy in the morning daily which leaded by the staff. We can go to the beach only take 1 hour."
"20.","ebeckmanns","38","2025-08-01","5","Wow, Pullman Lombok was the best hotel my girlfriend and I stayed at ever. First, the location is just 5 minutes by motorbike from main Kuta town, which provides enough silence and privacy, while also allowing for local life and more impressions of wanted. Furthermore: 1. Staff speaks English very well, greeted and smiled every time they saw us. The atmosphere was positive and we felt like vacation immediately 2. The resort is very modern, clean and well structured. It offers all amenities to feel welcome and just relax, the first time we walked through the entry gates we were stunned by the open concept and sea views. Breakfast was the best we ever experienced with multiple options also for dietary restrictions and good and intense taste 3. Hotel offers free shuttle service multiple times a day, big bonus when comparing to other hotels of this price range, where they ask you to pay extra, throwing me off personally 4. Price / Performance ratio very high. It is a hotel I can fully recommend for families, couples or also single people, we would love to come back one day. Lastly, rooms had all amenities, were modern, spacious and sound proof. Thanks Pullman, you did a great job with this hotel, staff, food and offering, other hotels should look up to you."
"21.","Patrick Tan","9","2025-12-18","5","Have a great stay at Pullman Mandalika. Staffs are helpful, with special experience by Mas Riswanda especially during kids activities time since morning of the day. Other facilities are also great. Overall it’s a nice place to stay for our short break"

"24.","Kartikasari Wulandari","3","2025-11-01","5","An amazing experience at one of the finest hotels in Kuta Lombok! The room was luxurious, spacious, and spotless. You can choose to swim either in the pool or in the ocean — both are right in front of you. The friendly and helpful staff truly made the stay even better. A special shoutout to @Fadhil at reception for always being attentive and ready to assist with anything we needed. Thank you, Pullman Lombok, for such a wonderful stay!"
"25.","Robert Waite","52","2025-10-01","5","OK everyone, listen up, I live in Jakarta where noise is everywhere 24/7. When I arrived at the resort, all I heard all of the time I was there was bird song, beautiful. I stayed here for 6 days, I have stayed at many 5* resorts worldwide and this was one of the most amazing experiences ever. From checking in to and checking out was the most stunning experience. The rooms were excellent value for your money, with all the amenities you could ever need. The resort and the facilities were outstanding, all of the staff were there to make your experience very memorable, and they did it for me tenfold. I went down for breakfast the first morning I was there and I was spoilt for choice, they had everything you could ever imagine, Indo food, western, I was spoilt for choice, very impressed. If you are looking for somewhere to chill, and to enjoy the silence, and to enjoy the simplicity of life and the serenity of loving life, without noise and the complexity of city life, you HAVE to go here, it’s a must for everyone. I visited Bali 30 years ago, and I have to say that Lombok feels like Bali then, silence, no traffic, not may tourists, Heaven for me. Lastly, I would like to mention some amazing people who made my stay here a very memorable experience, Ryan, Melisa and Didik, thanks for your advice and assistance, very much appreciated. I look forward, very much to seeing you and your team again very soon."

The staff were extremely friendly and professional from the start, which made our visit even more enjoyable. The hotel itself is very clean, modern, and has excellent facilities. At the restaurant, both the food and drinks were absolutely delicious. Overall, it was a wonderful experience — we would happily return and maybe stay next time if we ever come back to visit Lombok again."

"31.","Christian Neumayer","41","2025-10-01","4","The resort in general is very good. Great pool and pool bar. Prices are elevated for the region. The room was really nice, but the water from shower went into the toilet. We experienced power cuts in the room during the night. The were only seconds but triggered the room light. When light automatically switches on during the night is not nice for sleeping. First signs of mold in the bathroom. Breakfast was very good. They offer a shuttle to Kuta Lombok Beach."
"32.","Georgie Hurren","6","2025-09-01","5","From the moment we arrived the service by everyone was 10/10. A huge shout out to Willy for his service during our seafood dinner. Another huge mention of Jaelani! He was by far the best worker with the best smile! The rooms were stunning and food was great. This place is a little out the way but easy enough to get a taxi or take the free shuttle into Kuta town. Thank you to all staff for making our stay one to remember!"

"37.","Ashwaq Alamro","4","2025-11-01","5","I can't describe my wonderful stay here. I felt like I was in my home country. I really enjoyed all the details available here, but the most beautiful of all is the hotel staff. No hotel can advance and flourish without good staff. My tongue fails to thank them and their dedication to providing work and the permanent smile. I am afraid that I am doing injustice to any of them because everyone was extremely kind and wonderful, but I would like to thank especially the honorable brothers Agung, Jaelani, Wahy, bawe, satria, reza, syaka. and the wonderful sisters lina,ria,dila,gisell,maey,tamy،Retam Thanks for all of you see you soon"

"42.","Putri R","97","2025-09-01","3","Despite being a five-star establishment, this hotel failed to meet our expectations. The staff displayed unfriendliness and unhelpfulness during our arrival, and we experienced an excessively long wait for our luggage to be brought up. Although I offered to assist in this task, they eventually obliged. The room deviated significantly from the idealized depiction on their website. There were visible holes in the roof, whose purpose remained unclear. The persistent external noise disrupted our sleep, making it challenging to obtain restful nights. The only redeeming quality of this hotel was its picturesque beach view, which was the only aspect worth mentioning."

"49.","Camille Cobb","15","2025-12-01","1","I stayed at Pullman Lombok and was disappointed with the experience. Service was lacking—I had to request room service multiple times and still faced delays. The pillows and towels were not fresh, and even saw four cockroaches in the room during my stay. The beach in front of the hotel was also very disappointing, littered with trash. 😣 With some improvements in cleanliness, service, and beach maintenance, this hotel could be much better."
"50.","Iqbal Noorani","58","2025-11-01","5","Excellent location and par excellence service. The staff is friendly, polite and immaculately efficient. Gigih helped us in many ways to make our stay memorable and convenient. A little more light in the bathroom/entrance would be helpful."

No shop at resort so we rented a scooter to get anything extra we needed."
"55.","Georgia Sibley","4","2025-08-01","5","We stayed at the Pullman in Lombok and it was made into such a special stay from the staffs efforts to go above and beyond for us.

"62.","yanu","14","2025-08-01","4","my first impression , the service esp at reception not helpful… i wasnt allowed to use my upgrade voucher bcause no room available where in fact i check at their website, there are rooms available (one type above my current room). i didnt ask a free upgrade , i just want to upgrade my room using my upgrade voucher as i’m part of accor plus member, unfortunately the reception cannot do anything about it. liitle bit surprise as it is different from my previous experience in another accor group when i used my upgrade voucher even in a high season the drainage in the bathroom is malfunction so there some water overload in the bathroom. i also found hair from previous guest in my bathroom which i havent used it yet. please do check cleanliness the room before being used by next guest the cigarrete smoke from outside at deluxe room (the hotel allow guest to smoke in the balcony) was smelled and big problem for me whom has allergic to smoke. Hope in the future it will be separated, the non smoking and smoking floor to prevent a smoke allergic person of having allergic exacerbation other than this , everything is great , the view, breakfast, amenities, kids activities. The location is very convenient esp if u want to see GP mandalika plus is not too far from the airport. thank you also for birthday surprise for my daughter, we are trully appreciate it i would like to give big appreciation to mrs melissa, mr fadhil, and mr jaelani for their fast response and hard work , to do improvement and meet guest satisfaction."

As Accor members, we truly felt valued and appreciated throughout our entire stay. The team went above and beyond to personalise our experience, our room was beautifully decorated in celebration of our anniversary, which made it all the more special. A heartfelt thank you to Johan at reception, who made our check-in smooth and welcoming. He was incredibly professional, attentive, and kind, always ready to assist with any request, no matter how big or small. His warmth and dedication really set the tone for our stay. We dined at the on-site restaurant almost every day during our 7-night vacation, and the food was consistently delicious. A special shoutout to Zomi and Aaggun, who made each meal feel like a personal experience. Their genuine hospitality, friendliness, and attentive service made us feel truly at home. Overall, we would highly recommend this beautiful resort to anyone visiting Lombok. From the thoughtful touches to the exceptional staff, the Pullman offers an unforgettable experience."

"78.","Abdul Mohamed","9","2025-07-01","5","We stayed at Pullman Lombok Merujani Mandalika Beach Resort for 3 days and 2 nights as part of our honeymoon after visiting Gili Air and it was such a memorable experience. The food was consistently delicious and the staff were genuinely friendly and caring throughout our stay. The hotel’s private beach, complete with security guards, gave us a sense of peace and privacy. One of the highlights was enjoying pizza by the beach over a bonfire on our last night an unforgettable experience, although there was a small accident. The response from the security team and staff was impressively fast. Within minutes, the duty manager came to check on us and reassured us that a 24-hour standby vehicle was available if needed. We were pleasantly surprised the next morning when different staff on shift also checked in on us to make sure we were okay. A special shout-out to Kabul, who made our stay even more special. He was warm and helpful, always checking in on us and sharing thoughtful recommendations from food and new menu items to nearby places to catch the sunset. We’ll definitely recommend Pullman Lombok Mandalika and we’re already looking forward to returning again!"
"79.","Aakruti","3","2025-11-01","5","Service was the sweetest and friendlist. Free shuttles from to central kuta are a great add on as the location is a little secluded . Breakfast was good too!"
"80.","Dewantoro Wibowo (Dewa)","37","2025-07-01","4","Went for a two nights stay with a rather high expectation. It was a low season so occupancy was rather lax, which I personally enjoyed. But for a hotel that’s only two years old many of the facilities and even the rooms; installation, panel and fittings are already off place and a few corroded. Which doesn’t spark a feeling of a luxury hotel. But it is close to the other popular attractions such as the circuit, Kuta beaches, and more. You’ll also find many convenience stores. Making it a lot more accessible compared to our first few days trip to Selong. I personally wouldn’t recommend. But if you’re travelling with family it could be an option. Do look out for off/low season prices when booking otherwise I dare say to recommend similar but places with better beaches in Bali. P.S During our stay where it was low season the staffs were kind enough to let us checkout late. Our son was sleepy and so it was good that he was able to snooze for a few hours saving us from a cranky afternoon. Thank you team. 5 stars service."
"81.","andrew","73","2025-09-01","4","Some great food, also some high prices. Nice location in the area. Beach is ok, not great. Hotel a little sterile compared with Novotel design next door. Good if you can get a reasonable price. Breakfast is very good."

"87.","Charis Howns","29","2025-07-01","5","Originally booked for 2 nights we extended another night as we felt really comfortable here. Pros: - The view is really good with a private beach in front of the pool and lobby. - In the room, bed is super comfortable, they have a pillow menu to choose from depending on your preferences. - They have a speaker, a clock to set up your alarm and where you can charge your phone and a smart tv. - Breakfast buffet is a must try, really rich, with barista made coffee and a lot of choice from healthy to less healthy, to Asian breakfast to Western breakfast. - Activities offered with scheduled always changing. - Free shuttle service from the hotel to Kuta Center. - Spa (can’t speak about as we haven’t tried it) - Good gym, small but with everything you’ll need basically. - The staff always try to accommodate your needs and super welcoming and friendly asking questions about how is your holidays going. - They also have a desk to organise tours and activities outside the resort. Cons: - Staff can be slow sometime but I believe that this is because of Accor’s procedures that they have to follow l. - Location is a bit far from Kuta center and you’ll need transportation but as said previously they offer free shuttle so not a problem because that is price to pay if you want calm. - In the room there is a smell from the toilets or the shower but it’s probably because of the resort being next to the beach. We complained and staff tried to get rid of it with air fresheners but next day smell came back…You get used to it after all. - Room switch’s are really annoying to be honest as the switch for the bathroom is next to the entrance door on the switch’s panel. - There is already some marks of wear and tears for a resort that is that young (2years old when writing this review) is a bit worrying… - Another thing that can be annoying for people is the GP Motorsport circuit located next to the resort which means that you can hear them all day but obviously don’t happen during the night so you’ll have peace to sleep. This is an exhaustive review and hope that answers some of your questions. Overall we had a great stay and will definitely come back if we can and recommend it to you or our friends."

"96.","Ari Setiawan","57","2025-08-01","5","We had an amazing time at the hotel, especially with the kids! The rooms were spacious and comfortable, making it easy for everyone to relax. The service was top-notch, always friendly and attentive to our needs, especially Bu Mel as Manager, Mas Adhi from hospitality, and Mas Jaelani from the restaurant who always helped me. Four days and three nights flew by as we enjoyed the family time and beautiful surroundings. They have a private beach, and in the afternoon they start a bonfire for a marshmallow barbecue for kids; well yeah, I enjoy it too. For hotel location, it's a little bit of a hassle if you have no personal transportation since it's quite far from the central city like Kuta. But they provide a shuttle that can take you to the city. So overall, it was a fantastic experience, and we'd recommend it for anyone looking for a great family getaway. So, you could check out some cool places nearby by Hotel like Merese Cliff, Aan Beach (it's safe for the kids!), and Mawun Beach. Getting there is a bit of a pain since you're driving up and down hills, but the beach is worth it; I recommend it."

It's a great get away to wind down especially if you come out of season ie not July, August or September. Kabul was fantastic - his service and ability personally tailor everything to our likes due to his great memory. A nice change from Bali."
"99.","Aigerim Shamil","1","2025-08-01","5","The hotel is located in a quieter part of the island. Pullman is one of the newer establishments here. The rooms are beautifully decorated and lovely. The kids club is wonderful and activities offered here are fun to do with a 7 year old or as an adult. We enjoyed archery as a family, and myself and my daughter had fun making our own clay art! There are several people from the activities that showed us exceptional hospitality, Indah and Haris are only a few I remember. We have been having dinner almost daily in the Aer restaurant. The staff here are very welcoming and friendly. Most of the staff got to know us almost straight away and have checked on food and drinks! The drinks are really fun and have cool twist on classic cocktails! I personally really enjoyed mojitos and G&T variations:) really helpful staff today Putra, Reza, Agung, Coco, Gisela and Gigih. But certainly there are many more helpful staff in Pullman"

"124.","Drew Stephens","31","2025-12-01","5","I stay here quite often due to business travel, and have always been made to feel like a VIP. The hotel's design and layout prevent it from being a true 5-star resort - there is no Executive Lounge, pool guests walk through dining areas wet, shirtless, in bare feet, etc, and smokers are allowed in the only outdoor eating area. But the management and staff have always elevated the experience to be top-notch.

"136.","Bryan Ho","36","2025-04-01","3","I stayed here for 3 nights in March 2025. Overall it was not bad, but not a 5 star luxury hotel experience. The hot water heater broke on my last night and wasn’t fixed by the time I left the next afternoon, so it was tepid showers after constant rain and wind; the wifi was out in the morning, so I had trouble checking in for my flight; the airport shuttle I had booked the night before was late… The building itself is 3 years old and is generally pleasant but already showing signs of wear - eg sink was cracked and stained, wood laminate on some pillars was peeling off. The service is generally attentive and well intentioned, but can be very slow (Segra seafood restaurant dinner involved a 45 minute wait for food even though there were only 3 guests including myself) and confused (ordered the same cocktail 3 times from the pool bar and only got the correct one on the third go). The beach is relatively clean - except when the herd of buffalo walks across it twice a day and lays a line of dung along it. I had a low season discounted rate so I am still giving it 3 stars, but if I had paid the full rate over high season it would be 2 stars."

"147.","Julian Song","28","2025-01-01","4","We booked the Deluxe Suite for our small family with 2 young children (aged 3&1) as it looked really spacious on the website and had a tent for the kids. There are only 2 of such rooms in the hotel so you might need to book way in advance. Upon arrival, we were very pleased with the room. Everything was new, lots of space for the children to explore, and the welcome platter was a pleasant surprise. We had a largely wonderful stay, and the service staff were very responsive and attentive to our needs. One thing that annoyed us a little was the presence of fruit flies and drain flies in the room. It started with a couple but soon there were tens of them buzzing around the platter and bathroom by the second day. The location is a little outside of walking distance to the main Kuta area and you’d have to arrange for drivers to pick up and drop off. Please note that the free hotel shuttle is a service that needs to be booked in advance. Overall, I think it’s a decent place to stay if you’d like to feel very safe for your family, but for the price, one could easily get a pool villa elsewhere."

Therefore it was the first time in ages that we could finish our dinner and our two children (<4) were playing. The pool and sea view is stunning. People are extremely friendly, especially the bar and restaurant staff. Breakfast amazing - local and western food, very good quality. We had dinner abs lunch also at the hotel and they have a good selection also for vegetarians. Rooms are dated but ok - just make sure you do not get a room next to the lobby as it can get busy during events the hotel caters."
"162.","Melia Suzana","37","2024-01-01","4","The room is pretty clean it just no place to put on your luggage. The view from the room is beautiful. The food is delicious and the price is reasonable. The staff is friendly. The sunset is so beautiful, the beach pretty clean. One think that missing is children playground, they have it but only for small kids, and the swimming pool, if you come with the kids, they will get bored only swimming around, they should put some sliding in the swimming pool. But over all is good"
"163.","zunur osman","7","2025-01-01","5","I stayed at Pullman Lombok in May 2024 for 3 nights. Had an amazing stay, decent size of room with balcony. We received complimentary desserts (its so good!) during arrival as this was our annual honeymoon vacation. The hotel was great, we didnt really go out, we literally spent our time in Kuta the whole time. The lobby and pool has amazing view of the ocean, breezy wind, & we really enjoy hanging out at the hotel area. Staff was really attentive. I mean, all the staff there. They played volleyball with us (staff name Ryan I think), other staff brought us to watch sunset and the bar and cafe staff also were very nice. Good job to the Pullman team. Its our first time in Lombok and you definitely make us want to come back again!"
"164.","nataya naia","15","2025-01-01","5","I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Pullman Mandalika Hotel, and it was an outstanding experience from start to finish. The hotel itself is beautifully designed, with luxurious amenities and stunning views, but it was the exceptional staff that truly made our stay unforgettable. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with warm smiles and top-notch service. Every staff member we encountered was friendly and eager to help, making us feel right at home. A special mention goes to Tawang, who accompanied us on a delightful hike up the hill on our first day. His friendly demeanor, patience, and thorough knowledge of the hotel’s activities and local attractions were impressive. He took the time to explain everything in detail and provided excellent recommendations for places to visit during our stay. The hotel offers a variety of activities that cater to all interests, ensuring there's always something fun and exciting to do. The rooms were spacious, well-appointed, and provided a perfect blend of comfort and luxury. The dining options were equally impressive, with a wide range of delicious dishes to choose from. Overall, our stay at Pullman Mandalika Hotel was nothing short of perfect. The excellent service, beautiful surroundings, and the dedication of staff like Tawang made it a memorable experience. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxurious and hospitable getaway."

All the staff is nice, special thank you to Idin by the pool area, he was very helpful, polite and great worker. Nice beach in front but not much for a use as due to the sand and rocks."
"168.","Calza Fulcher","21","2025-01-01","4","This is the second Pullman I stayed in during my 2 weeks vacation in Indonesia, we booked this hotel in Mandalika because we extended our trip in Lombok last minute. Overall it’s the same good hotel like Pullman Bandung, this one quite more luxurious than the first one in Bandung. Hotel lobby was so grand with direct view of their pools and beach, their complimentary welcome drinks were great. I love their direct access to the beach, sunset here was amazing. Staff are great and friendly. The room size quite big, nice room design too but again the same thing I found with both Pullman Bandung & Mandalika was their details on their construction, i.e: almost falling wall scones, uneven bathroom floor that makes water from showering flood the toilet floor. This hotel only couple years old or so but detailed wear & tear of both Pullman building looks like 10 years old hotel."
"169.","Julia Arungan","2","2025-01-01","5","My son and l really had a lovely time here. We stayed in 15-16 June 2024 to celebrate his birthday. The staffs prepared the room with a cute birthday greeting, followed by some delicious birthday treat. The front desk manager wrote a personal greeting card for the guests. The room is spacious. The bedsheet is the best from all hotels l've ever been, it is soft with a fresh scent. They have thought every little things thoroughly. They even have pillows menu that we can choose, in addition to the lovely pillows provided. I love the fact that they go green as well, by not using much plastics around. Bravo! No grab food available, so we had to order from the hotel. The food is a bit pricey, but worth it. We ordered pizza and club sandwich for dinner, and they were huge and delicious. The breakfast buffet is the best in all five star hotels in Lombok, so many delicious options! Great job to Pullman Mandalika Team, please keep the high standard!"
"170.","Bobby Wibisono Wijaya","102","2025-01-01","3","The staff during breakfast is busy talking to each other, when people enter no offering tea or coffee or water, even when asked they really late on providing what we order, also during the breakfast the empty dishes is not taken away it has been stack for a while until they start to clean the dishes. During second day they clean the room but did not refill the water botol. Overall facility is good. The only point to be improve is the staff service during breakfast and room service. I would like to appreciate one of the chef during dinner, when i mention i have food restriction he offered to grill me some fish that i can accept."
"171.","J (A)","36","2025-01-01","4","It was such a beautiful experience to be staying in this resort. It was new and you could tell by how the buildings looked. The room was spacious, clean, well decorated and the housekeeper kept my room clean almost everyday. The people working there were friendly and always greeted me with a smile. I even took the driver and bartender for a day out to give me a tour around Kuta and the beach. The breakfast choice was broad and I enjoyed the swimming pool. The food during dinner and lunch were okay, a bit on the expensive side. The only downside is the payment process. My creditcards (AMEX & VISA) kept declining and so I the first day was stressful. Although it’s well located, there’s not a lot of choice regarding food from outside. Kuta is a small nearby city that hasn’t been influenced a lot by tourists, which is a good thing but very hard to get a taxi from Grab. When you get transportation from the hotel driver, they will up the price everyday so be careful and ask the receptionist directly for the price. At the end of my trip I was not amused, hence the rating. Overall, beautiful, safe and peaceful place to go alone. Will definitely visit again."

"174.","T Z","45","2025-01-01","2","I recently stayed few nights at the hotel. From what I went through, this is my honest opinion. Positive Aspects: Scenic Views: The hotel offers stunning views of the Indian Ocean and its rolling waves. Pleasant Weather: The area enjoys sunny weather with a cool breeze throughout the day. Inviting Pool: The pool overlooking the ocean is fantastic. Diverse Cuisine: The restaurant serves a balanced mix of cuisine. Finally, great Hospitality from the porters, drivers and housekeepers provided excellent service. Special thanks to Athar for his warmth and helpfulness, and Muhammad for keeping our rooms clean. Now, areas for improvement: Beach Condition: The beach is rocky, smelly, and dirty with cow dung, making it unsuitable for swimming and playing. Beach Vendors: Aggressive hawkers can be off-putting for guests. Providing a designated area within the hotel for local vendors could benefit both the local community and the guests, preventing harassment. Development in the area definitely needs to benefit the local people. Front Desk Service: The front desk needs significant improvement. My booking was initially confused with someone else’s, and despite booking an ocean view executive room with breakfast for all occupants, the hotel insisted I hadn’t paid for one guest’s breakfast although the app through which I made my bookings showed otherwise. This required unnecessary time spent resolving the issue through customer service. Eventually, the hotel waived the breakfast charge, but it was a frustrating experience. Check-In Delays: Despite the hotel not being fully booked, my executive room was only ready at 4 PM, indicating poor room management. Queue Management: There appeared to be preferential treatment at the check-in counters. Despite queuing for some time, I was asked to step aside in favor of another guest who arrived later. Room Maintenance: Although the hotel building is relatively new, the room interiors are already showing signs of wear and tear. Location: The hotel is far from amenities, requiring a driver to reach the nearest convenience shop. While the hotel provides a shuttle service at certain times, it’s not always convenient. Overall, my experience convinced me that the hotel is overrated and seriously needs improvements."

"181.","Rena Schamp","5","2025-01-01","5","Our stay at the Pullman was exceptional! The 2nd floor Garden View King room was clean and comfortable. We could even see the ocean through the trees. The grounds are impeccable and beautiful. The pool was super clean and inviting. There were plenty of sunbeds and umbrellas at the beach and pool. The food was excellent in quality, flavor and portion size at both the Aer restaurant and the Segara seafood restaurant. The breakfast buffet is the best we have ever seen compared to other 5 star resorts. There are Western, Arabic and Asian options. There is amazing artisanal bread, fresh fruit and juice and coffee, tea, cappuccinos etc. Dietary restrictions can be accommodated easily. What truly makes this resort incredible is the people. The staff are all friendly, eager to help, kind and genuine. Special mention to Heri who helped us from Day 1 with any restaurant requests including our need for decaf coffee. He truly knows the meaning of customer service. Puji (her name means praise) deserves praise for her friendly smile, readiness to help and anticipate our needs. Alui and Aria are amazing breakfast cooks and made an incredible omelette on sourdough bread for me. My husband loved the crepes and Gelato made by Karin. She greeted us with a friendly smile each day. Not to be forgotten are Gilang in housekeeping, Retam, Reza, Anggun and Jaelani and so many others that we didn't catch their names. The natural friendliness coupled with excellent staff training was evident. Everyone remembered our names as well as our preferences. There were a couple of very minor maintenance issues that were resolved immediately. The room had toiletries, robes, slippers, safe, kettle, glasses, mugs, towels, tea and instant coffee. There is a mini fridge as well. The balcony was very relaxing. The room is open concept but there are sliding doors to close off the tub and vanity area if desired. The location is beachfront with unique geology. There is a bonfire on the beach nightly. Although it's not a swimming beach, the crashing waves are spectacular and the sand is unique, like mustard grains. There is a shuttle into Kuta several times daily. There is a travel desk with car hire and excursions available as well. We enjoyed our stay immensely and would not hesitate to stay here again in the future."

Shout out to Mas Gawah and the team at the Kids Playground with all the interesting activities to keep the kids active.

The location is quite far from kuta but they do offer a free shuttle.

I kept telling that I wanted to reschedule, and I could not do it from the app. And the service person Devi keeps telling me I must from the app. If English is terrible or logical, have a problem, please, you should not do this job. And i wonder why this hotel hired her. Her service only shows no passion and negative for help. No wonder this hotel quality is more terrible and terrible. Respond for owner. First, I want to reschedule not cancel. From app that I only can cancel not reschedule. App shows if I want to reschedule that I have to call hotel, which is you, this hotel. Also, the app directly connected your phone number. Not service center. I kept telling this Devi that I can't find service center phone number and can't do the reschedule on the app. And she only respond, sorry. We can't help you, you must do it on the app. And my assistant he understood my point and he is wordless. I told him that I give up on it. There are so many 5 star hotel, I have many choice. Period. Oh, your hotel really terrible. Even now, still can't understand my request."

"189.","mike ho","94","2025-01-01","4","This Pullman is fairly new and has great potential due to its location. The staff members are very hard worker and are extremely nice. However, to consider the hotel a 5 star resort is still a stretch, with a strong lack of management oversight and operation processes. Our check in was over two hours of waiting time, breakfast is shotgun approach of claiming any open tables you can (host doesn’t track), and services are mediocre that sorely lacks proper training."
"190.","Siti Adibah","10","2025-01-01","5","Loved the ambiance. Perfect for honeymooners like us. Staffs were very polite and helpful. Plus point for the tote bag provided. I brought them everywhere. Very helpful. Breakfast was exquisite, by far my favourite breakfast spread I've experienced."

Cons: Unfortunately the rooms seemed unfinished, not the cleanest rooms that I have stayed in. Showers smelt damp, I believe there is poor ventilation."

"193.","Dondy Khouw","280","2025-01-01","5","I recently stayed at the Pullman Lombok Mandalika and had a truly pleasant experience. The staff members were exceptional, making my stay truly memorable. A special shoutout goes to Ms. Vony, Ms. Sky, and their team for their outstanding hospitality and dedication to ensuring guests' comfort. From the moment I arrived until the moment I departed, I felt welcomed and well taken care of. The hotel itself was impressive, with well-appointed rooms, stunning views, and a range of amenities to enjoy. Whether relaxing by the pool, indulging in delicious meals at the restaurant, or exploring the beautiful surroundings, every moment was enjoyable. Overall, I highly recommend Pullman Lombok Mandalika for anyone looking for a luxurious and relaxing getaway. The combination of excellent service, beautiful accommodations, and breathtaking scenery makes it the perfect destination for a memorable vacation. Thank you to the staff for making my stay truly exceptional!"
"194.","Agnes","23","2025-01-01","5","Beautiful resort on clean, calm beach. Room was spacious and clean, bed and pillows comfortable. Breakfast had a lot of different Western and Asian options and was delicious (but what's up with the Indonesian female customers sneaking pastries into their purses? I saw it happen on 2 different days lol). We had lunches and dinners with a mix of pizza (surprisingly good, and this is coming from a NYC'er) and Asian food (the Hainan chicken was so good!). Service was friendly and timely. It's about a 10 minute drive to Kuta where all the restaurants are and they offer a car to and back but you should give them at least a 1-hour notice. Pool is big enough for all the guests and there are plenty of chairs and umbrellas. No one seems to hang on the beach during the day so you can have it all to yourself; it was clean. A group of cows with their farmer crossed the beach but they don't linger. Kids playroom has free activities throughout the day with a mix of arts and crafts and donut decorating. Would definitely go back to this hotel if I ever come to Lombok again."
"195.","Marianne Frandsen","2","2024-01-01","5","Really nice hotel with the best service. Highly recommended. My kids loved the breakfast with popcorn, ice cream and sushi.

We had a wonderful stay - thank you."

"197.","Adam Gorczyński","34","2023-01-01","5","Me and my wife are absolutely amazed by this hotel. For the last month we have been travelling through Indonesia, staying in more than 10 places and this is by far the best. One of the problems we encountered in the other hotels, including 5-star, is that the quality of service was often lacking, and the staff, despite general friendliness, was often poorly trained and spoke less than adequate English. But not in here. Here, the level of service surpasses the European standards, and for me was on par with the Raffles hotels. The delicious food provided by the perfectly trained staff, the spacious rooms, the incredibly beautiful surroundings - it all makes us not only want to recommend it to everybody, but also to come back here in a year or two. We were staying in the Executive Room (1414) and it is definitely worth the extra charge - the view is fantastic, and it was great to be able to chill together on the large sunbed on the balcony, looking at the ocean. We can also recommend the transfer services to the airport they offer. All in all - this hotel alone is worth a visit to Lombok."

Rooms are spacious and brand new - the hotel opened 2 years ago. Right on the beach - affordable restaurant menu and great food!

"206.","Heinrich Frankenbach","105","2024-01-01","5","We booked the hotel spontaneously and stayed for three nights in this very new and beautiful Pullman. Jerky and the whole team helped a lot to make this a pleasant stay for the whole family. Our kids loved the kids-club and the activities there. The only down-side was that the schedule for kids and sports activities was not always on time and sometimes changed on very short notice. We also experienced a little issue during dinner, as our starters, main dish and dessert were served at the same time. I guess both issues are rather related to the fact that the hotel just opened recently and the normal procedures and staff still need a bit of training. But I am sure that these issues will be fixed soon to make future stays perfect. In terms of room quality it was definitely the best one compared to a Pullman and Mövenpick on Bali, where we stayed during our vacation too. The hotel is located a bit away from Kuta but still in walking distance. The location is surrounded by building sites as the whole area is under development. Several other hotels and resorts will be built."

"209.","Yasmina R","510","2024-01-01","5","We’ve had a great stay at the Pullman - so good that we decided to extend our stay during the rest of our trip in Lombok and that was thanks to Martha’s great service and help. The rooms are comfy and the food is very good. The pool staff and the staff at the reception, especially Sky and Maya were also very kind and helpful! Overall, you won’t regret staying here and I highly recommend this hotel for your stay in Lombok!"
"210.","S W","50","2025-01-01","4","Overall recommended, had a great time, very enjoyable. Staff is super-nice, friendly and helpful, kind to kids, just wonderful. Rooms are good, cleaning staff do a great job. Our issue was that aircon is not strong enough to cool room. We (adults) had trouble sleeping, kids were sweating heavily. After two nights (and some attempts to fix it), we changed rooms. However, other room was same. Temperature never got below 23-24degrees. Maintenance guy showed us that temp coming out aircon is 18 degrees, so aircon works. Problem is likely that they installed aircon with not enough power to cool whole room. It is blowing full blast all night but temp (by their own wall mounted display and radio on side table) never gets near that. This caused us restless sleep every night and is our only main issue with resort, sorry 4 stars because of that. Internet in resort is slowish (less than 10Mbps), but still good enough to have videocalls with some freezing. Could do with an upgrade. If you use mobile date via phone, speed is over 100Mbps, so for important work calls had to use that and worked fine. Facilities are amazing overall. With kids, the kids club is amazing with lots of activities, all free. Kids play area right in restaurant means we spend using the breakfast buffet while kids were playing, great for both. Gym has everything you need with modern equipment. The massage therapist was amazing, really helped some aches and pains and spent more money there than planned! Location: hotel provides free shuttle to and from Kuta, but honestly the beach in Kuta is disgusting (see photo), beach at hotel is better. Kuta only good for trying a cafe or restaurant, couldn't find any other reason to leave Pullman. Just stay there...see 5 stars for location."
"211.","Leeanne Stevens","5","2024-01-01","4","The facilities and service from the staff were excellent. However the food was average and the package we chose was a set menu for everyday which we were not informed about the food was sometimes 2 hours before we received it and when we ordered room service they forgot one meal. The food was quite often cold. I would not eat there again. The pool water was warm all day long. The drink menu apparently was also on a set menu. Although these were problems the service facilities and location were excellent."
"212.","faraida jilzani","23","2025-11-01","5","way better and less touristy than bali, good for family holiday."
"213.","Silvia Tjang","7","2024-01-01","5","Great view, amenities are well provided including Bluetooth speaker and a wireless charger. Nice kettle suitable for coffee. Some small details needed to adjust such as one of the room's shower drainage gets floody and the bathroom door could not be fully closed. Breakfast varieties are plentiful though need to improve the taste as some tastes a bit bland and lack of aroma. Overall it's a great experience."
"214.","Audrey","26","2025-01-01","4","Clean but some drainage smells in the bathroom Great views from the lobby however the storm took down part of the ceiling which was still not fixed after 5 days The beach is made of artificial sand and not swimmable due to reefs. It is a nice walk to the Seger hills. Restaurant food is surprisingly good. This feels like a top hotel however it lacks a little something eg. there is nothing in the mini bar, no additional soft furnishing, literature, art or high class boutique. The yoga and pilates class leaves much to be desired."
"215.","Imanuel Reinaldo","22","2025-01-01","5","Stayed 3 nights in the executive room with ocean view (not all executive rooms have ocean view fyi, need to confirm first prior arrival) and the experience is magnificent. The room is spacious and very comfortable. The hotel also has a partnership with local travel agency, making it easier to rent car, motorcycle and tours package around Lombok (though quite pricy). The highlight of our holiday here is The Aer Restaurant and the cafe near the pool which served outstanding foods (will be reviewed separately)."
"216.","Sara S","135","2025-01-01","4","Hotel is large and new. There was a big event when we were there. So lots of people and the whole experience was not that of a breach resort. Rooms were very clean, modern and nice. Staff were also welcoming. The beach I think is not swimmable due to the corals. And we felt that the South was a lot hotter. We wanted to rent bikes. The guy checked and said none were available. So it's tricky to get to kuta. Overall an OK stay."

Their attentiveness, professionalism, and warm hospitality enhanced my experience. The culinary offerings were exquisite, reflecting the hotel's commitment to quality. The overall ambiance, coupled with the breathtaking views, made my stay truly memorable. I extend my special thanks to Kabul and Hamdi for going above and beyond to ensure a delightful stay. Highly recommend this hotel for a luxurious and welcoming retreat."
"219.","Michelle Tatang","43","2023-01-01","5","Great place to stay, Super friendly staffs, and they even remembered your name. Very helpful for any requests. The pillows are all very soft and comfortable, great amenities, the room has great view. Foods are superb, high quality and what I like most is their effort on sustainability and environtment friendly by using rice as straw. The gym has the best equipment. The GM, Mr. Vincent was really great and friendly, he made us feel at ease. We had a great stay, and will definitely coming back here."
"220.","Rachel Ilanit","6","2024-01-01","5","I love this resort so much. We spent the most relaxing 2 weeks of our life here. Didn’t even feel like we needed to leave the resort for anything. They have the best food selection on their menu, literally everything is super delicious. The pool area is amazing and the staff is incredibly nice and accommodating. They go above and beyond. This is definitely the place to stay if you’re visiting Lombok."
"221.","Jen Cox","46","2024-01-01","3","We stayed at the hotel for 4 days whilst in Kuta, Lombok: Pros: -Staff are lovely and friendly and will go over and beyond for the guests. -The hotel complex pool and beach are beautiful, the rooms are modern and the restaurant and pool bar are a huge plus. The hotel has deck chairs on the beach with buttons that allow guests to order food and drink from staff at the pool bar. -The hotel complex is peaceful and quiet, it’s somewhere you can relax and unwind. -They have a DJ every night who plays on the deck on top of the pool until 8pm which is really cool! -There is a free shuttle to and from Kuta from the hotel (at 6pm and 9pm) Cons: -Most of the hotel staff didn’t know the difference between vegan and vegetarian, we had ongoing issues when ordering food at the hotel (eggs being served, cheese coming out on pizzas etc). The hotel menu does not show the difference between vegan vs vegetarian dishes and staff are often unsure. The buffet breakfast had very poor options for vegans for the price ($40 pp each day). -You can not get grab, gojek or any other taxi to and from the hotel which is a HUGE pain if you don’t ride a scooter. Staff can order taxis via local drivers but this comes at a massive inflated price which left a bad taste in our mouth as we could see that the prices were a huge rip off compared to taxi prices in Kuta. The hotel charged us $70 for a transfer to the hotel from the port and we saw you could get a transfer at the port for $45. The hotel tried to charge me $45 each way to visit a town one hour away (this was $15 each way from Kuta). We felt like the hotel were cashing in on the fact that there were no other taxi options from the hotel which was disappointing. -The hotel is a 45 minute walk away from Kuta and not near any other restaurants or bars. We thought the hotel should increase their shuttle times to be more accommodating to guests. -All the food and drinks at the hotel are very expensive compared to Kuta. -Some of the hotel planned activities were not running whilst we were there (e bike night tour and volleyball) the hotel didn’t give any reason why this wasn’t running. -Rooms need an extra chair on the balcony. We unfortunately wouldn’t stay again due to the taxi issues and the hotels lack of vegan options and understanding of the vegan diet. With improvements made around increasing the free shuttle times and being a more vegan accessible the hotel would be 10/10!"
"222.","Abhishek Badkul","7","2025-01-01","5","Traveled as a family of four for the first time to Lombok and stayed at Pullman Mandalika. Very modern and comfortable dwellings, absolutely amazing staff who try to make your stay a great experience, good food and beverage options. It is by the beach but while the sunsets were great, the beach itself is not great compared to others in Lombok. It is 10mins drive from the main market of Kuta which had a lot of bars n restaurants. We will absolutely stay here again"
"223.","Jonathan Adams","11","2024-01-01","2","We were disappointed in our stay the Pullman after being very impressed with the lobby and grand decor in our initial viewing. The room we were in was spacious, high tech and had a nice balcony. However, the air conditioner was leaking water onto the floor, and the toilet had issues flushing. The pool area looks nice, but the beachfront is completely empty, with no shade in the form of trees or umbrellas. As a result, there were no guests there during the times we were there. We booked a taxi to the airport through the Pullman Transportation desk. When we went to the desk when our taxi was late, the person at the desk informed us that they had changed the pickup time from 8:30 to 9:30(without telling us)! This would have made us miss our flight. The reason was because there were other (super wealthy Indonesians) guests who were going to the racetrack , and we were being pushed out in favour of them. After making a big deal, the Pullman team resolved the issue, but the fact that they could have made us miss our flight and not honour our pickup was mind boggling. I can't imagine this happening at any other hotel I've stayed at. This hotel gets low marks from us - as it misses on the room issues, and that is more important to us than a new hotel with a grand lobby."

But a great location to explore the beaches, gilis and waterfalls of Lombok in comfort. Great food, we opted for a-la-carte breakfast each day and was not disappointed. We made the trip into Kuta town with the free shuttle, had a lovely time, recommended."
"226.","Meg Celine Cruz","13","2025-01-01","5","My name is Meg. I’ve been to Pullman Lombok twice already (2023 and 2024) for business travel. The rooms are spacious, luxurious and relaxing, perfect to rest after a long day. With all those two times I stayed here I experience high quality service from the staff. There are some noteworthy staff who have gone the extra mile and beyond just to give me a satisfying, convenient and happy experience at the hotel. Specifically the following individuals: Maya and the entire reception staff - who remembered my face from my first stay (one year ago). They are really warm and accommodating. Jaelani and Reza - they are truly professional and keen on providing a luxurious and fine dining experience. I appreciate that they always ensure we enjoy our food, smiling and asking for our feedback and having initiative to reach out to us. Athzar is a truly friendly and smiley staff who greets me all the time and tries to appreciate my culture as well. Vony is a special mention - I encountered a small medical inconvenience and she stepped in to save the day. Last but not the least, Wilda who is quick in responding my room service calls and provides accurate response to my specific instructions. I might have missed some names but OVERALL, I had a really wonderful and relaxing experience at Pullman, I get sad everytime I go home. The staff has initiative and makes sure I am happy all the time. No one was rude too! The staff are WARM and KIND. I wish to come back every year!!! Terima Kasih ❤️"

Will definitely be returning."
"228.","Maria Chandra","23","2025-01-01","3","Stayed here after the transit from Gili. Had an unpleasant experience staying at this hotel. **The Negative:** 1. I am a Gold Accor plus member but did not receive a room upgrade. 2. The Accor staff for check-in and check-out were not available, so I had to wait in the regular line, and the check-in process was very slow. 3. The lobby staff were not friendly, with no greetings or welcoming words. 4. The check-out process was also slow due to several billing errors. 5. I booked 2 rooms for 4 people but only received welcome drinks for 2 people. **The Positive:** 1. The only memorable experience was at the AER restaurant. Mr. HERI was very helpful and friendly. He provided all our requests and needs. The dinner was great and without complaint. 2. The room was very comfortable and clean."

"238.","Genta","1457","2024-01-01","5","Coastal Bliss at Pullman Lombok Mandalika: Seaside Serenity in the Lap of Luxury Embarking on a coastal escapade at the newly built Pullman Lombok Mandalika, I reveled in the tranquility of the Executive Room Balcony, an experience that unfolded at a rate of Rp4,244,680. This beachside haven captivated with its perfect sea view, direct beach access, and impeccably designed rooms. Seaside Retreat: The Executive Room Balcony offered an enchanting panorama of the sea, creating a serene backdrop that defined the essence of coastal living. The private balcony became a personal sanctuary, providing a perfect spot to unwind while soaking in the breathtaking views of the Lombok coast. Direct Beach Access: One of the key highlights was the convenience of direct beach access from the property. The seamless transition from the hotel to the pristine beach allowed for unhindered exploration of the shoreline and immersive experiences by the ocean. Impeccable Room Design: The allure of the stay was further enhanced by the thoughtfully designed room. The interiors reflected a harmonious blend of comfort and sophistication, creating an inviting atmosphere that resonated with the coastal surroundings. Gym and Location Nuances: While the overall experience was exceptional, the gym, albeit functional, presented a more compact space. The smaller size might pose a challenge for those seeking an extensive workout facility. Additionally, the somewhat remote location, though offering a beachside retreat, might be considered a drawback for those prioritizing proximity to the airport. Mandalika Circuit Proximity: A redeeming factor for the remote location was the hotel's proximity to the Mandalika Circuit. For motorsport enthusiasts, this added allure, allowing easy access to the nearby racing circuit and creating a unique dimension to the stay. Culinary Delights: The culinary journey unfolded with a great breakfast spread, featuring Indonesian specialties in the main restaurant. The diverse flavors and culinary craftsmanship added a delightful touch to the morning dining experience. In Conclusion: My stay at Pullman Lombok Mandalika, in the Executive Room Balcony, epitomized coastal bliss and refined seaside living. The perfect sea view, direct beach access, and impeccably designed rooms created a harmonious retreat. While nuances like the gym size and the location's distance from the airport exist, the overall experience affirms Pullman Lombok Mandalika as a coastal gem, offering a serene escape for those seeking seaside serenity."

Food and breakfast are mediocre, not special but it does the job. Tray of food and bottles of juice sometimes are left all empty for long time without refill if we don’t ask to. Most annoying thing is when water in bedroom wasn’t running at all for at least an hour in the morning when we need it most. They said it’s in process of refill, which we don’t understand and no notification at all."

Apart from that, there are lots of activity facilities for guests, so this hotel is very child and family friendly. We also tried archery and were accompanied by a friendly staff named Mas Salman who is very helpful and friendly.

"251.","novia andini","6","2024-01-01","5","Saya merasakan pengalaman yang sangat berkesan selama menginap 4 hari 3 malam di Pullman Mandalika Merujani Mandalika Beach Resort. Pelayanan dari staff FO sangat ramah dan membantu dengan respon yang baik dan cepat jika kita membutuhkan sesuatu, terima kasih Mba Inka dan Pak Erick. Breakfast yang disediakan juga lengkap dengan pilihan menu dan rasanya enak! baik pada saat breakfast disediakan secara buffet ataupun secara ala carte, semua rasa makanan dan minumannya (kopi dan nuice sangat enak) memuaskan, terima kasih untuk pelayanannya semua pelayan di Aer Resto dan juga Mas Satria yang membantu saya pesan makan siang untuk anak saya pada saat sedang berenang di pool. Untuk mencari makan selain yang disediakan oleh resto kita harus jalan ke daerah kuta untuk mecari variasi makanan lain karena belum ada resto yang menjual makanan di gofood. Tapi karena kami juga cocok dengan rasa makanan di pullman hal tersebut tidak terlalu menjadi masalah untuk kami. Anak saya senang sekali menginap di hotel ini, play groundnya bagus dan bersih. Aktivitas untuk anak-anaknya pun sangat banyak, dalam 1 hari bisa ada 2 sampai 3 aktivitas yang dilakukan anak saya dari art class, decorating doughnut & cupcakes, membuat layang-layang, mewarnai, membuat clay dan kegiatan bermain seru di dalam playground, terima kasih untuk Mas towang, Mas Kemal dan Mas Agus dari team recreation. Untuk kamar, kebersihannya sangat terjaga dan fasilitas yang disediakan di dalam kamar sangat lengkap. Secara keseluruhan saya merasakan pengalaman yang luar biasa selama menginap di Pullman Lombok. Thank you untuk staff laundry yang membantu mencuci baju saya dengan baik dan on time! Saran dari saya, mohon perhatikan kebersihan pantai karena sayang sekali masih banyak sampah bungkus makanan yang terbawa ke pinggir pantai, semoga kedepannya bisa dikelola lebih baik :) Thank you Pullman Lombok Merujani Mandalika Beach Resort!"

Padahal pas nanya satpam katanya boleh kok biasanya bawa motor ke atas, tapi kenyataannya engga. Lalu saya juga bawa sopir, sopir ga boleh nunggu kelamaan di lobby.

"267.","Michael Avery","1","2024-01-01","5","We had an absolutely amazing experience at Pullman Mandalika. The hotel was beautiful . We stayed in an executive king room and our children stayed in executive twin. The rooms and hotel were immaculate. I cannot highly recommend this hotel. The service was outstanding in particular in the restaurant. The food was five star and the staff could not do enough for you. We would like to highly recommend a couple members of staff. Heri In the restaurant in particular who was always very helpful and friendly and Agus who was in the pool area . Overall all the staff were so helpful and made our stay really lovely."
"268.","Aysha Antar","11","2024-01-01","5","WOW is the only way to describe this Gem.....from the moment you enter this hotel you will be captivated by the beach horizon in lobby and friendly smiles of staff. I would like to thank all staff for making our stay extra special....every single staff will greet you with a bright smile continuously throughout the day and attend to all your needs. Special thanks to Manager Martha who always checked up on us to make sure our stay was enjoyable and comfortable. Pool man Hamdi who always gave us the best service with a wonderful smile ( we spent majority of our time at pool and Hamdi & staff always took care of us and served most delicious pizza's). Heri special thanks for remembering to bake us almond Danish your gestures have not gone unnoticed and to every single staff member who made our stay a memorable one ...we will definitely be back....ps forgot to mention best buffet breakfast I've had"

"271.","Eric Koh","6","2025-01-01","5","It is a idyllic spot, away from the buzz and crowd, a private enclave to chill by the pool side, enjoy archery. Special mention to poolside staff Jean and Idin, who were extremely friendly and obliging. The hotel restaurant also has a good offering from local to international fare, with a few dishes with great potential, The squid ink pasta with crab is certainly a picture to showcase our Lombok vacation."

"273.","Siman Xie","1","2025-01-01","1","room was not clean, and some of the towels stink. Also, the service at the reception and the restaurant was very slow and unprofessional - staff didnt understand english and it's so hard to communicate. we had our dinner at the mediterranean restaurant and no one helped to pour the wine, however it had a service charge - a total disappointment! wouldn't recommend and will not go back."
"274.","Clairine Wong","4","2025-01-01","5","Our family stayed at the Pullman resort in lombok for 5 nights. We have enjoyed the experience. Our highlight is segara restaurant we had the lobster and the Singaporean crab which was delicious! Dila our waitress was very friendly. She recommended the food for us. We have a beautiful ocean view from our room. We definitely come back and stay in Pullman in lombok again. Thank you ( and Farhan Our housekeeper was really nice to decorate the bed with the birthday wish and yummy cake )"
"275.","mason adams","5","2025-01-01","1","Had a horrible time at the Pullman . Very poor customer service for a 5 star resort , the staff require a lot of training . No welcome drinks on arrival or a smile . Everytime food or drink was ordered an eftpos machine was shoved down our throats before we could even finish our coffee or meal. Booked for 4 nights, and asked on arrival of the first day because it was not refundable if we could atleast have a breakfast included , the manager declined banning higher management . Do not recommend this place to anyone"
"276.","R Prabakaran","334","2025-05-01","4","A very quiet laid back location. Peaceful and uncrowded. The food was tasty and the service excellent. Very friendly place. However no sunset or sunrise views"
"277.","C’HAYA C","19","2025-01-01","5","My family and I recently had an extraordinary stay experience at your hotel that surpassed all expectations. From the moment I entered the lobby, I was looked after by Inka, and she had displayed exceptional hospitality. The room was amazing, we had interconnecting rooms on the ground floor which was very convenience. The amenities, spa and fitness center, added to the overall indulgence. The dining options were a culinary delight, offering a diverse menu with delectable choices. Our favourite was Aer Reataurant, everything was so fresh from the ocean to the plate and the Pizza at Lalo Pool Bar was also amazing!! What truly set this hotel apart was the impeccable service – every staff member went above and beyond to ensure my comfort and satisfaction. I wished I remember all of their names from FO team, HK team and F&B team. Their attention to detail and genuine warmth created a memorable stay. Pullman Lombok Merujani Mandalika Beach Resort exemplifies excellence in every aspect, making it an unforgettable experience for our first visit to Lombok. We will definitely return again in the future."

Its okay. . Sebisa mungkin habiskan waktu dihotel ga akan bosen, karena banyak aktivitas yang bisa dilakukan, mulai berenang di kolam, dipantai, voli pantai .. Banyak deh.. Pokoknya indah pake banget.. Wajib dicobaaa"
"279.","Chen-tin Wang","9","2024-01-01","5","Beautiful hotel and it has everything you need. The staff is very welcoming, friendly, and always in for a chat. The massage from Nining is out of the world. I had many massages before and she is really good and gets the knots out which I did not even know they exists. Definitely come again when I’m here around."

"281.","Cedric Cheung","71","2024-01-01","5","This hotel itself makes us want to come back to Lombok ASAP before prices get to Bali level. Just over a year old, this hotel and all its facilities is practically brand new. Beautiful beach front view and pool (with bar service) to relax. Best part of our stay was the hotel spa, thanks Evi and Nur for the great massages!"
"282.","Amelia Agustina","51","2024-01-01","5","The hotel facilities are like most of other 5* hotels in general, but I think the hotel management should give more trainings to hotel staffs because of lack of hospitality skills. Especially for the front officers. It took quite long to do check in and out. They could learn from their neighbor, Bali in doing so. They needed to be more friendly to all customers. It means not only to foreign customers, but also domestic customers. Nothing to lose to put more smile on their faces rather than appearing emotionless facial expressions (most of them were handsome and pretty, by the way). Visitors need to rent cars or take their own vehicles with since there is no public transportation service (grab, uber, gojek, maxim, and so on) in this area. Our only option to have lunch/dinner was in the hotel restaurant and or by room service. But, as a not beach-lover, we really enjoyed staying at this place and look forward to come back soon. Not to mention the food they served for breakfast and dinner we ordered, they were exceptional. However, please consider to put more lamps or light in the corridors."
"283.","Roeland Trietsch","8","2024-01-01","5","We didn’t stay here, we just dropped in for a drink to watch the sunset. So I can’t rate the rooms. Amazing location, great views and friendly service. We ended up having dinner as well. The food was amazing! A great experience all together. Thanks a lot!"
"284.","Ammer kongtangjitt","14","2024-01-01","5","I spent 2 nights in the hotel. It has private beach with very big outdoor swimming pool. The hotel is very comfortable and peaceful just like what I need. I enjoyed a lot with reading at poolside and the sunset every evening. No other people access to this beach so you get the view for your own. There are many activities in the hotel and most of them are free! I joined ABT class at fitness room. Mr.Taweng was the instructor and he is super nice! The class was active. As 5 start hotel in the Lombok, the price is surprisingly not expensive. Very recommended!"
"285.","Traning Sih","1","2024-01-01","5","Berlibur yg sangat mengesankan bersama keluarga di hotel baru bintang 5 di daerah kute , playground sangat oke untuk aktifitas anak anak . ⁸Breakfast yg memuaskan dengan pilihan makanan yg lengkap dan enak dan di sambut dengan senyuman yg lebar dan ramah dari para staf restaurant.

Sedikit kendala saat pemesanan telur yg sangat ramai tapi pak kabul sudah takecare untuk itu ke kami , karna holiday mengesankan di awali dari sarapan yg mengenyangkan . you next holiday"
"286.","Travedia","10","2024-01-01","4","With great facility, it supposed to be exceptional. Clean, new, (almost) complete facilty. But one downside is really a mood killer. This hotel is so hard to reach! Reservation contact only available during working hours. How about overseas guest with time difference? Even when we checked in already, its hard to reach the housekeeping, since you need to call operator first -which i tried for dozens times from the inhouse phone & cellphone, to no avail. Other than that all is good. Kids facilities were standard, but the hospitality of taweng (?) who took care of our child is exceptional. Food is average. Beach is great. And they let us stay extra 1 hour due tp our flight delay. This gesture means a lot, since it was my child's nap time and it could be a troublesome. Might consider to stay here again if they're improving the contact center though.. :)"
"287.","Chloe Chen","4","2025-01-01","2","My experience with this hotel has been unbearable. Besides being not able to provide sufficient information of an simple inquiry like a airport pickup service in one email, it takes more than a week to give another response for following up questions. I start my inquiry two months ago, and my flight is taking off in less than 24 hrs but I haven’t got any certain answer to their arrangement even though I’ve sent two emails in the past 7 days. Not sure if all this hustles happening due to the price of room or other reasons that keep me from experiencing similar hospitality like others, But will make sure everyone have an update about how everything goes afterwards."
"288.","Mendi Siahandan","12","2024-01-01","4","All good, several comments: 1. The housekeeping keeps slotted in the keycards even though I have pulled out, I ended up having 4 cards at the end of my 2-night stays. As a green building practitioner, I don't appreciate seeing everything on when I come to my room. Just wasting unnecessary energy. 2. My room is at 1402, quite a long walk from parking to my room. 3. All the beverages and food are good."
"289.","Tara Febriani","83","2024-01-01","5","just came here for quick lunch! the food was amazing, they have various taste that not all the hotel have it. every single food taste real, even their sambal kecap is amazing. they serve good cakes also, i had the best tiramisu e'clair ever! this place have such an amazing landscape, near the beach and good arsitecture also. people there are so nice and helpfull. i hope someday i can have opportunity to stay on their room!"
"290.","John Buchner","18","2024-01-01","5","My wife and I have had an amazing time at the Pullman hotel in Lombok. The hotel is very clean and the rooms are extremely comfortable. The best part of our stay has been the staff here - everyone is very friendly, professional and helpful. Special thanks to Zohdi for making our time at the Pullman special! He is a great driver and staff member, and made our stay particularly memorable."
"291.","Jojo Raj","6","2025-01-01","1","Never ever stay here!!! Atrocious service from front desk and manager, bad maintenance, sloppy work, calculative! Room Toiletries not complete when we arrived, toiletries never replenished, front desk only interested to push the Accor card.., roof at lobby fell and still not repaired...I don't even know where to start or end with how horrible everything is! I am still thinking whether I should just move to another hotel even though I have paid in advance.. it is that bad!"
"292.","Epiko08","83","2025-01-01","5","Luxurious hotel with breathtakingly beautiful ocean view and great facilities. This is a hotel where you can stay and spend the entire day relaxing and pampered without doing anywhere.

"293.","Metta Ruri","18","2025-01-01","5","My stay at Pullman Mandalika was exceptional. The room was spacious with stunning views, the facilities were top-notch, and the dining options were exquisite. The staff's hospitality was remarkable. Highly recommend Pullman Mandalika."
"294.","Iskandar","36","2024-01-01","5","1. It is located in Kuta Mandalika, very close to Mandalika Circuit. However, it is quite far from the downtown and other facilities like minimarket and restaurant. 2. Once you stay at this hotel, you can spend the whole day by enjoying their facilities, like beach, acitivity programs, food and drink, and swimming pool. 3. The room is super comfy. Each room is equipped with a bathtub and balcony. You can see the beauty of Lombok Sea and Lombok Hills if staying at the Executive Room 1417. 4. I really enjoyed having breakfast at Aer Restaurant, especially during buffet breakfast. There were a lot of choices and all of them were delicious. However, I expect they can have other options like more dimsum, healthy juices, and egg benedict. 5. There are many kinds of acivities for kids, teens, and even for adults. My kid was so happy with the program and I want to express my special thank for them, Taweng, Jinade, Kemal, and Agus. 6. All staffs are very helpful and responsive. There was a problem with the TV in my room and it tooks forever to repair it. The day after they moved me to another room and it was upgraded to Junior Suite. I really appreciate for their response and wonderful service. 7. Swimming pool is very large. It will be more fun if they provide sliding in the kid pool."
"295.","Cindy Cayadi","40","2024-01-01","5","We stayed at this newly opened Pullman hotel after a few nights at Gili Trawangan. The location is a little bit obscure, away from hustle and bustle. The nearest tourist area is the Kuta beach, which is 20 minutes away on foot. The facilities are not fully operational, i.e the spa and Sgara seafood is not open yet, but you can have the spa in your room. The playground is mediocre. Nonetheless, the food at Aer restaurant is quite exceptional. They make proper pizza, tacos, and pasta. As for the activities, the limited staff makes it seem that they’re under-prepared at most times. We had to remind them that we had made a booking for the kids activities. In the morning, we were guided by the multitalented Pak Agus for our Power Yoga class. He‘s very informational and explained most activities available. He was also the one leading the kids activity that day. Our deluxe room was spacious with bathtub and balcony. It was value for price."
"296.","Umma Mirza","13","2024-01-01","3","Maaf ini baru pertama kali memberikan rating buruk, tapi kami sangat kecewa dg pelayanan di kids Playground, staff terkesan kurang memberikan perhatian pd tamu lokal. Sangat disayangkan hotel berbintang 5 tapi untuk pelayanan masih pilih2 & staf tidak bs menjalankan SOP pelayanan. Sebaiknya jangan menempatkan staf asal2an utk di kids playground, anak kami sampai tidak mau kembali lg kesana krn mendapatkan sikap staf yg kurang baik tsb. Fasilitas dan activity di kids playground jg sangat kurang. Untuk mengikuti aktivitas anak tertentu kita diharuskan reservasi dlu H-1, jadi kurang fleksibel waktunya. Kami menginap 2 malam disini merasa bosan karena hotel minim fasilitas utk anak2. Untuk kembali lg ke sini? Sepertinya berpikir 2x utk fasilitas dan pelayanan yg kami dapatkan. Keluhan lainnya, Ada sedikit bau kurang sedap dr toilet (kebersihan toilet sudah sangat baik, sepertinya berasal dr saluran pembuangan air/ventilasi yg tidak berfungsi dg baik). Kelebihan: Pelayanan security dan frontliner sangat ramah. View dr kamar hotel sangat indah. Proses check in cepat dan kami banyak dibantu. Kebersihan kamar sangat detail. Semoga managemen Pullman ke depannya bs memberikan pelayanan sepenuh hati dan lebih baik lagi. Tampi asih."

The only disappointing is the beach with lots of rock & seaweed, unable to swim. There were some dead fish & sea creatures found on the beach & rock and create bad smell into the lobby during my check in time, suggest to ask your staff to check & clean up the dead fish & others sea creatures every morning"

Jadi pengunjung tidak terlalu ramai tapi hotel tetap menyediakan breakfast dengan pilihan buffet dengan varian menu cukup lengkap dari indonesian food , japannese food , arabian food , healthy food etc . I love the dessert so much ! Fruit and yoghurt aaa i love it . Tapi sayangnya karna kita berkunjung di low season mungkin jd ada jadwal pembersihan kolam renang jadi kita gk bisa nikmatin nya . Fasilitas kamar yg cukup lengkap membuat kami nyaman beristirahat menonton film dengan spesifikasi tv dan audio yg sangat baik. Tingkat kebersihan kamar sangat terjaga . Sekedan saran untuk lebih menjaga kebersihan dan perawatan taman dibagian jogging track sekitar hotel agar lebih nyaman . Thanks pullman lombok ❤️"

The room is big and the two restaurants have the best western and Indonesian food- Agung, the barista made some great coffee. But above all, the hotel staff are amazing and very friendly- My son has the best time in the playground with Tewang and it was nice to chat and understand more about Lombok and its amazing culture. The pool bar serves some amazing coconut and other drinks- and Jelani is a romanista. Highly recommended place and best hotel stuff ever!"
"307.","Keith Goh","23","2023-01-01","5","Excellent stay! Staffs are pretty well trained given the fact that it is a newly opened hotel, speaks good English! A little hiccups during check-in as the staff was too nervous, keep pressing ‘No’ at the credit card machine and cancelled the transactions - quite hilarious!!! Also, familiarity with Accor Plus benefits can be further improved, only on my 2nd day I found out through the lobby lounge menu that there is complimentary drinks for ALL and Accor Plus member. It will be great if check-in staffs can explain this and issue the voucher during check-in. Just a little lack of the soft touch aspect, otherwise is beyond my expectation!"
"308.","Eli Lovci","3","2023-01-01","2","Hotel for conferences/meetings from all Indonesia. Not for tourist that want to relax. Perfect breakfast but long time waiting for coffee, juice (25 minutes).

I’ll definitely be returning and recommend it to friends and family. (I’m actually craving a bowl of Pullman’s Soto Ayam now that I’m back in the States!)

Cons: weird cappuccino. once brought excellent with good foam. twice was like just coffee with hot milk. When leaving, they took the beach bag, said that it was not a gift and should leave it in the room. unpleasant. looked like a compliment with a label."

Rooms are very modern, outstanding with a huge bed and both shower and bathtub start from the deluxe rooms. The executive rooms, in with I was upgraded 🤩 thanks to my platinum plus status of All Accor fidelity program, have a nice view to the see and a big terrace and all the things you need (space, Bose Station, large TV, workdesk, a separate WC, plenty of storage, etc) All the staff are very helpful, warm and welcoming!!! 🙏 They do their best to make your stay wonderful. They noticed it was my birthday and offer me a birthday cake🤩. They can organize for you a private day trip to snorkel in the wonderful Gili Islands (a must to do). The food is absolute delicious from the breakfast to the dinner. I eat the best fresh fish and chips and the best Gnocchi gorgonzola funghi I never eat before. A fish restaurant will also opening soon. Cocktails are also outstanding and very original ! The laundry service is also very convenient and affordable So, this resort is one of my favorite with a very good value for money."

"332.","Nida Irmanti","207","2024-01-01","5","Thank you for the Pullman in Lombok that has given me possibly my best holiday stay so far. We loved their quick service and attention to details through every part of our stay. Woke up well rested every day to the gorgeous view of the hills and manicured lawn before heading downstairs for a long lazy day of lounging by the pool Do note however you cannot call a car using app from the hotel premise but they work with a local taxi company that will bring you into town for 65k (one way), 230k to the airport, or 130k to Tanjung Aan Beach. Another detail is the location near the racing circuit so you can hear the vehicles speeding sometimes all day."

We came to the hotel after climbing Mount Rinjani. We also had the best massage by Nining and Evi. It was one of the best massages we have ever had and was just what we needed after 3 days of hiking. Very relaxing and the pressure was perfectly judged to help relieve the muscles without hurting too much. Highly recommend!"

Didn't expect that it would be that far from centre of lombok tbh, but we were still having a great time here!! Kak Inka & Mas Johan, the GRO & FO was also very nice in ensuring we have a great experience throughout our stay!!! I had such a relaxing time in their spa to, having massaged by Bu Ana and got excellent service by Kak Ningning 🥰 Lastly, I personally enjoy having dinner in Segara, the course meal was deliciouss with enough portion that fit to my preference 💕 Me and my husband truly enjoyed it."

Albeit a little far from popular locations, the spectacular sunset view and hotel facilities made up for it. A sanctuary away from the hustle and bustle! Special shoutout to Gigih who warmly welcomed us during our stay, he shared so many good recommendations on beaches to visit and things to do in Lombok. We are ever so thankful! 🏝️🌅🙏🏽 Another big thank you to Haris and gang for being ever so ready and enthusiastic during all our activities. We had so much fun moulding sea turtles with clay, trying our hands at archery and playing volleyball-turned-football by the beach. We cannot thank them all enough for their hospitality! 🐢🏹🏐 We made so many good memories and will definitely be back 😊✌🏽📝"
"343.","D. Tjendra","198","2023-01-01","3","Lokasi hotel lumayan, belakang hotel ada pantai, tetapi pantai banyak bebatuan yg tajam bahkan ada puing2 bekas keramik yg berbahaya bagi tamu. Balkon kamar kurang bagus posisinya krn langsung bisa dilihat oleh tamu lainnya yg lalu lalang di luar. Makanan breakfast baik, hanya sayangnya di bagian cold cutlery banyak lalat dan ikan mentahnya tidak fresh (amis). Dinnernya ada served udang yang bukan best quality krn daging udangnya hancur. Overall sih cukup bagus, pelayanan ramah dan bersih, hanya bagian kuliner harus lebih diperhatikan."

Lalu product knowledge dri waiters nya harus di training lagi, komunikasi antar pegawai nya di perbaiki lagi, karena sempet beberapa kali di over meja sana meja sini. Lalu pooo bar nya juga kurang siap. 2 kali order, 2 kali ke salip, di tungguin di meja malah gak dateng2😂 Itu aja sih yg harus di perbaiki Terima kasih atas pengalaman seru di akhir tahun 2023🙏🏻🙏🏻"

"360.","Daniel Balchin","19","2024-01-01","5","We had the most amazing time, relaxing, recouperating and enjoying the beach and hotel facilities. Remarkable value even without the Accor All membership. We can't speak more highly than to the warm friendly service and high quality dining options at the Lombok Mandalika Pullman. The fresh caught seafood straight from the sea to the plate in the 5* S'gara restaurant was simply incredible. Cooked infront of you with such personal service, and high quality ingredients. I'll be back for the grilled Lobster, delicate and perfectly cooked fresh from the Sea. Perfect location for a Weekend Getaway, The Moto GP, Conference or longer to explore the untouched beaches of southern Lombok. Fresh, Modern, Clean acommodation and 1st class resort facilities. The number one choice for Lombok I'm sure, we'll definitely be back to our new favorite escape."
"361.","Kylie Heffernan","6","2024-01-01","5","Location is amazing, staff and service are absolutely next level - stand out service from Satria - our pool waiter is the best, Heri - gave a list of incredible places to visit with a undeniable charisma and personality, Huda for cultivating a wonderful team, Lily - who just takes the lead and Hamdi always happy to help…just to mention a few! In saying that every interaction with staff has been amazing, friendly and welcoming. Rooms cleaned perfectly every day. Resort is still new so some things still need to be finished but would highly recommend."
"362.","Kees Verlaan","6","2024-01-01","5","What a great hotel!!! Everything feels luxurious and premium. One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in (and I'm a hotel employee myself so I'm critical) The public spaces, the room, the food (which is really great, especially the Rendang 😋) and most of all: the service... Everybody, from security to porters, waiters and front office: they go above and beyond to make your stay as memorable as possible. Everybody is so kind, friendly, warm, smiling all the time and remembering your name. We really felt welcome and at home. Even allready considering to return for the last days of our holiday after travelling the rest of the island. Thanks to all the staff, Jaelani en Jean in perticular. You guys made our Lombok holiday allready a succes and it has just got started 🙏"

The staff are super friendly and helpful. Breakfast is a la carte or buffet on more busier days which is a good idea to avoid food wastage. The spa wasn't open yet but they recommended their sister Novotel 5mins away. The massages at the Novotel was amazing."
"367.","Egor Sorokin","174","2024-01-01","3","Full honest review) for not 5* hotel, hotel without soul. 1. Booked with Accor app (I though they can upgrade room as Accor member - but never gonna happens, because “fully booked” by reception words, but was available all the day after), so go to agoda it’s cheaper! 2. After long trip with my surfboard and bags, security guys asked me to parking in basement and bring my bags from basement to reception by myself and help of wife)) this is not what u expected in 5* ya? 3. This day we can’t join the beach, because sea was dirty (off course this is not problem of hotel) 4. Guys in restaurant r friendly, but need to teach how to use coffee machine properly :) 5. There is NO minibar or snacks in the room. Food menu I asked to bring to the room also. Room service guy was polite, fruit plate looks cool, other food was average, I ordered no onion, but still onion)) and should be salt & pepper, but was only pepper & pepper. 6. BAD soundproof of balcony doors - so u can hear all the voices and dog barking and wind 🌬️ and every small car and BIG cars and every bird outside all night long. So sleep well - not here for sure. 7. Aircon set up was 23 but always heat to 26. 8. Ahh yes - there is no sauna) btw breakfast was super cool! So if u r lucky, u will enjoy breakfast and maybe more expensive villas have soundproof"

They was extremely helpful and attentive, to the point where I can't recall a single name because everyone consistently delivered a memorable service. While you're there, I highly recommend experiencing the sasak traditional massage for its incredibly relaxing nature. Additionally, I would like to express my gratitude to Mas Erland, our driver, who efficiently transported us to and from Central Kuta for dinner. He was consistently responsive and attentive throughout our journey."
"369.","Severin Hutter","9","2024-01-01","1","The AC in the restaurant drops water direct on you or your food. When you take a shower in your room, the water floates the toilet floor. It was not possible to put the drinks on the hotelpoolbar on our room... i didn't have my credit card with me while swimming so i had do go to the room to get the creditcard. The staff has a false friendliness. I told all those things at the reception. He said to me, that he will tell those things to the director, but he didn't write anything down. It is not a 5 star hotel. I would give this hotel max 3 stars. Will never come again"

Pool nya juga assik dan punya bar pool yang lengkap. Makanan nya juara dengan banyak sekali ragam dan cukup speechless dengan taste nya karena enak-enak semuanya. Petugas Hotel juga sangat responsif dan helpful, 5 Hari saya menginap di Pullman membuat saya ingin selalu balik ke pullman. Thank You Pullman Mandalika"

Hotel berada di area sirkuit mandalika, tepatnya di area parkir sirkuit. Bahkan suara raungan kendaraan saat balapan tersengar dari kamar hotel. Bangunan dan fasilitasnya bagus dan memadai. Akses langsung ke pantai. Menu makanan di restoran juga enak. Fasilitas kamar bagus dan lengkap. Satu kekurangan yang saya alami saat menginap tgl 1 juni 2023, pelayanan dan attitude karyawan perlu ditingkatkan, terutama di area drop off. Masih ada karyawan yang tidak menyapa tamu yg lewat berpapasan dan malah sibuk memainkan HP nya. Bukan seorang karyawan hotel bintang 5 yg seharusnya memiliki hospitality yg excellent."

We have every meal in the hotel, my husband love their Filetto Tartufato which is very delicious beef tenderloin with mushroom and black truffle, my husband says it's the best steak in Lombok. During the 2 days stay, we never leave the hotel. This is a place you can totally relax without any hassle. As an accor diamond member, we have complementary drinks, both drinks we order are good.

"396.","ratna widyaningtyas","33","2024-01-01","2","awal saya memilih pullman karena selain dari deskripsi hotel dan reviewnya lumayan bagus, lokasinya mmg agak jauh dari bandara tetapi memiliki view yg abgus dekat pinggir pantai suasana nyaman dan menyenangkan hotelnya lengkap juga fasilitasnya, pelayanan juga sangat bagus, makan enak oke2 semuanya tapi untuk indonesian fofo terbatas pilihannya tidak variatif trutama untuk ikannya tidak ada hehehehe....kebanyakan makanannya di restoran western dan makanan sehat sayur buah, kelebihan hotel ini dekat sirkuit mandalika yang di gunakan utk race moto GP, hotel pullman menyediakan free shutlle antar jemput untuk ke mandalika dan sekitar kute lombok karena memang disana utk grab atau gojek memang belum ada jadi mungkin kesulitan bagi wisatawan yang tidak membawa kendaraan untuk berkeliling di sana barangkali sekedar mencari makan atau membeli kebutuhan spt pembalut di indomaret itu kita hrs sewa mobil sekitar 65rb sekali jalan dan 65 rb kembali hanya untuk sekedar beli pembalut karena di hotel tidak menyediakan toko kebetuhan seperti itu, saran saja yaa seperti saya yang awam lingkungan disitu dan kebetulan vacation hanya berdua dengan anak hal tersebut menjadi pengalaman tidak menyenangkan selain jauh dari tempat makan tempat kebutuhan barang2 seperti yang ta jelasin di awal (pembalut) itu tidak enak, jatuhnya bosan harus beli makanan di hotel saja. Semuanya bagus sebenarnya hanya saja ketika saya mau chekout ada kejadian tidak menyenangkan yang membuat saya tidak ingin ke pullman lagi yaitu waktu saya mau breakfast sekalian chekout saya menitipkan koper saya ke security yg ternyata shift malam mau pergantian orang, sata tinggal lah ke restauran utk makan dengans ecurity bapak rifai namanya nomor kamar juga sudah dicatat oleh beliau tanpa perasaan apapun saya tinggal untuk breakfast, setelah saya breakfats mau chekout saya melihat di dekat security berdiri ko tidak kelihatan koper saya persaan saya tidak enak, ketika saya tanyakan ke securitynya tidak tau dan kebetulan sudah ganti shift, saya minta segra dikonfirmasikan ke security yang sebelum bapak yg duty yg saya tania perihal koper saya ko tidak ada dan ternyata securitynya tidak bisa dihubungi pak rifai itu sampai pada akhirnya saya minta cek cctv dan ternyata terbawa pengunjung hotel yg lain??KOK BISA???seharusnya kalau bukan pemiliknya yg ambil tidak dikasihkan tapi petugas hotel bilang pengunjung yang ambil satpamnya tidak tahu laah ko bisa tidak tahu???wong dititipin ko bisa bekerja selalai itu???padahal saya harus ke bandara alhamdulillahnya penerbangan saya itu siangan laah klo saya mepet ke bandara harus menunggu koper saya balik tiket saya hangus siapa yang mau tanggung jawab ganti tiket saya??tolong yaa barangkali dipertimbangkan lagi dalam mempekerjakan pegawainya karena disana staf sebagian sangat ramah ada juga yang biasa saja malah terkesan ada yang diajak bicara salah satu dari mereka terkait komplain saya kehilangan koper kelihatan nada tinggi dalam melayani komplain, saya masih sabar ndak marah2 tp saya kecewa dengan hotel pullman dalam pelayanannya"
"397.","X W Chan","33","2024-01-01","5","@Kemal and @Nining were extremely accomodating and hospitable during my short stay with Pullman Lombok. The facade of the resort is beautifully designed but the rooms are starting to show signs of age despite the young age. There’s mould along the angle between the wall and the sink, which is quite irksome as it is right in my face whenever I brush/wash up. Hope the building keeps up the hospitality and a little of anti-mould would probably help!"
"398.","Mangan Dolan","376","2024-01-01","4","Hotel ini terletak sebelahan sama mandalika circuit. Lumayan Jauh dari kota Kuta dan sebelahnya tidak ada minimart atau restaurant. Jadi kalau kalian kesini pilihan makan hanya dari room service. Tidak ada gofood or grabfood dsb. Pas kesini pantai lg surut jadi ga bs main dipantai Jadi cuma bs berenang aja di pool akhirnya"
"399.","William Go","331","2024-01-01","5","New resort with private beach in Lombok, very close to Mandalika circuit. The swimming pool is very huge and a lot of sun loungers in the pool side as well as beach. The executive room was clean, spacious, and comfortable. It has big balcony where I can just sit, relax, and enjoy the sea breeze for hours. Breakfast has no many options as compared to other 5 stars resorts, but they served delicious nasi balap puyung (Lombok’s signature mixed rice). Staffs were friendly, including Mr. Taweng and Agus from kids club. And Mr. Eric, FO Manager, greeted us during check in and check out. Will surely come back again when I visit Lombok."

This Pullman Lombok stood out for its impeccable services and big smiles. I want to thank Nining and Evi for my 3 continuous days of 2.5 hour incredible massage, Valdo for above and beyond service at Aer restaurant, and Robi and Maya for their incredible hospitality at the reception. We did not step out of the hotel for 4 days. Highly recommend to anyone who just wants to chill by the pool at the resort and enjoy great food and amazing weather!"

"410.","Tia","4","2024-01-01","2","Reservasi kacau, seperti bukan di hotel bintang 5. Details di reservasi asal, nomor hp sampai bisa salah padahal pesan lewat aplikasi besar yang trusted. Sampai ke hotel dibilang tidak ada reservasi padahal sudah dibayar. Dan pihak hotel malah menyalahkan pihak lain lagi. Kacau tidak seperti hotel accor management yang lain. Tolong di evaluasi kenapa reservasi nya bisa berantakan seperti ini."
"411.","Alicia Hock","316","2024-01-01","4","We stayed 2 nights at this resort. There are no shops or restaurants close to the resort. Bluebird app work in Mataram and Seggigi but not in this area. The resort called a taxi for us to go to Kuta Beach main street for 65K IDR, the trip took about 10 mins. Later during the day we discovered that we can walk back to the resort along an unpaved foot path that was shown in Google map. This walk took about 20 mins from Kuta beach to the beach in front of Pullman resort. There is a faster way on the sand that is possible during low tide, but it is very rocky and we didn't think it is safe. The beach in front of Pullman resort is clean, but very rocky during low tide. It's actually public beach and there are local kids playing during low tide. Room is spacious, clean and quiet. Food at the restaurant is good."

Dan untuk bagian outdoor ny terlalu panas dan kering, tidak ada pohon rindang yg bikin teduh, jarak parkiran mobil ke loby pun juga jauh dan ga ada jalan setapak nya, hujan kehujanan panas kepanasan :("
"429.","Christian Barrington","8","2023-01-01","5","Come for the view, stay for the food! For a hotel in its infancy, opening just one day before my arrival, I was quietly nervous that it could be a little - how shall we say, chaotic? Oh what a steady ship I found, not quite finished, but what strong bones it has. The view is spectacular as is the beach and the pool, the rooms beautifully appointed and blissfully quiet, but the real surprise here is the cucina, led by Gianluca Visciglia. The breadth of knowledge and masterful execution of a truely international menu really shines through here. I can honestly say this is the first time I have stayed within a resort for 21 meals in a week, I just couldn’t find a reason to leave. The warmth of every one of the staff, lead by the inimitable Vincent, was just pure joy. Thank you to every one of you! Just pack you bags and go……"
