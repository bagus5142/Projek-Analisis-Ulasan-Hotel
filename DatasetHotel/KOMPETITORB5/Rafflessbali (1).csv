"1.","Tariq Alhammadi","265","2025-12-01","5","From the moment we arrived, Raffles Bali completely exceeded every expectation. The staff welcomed us with such genuine warmth — everyone we met went above and beyond to make our stay unforgettable. Our personal butler was incredibly attentive without ever feeling intrusive, always one step ahead in anticipating what we might need. Every smile felt sincere, and the level of service here truly sets Raffles apart. Our villa was absolutely stunning — spacious, peaceful, and beautifully designed with a private infinity pool overlooking the ocean. The attention to detail was extraordinary, from the fresh tropical flowers to the nightly turndown treats. Waking up to the sound of birds and waves every morning felt like a dream."
"2.","Alexandr Kim","12","2025-11-01","5","I recently had the pleasure of staying at Raffles Bali, and it was an unforgettable experience from start to finish. The property is absolutely stunning — serene, private, and surrounded by lush nature with breathtaking views of the ocean. Every corner of the resort radiates peace and luxury. The villa itself was immaculate and beautifully designed, offering complete privacy and comfort. The private pool and outdoor spaces created the perfect environment to unwind and enjoy the tranquility of Bali. Dining was another highlight — delicious food with fresh ingredients, a great variety of dishes, and outstanding presentation. The cliffside dining experience was particularly magical. Highly recommended."
"3.","Amy Shi","95","2025-11-01","5","We appreciated that this Raffles is quite new, with all the comforts and thoughtful features that come with a modern resort. The villas are beautifully landscaped, with serene front gardens and lovely backyards featuring an infinity pool overlooking the ocean. Sitting in the pavilion, surrounded by nature, was simply exquisite. We especially loved the breakfast and lunch selections — fresh, varied, and beautifully presented. Dinner, however, was a bit challenging due to mosquitoes. Another drawback was the nearby construction of a high-rise building, which somewhat disrupted the otherwise tranquil atmosphere. The service at Raffles is outstanding, as expected from the brand. They offer complimentary limo services from and to airport. The staff and management team are all super friendly and helpful. The highlights of our stay were the spa and the resort photographer. The massage at the spa was truly the best I’ve ever had, and the photo session was exceptional — the photographer was incredibly talented. We ended up purchasing a beautiful, high-quality photo album and received all the digital files as well. Highly recommend doing this experience while you’re there."
"4.","Tiffany Thornton","72","2025-12-01","5","I had the most wonderful calming spa experience at the Raffles Bali spa. It started with a Balinese massage that was so relaxing. Then I had the opportunity to go inside the cave for a chakra and reiki session. It was so soothing, and the energy in the cave was very peaceful. I could have lingered there all day. Make sure to book time at the spa you won't be disappointed."

From the moment we arrived, we were immersed in a world of tranquility, beauty, and impeccable service. The villa was absolutely stunning — spacious, serene, and surrounded by lush, beautifully maintained landscaping that created a true sense of paradise. Every detail was thoughtfully designed to provide both comfort and elegance. Dining at Raffles was an exceptional experience in itself. From breakfast to dinner, every meal felt like fine dining — beautifully presented and bursting with flavor. The culinary team clearly takes great pride in their craft. Our anniversary dinner at the Secret Cave in Raffles Bali was an unforgettable, once-in-a-lifetime experience. The setting was absolutely magical — the cave beautifully illuminated and decorated with such attention to detail, creating the most romantic atmosphere imaginable. Each course was not only delicious but also a true work of art — a perfect blend of creativity, flavor, and presentation. It felt like dining inside a dream. Our waitress Ann, was exceptional — warm, attentive, and genuinely caring, making the entire evening even more special. Raffles turned our celebration into a memory we will cherish forever. Truly a masterpiece of fine dining and romance in every sense. What truly made our stay unforgettable was the team. The entire staff, from the hotel manager, Bernadine to the room attendants, restaurant servers, spa staff, and especially our dedicated butler, Aditya were genuinely kind, professional, and attentive. Their warmth and personalized care made us feel incredibly welcome and special throughout our stay. Raffles Bali delivers a level of service and attention to detail that is rare and remarkable.

From the stunning villas with ocean views to the incredible facilities, every detail was flawless, from our exceptional butler Endah who cared so deeply for us, the breakfast food and service was something spectacular.

"9.","Mohammed AlAli","13","2025-09-01","5","We had the most wonderful honeymoon at Raffles Bali Resort, and every moment from arrival to departure was truly exceptional. The resort’s personalized service made our stay unforgettable, and our dedicated Butler, Bella, went above and beyond to ensure that all our requests were fulfilled seamlessly, often exceeding our expectations. The resort itself is breathtaking, with world-class facilities and activities that made our time both relaxing and enriching. We especially loved the botanical tour through the resort’s enchanting gardens, which was both peaceful and fascinating. Another highlight was the private BBQ by the beach, an intimate and beautifully arranged experience that made our honeymoon extra special. Raffles Bali delivers luxury at its finest, blending impeccable service with unique experiences. We highly recommend it to anyone seeking a romantic and memorable escape — and we would definitely stay here again."

"11.","140 Milionów","1","2025-09-01","5","Raffles Bali is more than just a hotel – it’s a complete experience of luxury, serenity, and genuine care for the guest. From the moment of transfer to the farewell, we felt truly special. Our private butler Yudi responded instantly and fulfilled every request – he even played tennis with us! The villa with a private pool, jungle view, and the Indian Ocean was flawless. The massage at Rituals of Spa was one of the best we’ve ever had. The food was delicious and perfectly tailored to our dietary needs. The service at Raffles is exceptional – rare kindness, discretion, and attentiveness at every step. We’ve stayed at many luxury hotels, but this one outshined them all – by far. Silence, nature, elegance – if you’re looking for a place to reset in true premium standard, there’s no better address. We want to come back."
"12.","joseph lee","3","2025-10-01","5","Fantastic beach resort that ticks all the boxes, but it’s the people of Raffles Bali - every single one of them - that makes it shine. The villa is perfect: private villa nested on a lush landscape atop a small hill overlooking Jimbaran Bay. Room was well furnished, designed to the finest detail (eg. you don’t notice the air con unit within the Balinese styled architecture, local art pieces adorned the room, including a full headboard crafted in Balinese motif prints, all the colours used in the architecture and interior design pieces are complimented and thought out), and had everything we needed for comfort and luxury. You never notice or hear the other residents in and around the resort except for mealtimes - it truly feels exquisite. Food was incredible, every meal is a satisfying, delicious adventure into local Balinese cuisine. Rumari, with Mr G and his team of knowledgable, accommodating and warm staff, was a gastronomical and cultural experience not to be missed. The meals there were among the best we have had in Bali. It’s amazing how every staff member in Raffles knows you by your names, remembers previous conversations and your preferences. Every staff we met is kind, warm and engaging, shows pride of their respective roles in the resort, and are always happy to take time to share their knowledge on Balinese culture, food, environment and local practices. A simple conversation on our favourite Balinese dish, and behold, they ask if they can prepare it for the next day’s meal (which they do, with great aplomb and utmost sincerity). Exemplary. We left the resort after 3 days, refreshed and recharged from the environment, the food, and most of all, from the genuine interactions with the wonderful people at Raffles."
"13.","Maja Keler","1","2025-10-01","5","We stayed at Raffles in august as our last stop in Bali. The Presidenial Villa is huge, with big pool and a great view. Location is great, service as well, Sanctuary is a great place for relaxing and restaurants are good. We did some romantic dinners in Cave, Private Gazebo, In villa BBQ, each one better than the other. Shoutout to our batler Krishna who made our stay smooth and worry less!"
"14.","Lucy Dem","19","2025-10-01","5","Another extraordinary stay at Raffles. Luxurious villas, beautiful views and great food (courtesy of Chef Gaetan Biesuz and also the team at Loloan Beach Bar & Grill). Our butlers - Seva and Bella - went above and beyond, despite the short stay made it truly unforgettable. Although there is no kids club, they do have a number of activities (think cookies decorating, pizza making and arts & crafts etc) that are of a very high standard and kept the children thoroughly entertained. Highly recommend!"
"15.","Danielle Van de Velde","6","2025-10-01","5","Thank you for a wonderful few days. The villa, service, dining and spa were all top notch. Every staff member was a delight to interact with."
"16.","Anusha Ullagaddi","70","2025-06-01","5","Resort Review: A Truly Royal Experience at Raffles Bali Our recent stay at Raffles Bali was nothing short of magical. Every detail, from the breathtaking location to the impeccable service, made our experience unforgettable. Here’s a breakdown of the highlights: Nestled along a serene bay, the resort offers stunning ocean views and mesmerizing sunsets that create the perfect backdrop for relaxation. The property is lush and beautifully maintained, with greenery all around and charming buggy paths that make moving around the resort both fun and scenic. We stayed in a pool villa, and it was pure luxury. The villa was super clean, extremely well-appointed, and came with a generously stocked bar and snack selection. The private pool added a special touch of indulgence, making it an ideal space to unwind in total privacy and comfort. Staff and Service : This is where Raffles truly stands apart. The staff were phenomenal—they remembered each guest’s name and food preferences, which made us feel incredibly valued and cared for. Special mention to our personal butler, Seva, who went above and beyond to make us feel like royalty throughout our stay. From the warm welcome to the smooth checkout, every moment was handled with grace and attention to detail. The cookie decoration class for kids was a thoughtful touch—our child loved it, especially the colorful decorations and the adorable turtle toys. The poolside fine-dining experience was also spectacular, offering a romantic and beautifully set ambiance The culinary offerings were excellent with plenty of delicious options. Among the highlights for us were the Vegetarian Primavera, Avocado Toast, and Chia Pudding—each dish was fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. Overall Experience From start to finish, Raffles Bali delivered a world-class experience. The luxurious comfort, exceptional service, and family-friendly touches made our stay unforgettable. We missed the place as soon as we checked out, especially the luxurious Raffles car that took us on our final journey. A very special thanks for the room upgrade. That was a total game changer. We will definitely return, and highly recommend this resort to anyone looking for an indulgent escape in paradise."
"17.","Long Nguyen","32","2025-09-01","5","Beautiful estate, so nice and welcoming staff, an excellent gastronomic restaurant and activities which leave you with unforgettable souvenirs. That’s how I would describe my lovely stay at the Raffles Bali."
"18.","Jess Stanley","6","2025-07-01","5","Great stay. Amazing service from Thomas. My family and I stayed for a couple days & had the best time as Thomas was able to give us various recommendations for activities and in-hotel services. Food was excellent at Loloan restaurant as well."
"19.","Hyein Seo","1","2025-07-01","5","We had an absolutely amazing stay at Raffles Bali. Our butler, Sila, was incredibly kind and attentive—he made sure every little detail was perfect, and we felt truly cared for the entire time. The food at both Rumari and Loloan was exceptional, and the massage was honestly the best we’ve ever had—on a whole different level in both technique and service. Everything from the beautiful scent throughout the resort to the breathtaking views and the warm, genuine hospitality of every staff member made our stay unforgettable. We’re already looking forward to coming back for our next holiday."
"20.","Klaudia48626","8","2025-03-01","5","I have never experienced such exceptional service at any hotel before. The location of the hotel is excellent, the facility is very clean, well-maintained, and beautifully designed. The butler service is outstanding, making every wish come true.

"21.","Alain Graf","30","2025-06-01","5","Raffles Bali exceeds everything by far! Every detail is perfect and the atmosphere is outstanding. The staff is really incredible and every single one is so friendly and professional. Huge respect and appreciation for all the unforgettable moments you have given to us. Our 470sqm villa with private pool and ocean views was spectacular. Butler available via WhatsApp - incredible service! The food & beverage in all restaurants are world-class. Peaceful location on 23 hectares, only 20 min from airport. Spa excellent, infinity pool amazing. We definitely will coming back 🥰 Matur Suksma 🙏🏻"
"22.","Avneesh Kaicker","340","2025-04-01","5","Absolute top tier property makes for a superb experience, somehow made even better by the incredibly high standard of service set by the staff. This is a villa-only property, so expect a very large, spacious and luxurious living space. Everything is high quality, from the bed linen to the towels and toiletries. Every villa has a large pool, a large cabana, and lounge chairs. Some villas have a panoramic view of the ocean. There is a real commitment to the environment here - there seems to be no plastic anywhere on the property!"
"23.","Peter Ulbert","8","2025-08-01","5","Raffles Bali is truly incredible. The villas are elegant and so thoughtfully designed. The food from Loloan is terrific, and the breakfast at Rumari has great western and Indonesian options. We had a massage and participated in a Reiki ceremony, both excellent and highly recommended. What stands out, though, is the service. Staff here really go out of the way to make your stay special. One example that stands out is my wife had a stomach bug upon arriving. The staff knew this, and not only did they check in to see how she was doing, our butler thoughtfully brought eucalyptus oil to our villa as a gift to make her feel better. We will definitely be returning!"
"24.","Ross Keeling","21","2025-05-01","5","Our family had the most incredible experience at Raffles Bali. From the moment we arrived, the service was flawless, warm, attentive, and truly personal. Special thanks to Aditya, our wonderful butler, whose care made our stay seamless, and to Bernadine, the Hotel Manager, whose thoughtful leadership was evident in every detail. Our villa was immaculate and luxurious, with the lavender pillow being an unexpected highlight—so relaxing! Every moment felt curated for comfort and calm. A huge thanks to the entire Raffles Bali team for a truly unforgettable stay. We can't wait to return!"
"25.","Anand Immannavar","45","2025-06-01","5","Our recent two-night family escape to Raffles Bali was simply extraordinary, truly marking it as one of our most cherished travel experiences. Our stay was elevated by an incredible upgrade to the Presidential Suite. This expansive and luxurious haven provided ample space for our family to unwind and truly feel pampered. A highlight that stands out was the in-villa barbeque experience. Imagine a private chef preparing a delectable feast right in the comfort of your own villa – it was a culinary dream come true and an unforgettable family bonding moment. The service was impeccable, thanks to our exceptional butler, Seva. He was incredibly attentive and anticipated our every need, making our stay seamless and truly relaxing. And the journey began in style with the BMW X7 pickup; it's a detail not to be missed and sets a magnificent tone for your visit. Our children were thoroughly entertained, spending hours splashing in the beautiful pool. They also adored the engaging activities like cookie decorating and various pool games, which kept them happily occupied. Raffles Bali delivered an unparalleled luxury family retreat. We left feeling refreshed, indulged, and already longing to return."
"26.","Claudio Bardi","11","2025-02-01","5","I recently had the privilege of staying two nights at Raffles Bali, an intimate yet spacious beach resort adjacent to the renowned Jimbaran Bay. Calm and peaceful, with welcoming staff and personalized service, from start to finish the stay was luxuriously understated and excellent. Check in was a breeze, buggy service was quick and in-room dining was delicious and well presented. The facilities, while compact (the reception/lobby/lobby bar/restaurant sits on top of the spa), the beachside pool and restaurant was a destination unto itself. The villa itself was spacious but minimalist (in a traditional Balinese way) with the focus entirely on the view beyond the infinity pool towards the spectacular ocean. Looking forward to my next visit!"

"28.","Steven Hanbit Kim","5","2025-03-01","5","From the moment I stepped into Raffles Bali, I knew I was in for something extraordinary. This resort isn’t just a destination—it’s a masterclass in luxury, privacy, and impeccable service. Every detail, from the breathtaking design of the villas to the serene poolscapes nestled within lush tropical gardens, felt like a personal invitation to unwind in paradise. Our villa was a sanctuary of elegance, blending traditional Balinese charm with modern sophistication. The private pool became our morning ritual spot, while the outdoor terrace, surrounded by fragrant frangipani blossoms, offered a dreamy escape. The staff deserves a standing ovation: warm, attentive, and genuinely passionate about creating unforgettable moments. Whether it was our butler’s thoughtful surprises or the cocktail artisan at the bar crafting bespoke drinks, their dedication elevated the experience to pure magic. Don’t Miss Tips: 1️⃣ Cave Dining at The Secret Cave: A once-in-a-lifetime culinary journey! The flickering torches, ocean whispers, and gourmet dishes create an otherworldly ambiance. Book weeks in advance—this gem is worth the planning. 2️⃣ Splurge on a Pool Villa: The indulgence of waking up to a private dip surrounded by tropical serenity is unmatched.

"29.","Éva Simon","1","2025-05-01","5","Raffles Bali is a hidden gem — breathtaking, private, and deeply personal. What made it truly unforgettable was the incredible team, especially our butler, Seva, who made every moment perfect. During a medical emergency, their care and support were beyond anything we could have hoped for. Raffles Bali isn’t just a resort — it’s a place with true heart. We can’t wait to return."
"30.","Eric Pulver","29","2025-01-01","5","Our enchantingly memorable stay at Raffles Bali was a top-notch experience from start to finish. We stayed four nights at the beginning of December, 2024 as part of our wedding anniversary celebration. The spectacular location of this luxury hotel is in Jimbaran on the Indian Ocean, only a short drive from the Denpasar airport. Built along a steep incline, the resort’s villas can be accessed by stairs or winding paths, but we preferred the employee-driven buggies to move around the property. The well manicured landscaping accentuated the overall “posh but laid back” vibe of the resort. Our Private Villa was phenomenally appointed with all the amenities one would expect from a luxury resort. The private pool and the huge, landscaped courtyard was a wonderful place for us to relax, take in the views, and enjoy each others’ company. The butler service (provided by Gaby and crew) was exceptional and left us wanting for nothing. The most impressive part of our stay with Raffles Bali was the staff. These people were so very friendly and helpful in every possible way. Simple touches like addressing us by our names and remembering our preferences made us feel pampered and appreciated. We highly recommend this to other travelers and plan on a return trip in the very near future."
"31.","Oliver Broich","18","2025-03-01","5","We had the absolute perfect time at Raffles Bali. From the moment we landed at Bali airport we were taken care off and everything was organised to perfection. The first Raffles team member picked us up immediately after immigration and helped with our luggage even before customs. Arriving at the hotel was a wonderful experience with a beautiful ceremony and a truly heartfelt welcome from the entire team. Every wish or request we had during our stay was arranged and managed super fast by either the butler or other team members. Our villa was in an absolute amazing state and the view from our Infiniti pool was just beautiful. Overall all amenities at the hotel such as the pools or tennis / pickle ball courts were in perfect shape. The restaurants and bars at the resorts offer fantastic food and the service by everyone was just outstanding. The food selections were brilliant with an unbelievable combination of local produce, influence of local traditions and international high quality ingredients. Simply brilliant menu creations by culinary Director Gaetan Biesuz. Everyone was so super friendly, helpful and accomodating throughout our entire stay. The entire staff made it a truly amazing holiday to us. Best Bali experience ever and we’ll definitely return for our next trip to Bali."

"33.","MD","13","2025-05-01","5","Sadly, we just checked out of Raffles Bali, after an 8 day stay. I hope my review, will influence people to stay at Raffles Bali. We felt like we were leaving family. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with beautiful smiles, with such authentic thoughtfulness and generosity, throughout our stay. They know what you need, before you need it. The ambiance, is quiet understated relaxed luxury, tranquil and peaceful. Personal Butler, takes care of all your needs. It is the best personalized service we have ever experienced. Room: Hill top villa with a spectacular view of the ocean. The bed was so comfy. The linens were high quality. Choosing the type of pillow, added to a perfect nights sleep. Touches such as automatic drapes, evening tea and snack left in the room each night at turn down service, basket of fresh fruit every day, added another layer of pampering. We were pleased with the level of privacy. Food: We are seasoned travellers and foodies. All our meals both at Rumari and Loloan were amazing. The high quality ingredients are 80 percent locally sourced. Each dish looks visually beautiful, and a myriad of flavours unravel in your mouth, with every bite. Clearly, each menu has been well thought out, and emphasizes the incredible talent of Chef Gaetan and his team. Undoubtedly, this is Michelin star quality. With respect to Rumari: Each meal is not just a meal. It is ceremonial, from the hand-washing, to the presentation of the evolution of Rumari and all its beautiful intentions to create an incredible experience for all its customers. As it was explained to us, we felt the connection to nature, and the human to human connection. We encourage everyone to try the 7 or 9 step journey at Rumari for dinner. Must try at Loloan, is the seafood platter for two with the Asian spice. Wow People: shout out to the entire team at Raffles Bali, from Chef Gaetan, the management team, Krishna our butler, Bagus, Wisnu ... for making our trip extra special. The rest of the team, mega, a-anne, Wira, Lani, Martino and everyone else, Raffles Bali is in our hearts and we can't wait to visit again. Home Search Trips Review"

When I was there, I joined the baby turtle release, it was the cutest thing ever. Thank you Raffles Bali for including me and the family as part of your sustainability program, my children love them.

"37.","Tym","82","2025-04-01","5","The Raffles Bali is nestled in the north western corner of the Bukit peninsula , overlooking the Jimbaran bay. The property is just under 4 years old having opened just at the tail end of Covid. I had heard varying reviews of the property and being Singaporean with a soft spot for our heritage this was a chance to experience the magic of ‘Raffles’ in one of my favourite places on earth. First things first, this property is very well designed and built. From the long drive in to the magnificent lobby building to the thoughtfully located villas sculptured into the jimbaran hillside, this is a re-creation of a Balinese village enhanced by nature. We were fortunate to stay at the panoramic pool villa, a palatial one bedroom villa with its private infinity pool. The views are stunning especially at sunset with the outline of Mount Agung in the distance overlooking the lights of ships in the bay and the planes arriving at the Ngurah Rai landing strip. You could spend many an evening lost in luxury and natural beauty while lazing at the bale or in the pool. The hotel activities and spa are geared towards wellness and soul enhancement. All this can be arranged through your personal butler. The hotels signature restaurant Rumari and more casual beach front Loloan are top notch for service and cuisine. This is the place to come if you want privacy and a peaceful retreat. It is expensive but if your budget allows for it there are few places in Bali that rival its heritage, glamour and luxury."

"42.","Warren Kok","647","2025-03-01","5","One of my best villa resort stays on the Islands of the Gods is Raffles Bali which is nestled charmingly on the hilltop of the Jimbaran Bay in Bali.. with my very own exclusive and cosy Ocean Pool Villa sea-fronting the I GustinNgurah Rai International Airport so I can capture the moment of each plane taking off from the runway. Upon entry to the entrance of this beautiful and tranquil resort are a pair of Rindik players welcoming guests, to the fascinating sounds of Balinese music! Such serenity, calmness and peace! Surrounded by lush tropical gardens, the beautifully designed resort is a harmonious blend of contemporary comforts and unspoilt nature. I could just wake up in the morning to the sounds and melodies of the various avian species, giving their natural wake-up calls, just amazingly serene, whilst taking in the beauty of the Jimbaran Bay area. Food is well curated; butler service most caring and attentive, luxurious and refined, spa is amazing top bodywork in the therapy, concepts and sustainability well defined, awesome! Full of nature, flora and fauna Overall rating 9.6/10"

The hotel has great facilities and views, even better than the luxury I’ve seen at other top hotels. At first, I felt something was missing in the service - it wasn’t as warm as I expected, especially since it was my first day and I didn’t meet any of the hotel’s managers, which was a first for me at a five-star hotel. But things got better on the second day. The staff really paid attention to what my family liked, especially at breakfast. They remembered our food preferences, which made us feel really cared for. The hotel’s restaurant, Loloan, and the SPA were both excellent and worth trying. Overall, after a bit of a slow start, the service got much better, and I ended up really enjoying my stay at Raffles Hotel. The personal touches made a big difference."
"44.","Edward Chi","45","2025-01-01","5","Have you had a dream that you wished never ended? That’s how I feel about my stay at Raffles Bali. Once you leave, any other hotel you stay at, you will wish you were back at Raffles Bali. You will not be able to stop yourself comparing how any subsequent hotels you stay at are somehow missing that Raffles touch. This is a private villa only property. The attention to detail is second to none. There is a sense of balance throughout the property. The architecture of the villas, pathway and rock placements to your villa, all plants are perfectly cared for, none or dry, limping or not of place. Service and the butlers are well-mannered and are delightful in every aspect. This is like wearing a well-tailored suit versus buying off the rack. No matter how famous or luxurious the brand, it’s not quite as good as a well-tailored one. I’m happy to have experienced Raffles Bali and would have no reservations in recommending it to any luxury traveler with a subtle and discerning for luxury."

"47.","Ahmed Al-Emadi","194","2025-03-01","5","We've been to many high end resorts accross Asia and Africa, but the team in Raffles Bali takes service to new heights. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary during our stay and we were truly treated with effortless kindness, attentivemess and generosity. Our personal butler, Sila, was remarkably always available and making sure that all our requests and wishes were attended to. The ladies and gents (Vidia, Rinia and the rest of the team) treated us with the outmost unpretentious hospitality, telling us stories about the culture and the food and made us feel truly welcomed. The recommendations for local dishes were spot on the company of the Raffles team made every meal into a special memory. The villa was elegantly luxurious yet simple, with everything exactly where it should be. The supply of local goodies (and coffee)which were all of outstanding quality, and the daily supply of tea, were also among the things that made the resort stand out and we truly enjoyed and appreciates. All in all, remarkable!"
"48.","Fab Foodie Swede Malin Nordblom","263","2025-01-01","5","Very few places like this! The villas are true retreats, where you actually feel that it’s all about you. View, bed, bath, treats, pool.. Well it’s all here! You get a butler who can assist you if you need some help. All the food here is based on as much local produce as possible. Did I leave the hotel when I was here, no! I was enjoying every day as it was the last! A must is to eat at their fantastic restaurant Rumari, I will make a special post about it."
"49.","Nai","62","2025-01-01","5","I have stayed in a few Raffles hotels - but this is by far the best one. Customer service is beyond exceptional and the food is excellent. We also had the Cave dinner experience and afternoon - would recommend."

Thank you to Rina for being so thoughtful to take care of our dietary habit every day.Thank you to Joselyn for offering to be our photographer and taking great photos for us. There has been so many people who I would like to say thank you. In a word, Thank you so much Raffles Bali for leaving us an incredible and unforgettable honeymoon experience in my life. Thanks for being amazing and I definitely will come back."
"51.","Soto Spinos","95","2025-01-01","4","Beautiful Property and excellent restaurant but several certain items need work. The villas at this luxury hotel are stunning, with Japanese influences and gorgeous bay views. Outdoor lighting though was lacking. The restaurants are a highlight, serving top-quality food. The pool area is also very pleasant. The BBQ in villas servers endless food :)! Unfortunately, the hotel's service accommodating its guests through internet or noise disruptions is simply poor. The gym is inadequate, the WiFi connection has dead spot almost everywhere or it’s unusable, and there is construction work happening up until 9pm causing noise to the villas. At the beach you can’t swim in the sea. Overall, this hotel has the potential to be fantastic once they iron out the service, noise, and internet issues. If you value beautiful surroundings and great food over everything else, it might work for you. If you need a secluded quiet place currently it might night be the right place. (April 2024) Call to ask. The pricing over some activities is inconsistent causing some frustration but generally I found that mostly it didn’t reflect any quality for the asking price. The secret cave dining experience is really unique and recommended. Overall the F&B and its service provided was consistently excellent."
"52.","Nitesh Goyal","1","2025-01-01","1","We were aghast by the lack of empathy that the hotel team displayed towards us as guests, after the problem between the hotel and their travel advisor. This had nothing to do with us but this destroyed our entire experience at the hotel. We initially booked for 3 nights, but owing to the poor experience, we checked out after 1 night itself."
"53.","Amri Syukur","11","2024-01-01","5","Raffles Bali and it was an absolutely magical experience. From the moment I stepped foot in the hotel, I was greeted with warm smiles and exceptional service. The attention to detail in every aspect of the hotel was remarkable, from the stunning architecture to the beautifully landscaped gardens. The room was a haven of luxury and comfort, with breathtaking views and exquisite furnishings. The staff went above and beyond to ensure that every moment of my stay was perfect, anticipating my needs and providing personalized service. The dining options at Raffles Bali were a culinary delight, with an array of delectable dishes crafted with the finest ingredients. The spa was a sanctuary of relaxation, offering rejuvenating treatments that left me feeling pampered and refreshed. Raffles Bali truly exceeded my expectations and created unforgettable memories. I highly recommend this exceptional hotel to anyone seeking a truly luxurious and unforgettable experience in Bali."
"54.","Zaid Imam","57","2024-01-01","5","An incredible one night stay. When the four seasons next door failed to deliver with run down rooms, a rat and cockroaches, we left for the raffles bali for our last night in a bad mood and lots of disappointment. The staff, service and the property at Raffles took this disappointment and blew it into the air. We were met by our personal concierge and welcomed by the general manager whom we saw twice during our stay. We were met with phenomenal service, impeccable care, and state of the art villas. The property is brand new and incredibly quiet. It was perfect for our honeymoon, the space was incredible, the views fantastic and truly the online posted pictures do not do the villas justice (the view and vibes are even better). Strongly recommended for couples going on romantic getaways for a pleasant, quiet and enjoyable luxurious experience."
"55.","Emily Zhou","4","2025-01-01","5","Bella is extremely good, team Raffles made sure we had an enjoyable stay even for 1 night. However the construction site is a bit unpleasant especially there are noises throughout the day."

The staff that works there is so caring and thoughtful, I enjoyed every moment. One of the best luxury hotels in Bali, I strongly recommend!"
"57.","Tanu","10","2025-01-01","5","We had a great time staying at Raffles for 5 nights . The staff are very friendly and very helpful . Our butler Gaby was very helpful and the other butlers in her absence . A big thank you to Rina and her team at Rumari Resturant , we were so spoilt at breakfast with local fruits , Rina went out of her way to source my favorite local fruits and packed extra for my ride on checkout day . We also tried local cuisine that she managed to organize as we are vegetarian so were limited to the menu . Big thank you also to Loloan Resturant , the staff there were great . The chef went out of his way and made a beautiful curry that was not part of the menu , despite short notice . The villa was very cleaned very well , was neat and tidy morning and evening , a big thank you to the service team . Overall - a great stay and left with our pot filled with so much love 🙏🙏🙏👌👌👌"
"58.","S W","139","2024-01-01","5","We had an amazing time here. It was definitely the best 5 star hotel in bali. The whole experience is unique and luxurious. All the villas are with good privacy and with good distance to other villas. The hotel really knows what you need, and they have everything you need ready at the villa for you. The infinity pool is beautifully built in every villa. The staffs here are very caring and they make you feel like you are home! I am definitely coming back again!"

"65.","pratama almahdaly","134","2025-01-01","1","Review of Raffles Bali Pre-arrival Communication: Throughout the pre-arrival process, there were multiple reminders regarding cancellation fees, despite the accommodation bill being settled in advance. While appreciating the thoroughness of the process, it seemed a tad excessive given the circumstances. Arrival Experience: Upon arrival, our experience was marked by delays in being located by the airport staff, a less-than-ideal first impression while claimed to be VIP greeting. Staff Demeanor: Throughout our stay, we encountered a sense of uptight from the staff, which, while questionably professional, occasionally veered towards a more unpleasant demeanor. A warmer and more welcoming approach could elevate the overall guest experience. Amenities: The resort boasts an array of amenities that undoubtedly enhance the guest experience. However, we did notice some oversights in the setup, such as nearly expired products, which could benefit from closer attention to detail. Room Amenity Replenishment: While the room amenities were undoubtedly luxurious, we did notice some inconsistency in their replenishment. A more standardized approach to this aspect of the guest experience could further enhance the stay. Butler Service: Our interactions with the butler service highlighted some challenges, particularly in arranging certain activities. While we appreciate the effort, there were instances where our requests were not fully met, indicating a potential area for improvement. Food and Service: The culinary offerings at Raffles Bali are commendable, showcasing a blend of creativity and culinary expertise. However, there were occasional instances of order misunderstandings and overcooked dishes, which, while a few, were noticeable. Cleanliness: The cleanliness of the resort is undoubtedly paramount, and for the most part, it was maintained to a high standard. However, we did notice a few isolated instances, such as greasy plates and stained jugs, which detracted from the overall experience. Restaurant Limitations: While understanding the challenges of managing a conceptual dining experience, we were disappointed not to be able to accommodate a simple request at Rumari. With low occupancy levels, we believed such flexibility could have been extended. Luxury = Freedom. Management Response: Throughout our stay, there was a notable absence of proactive management intervention. While we did receive a gracious apology upon departure from Ms. Bernadine, we felt a more timely and proactive approach to addressing issues during our stay would have been appreciated. Overall Disappointment: Reflecting on our time at Raffles Bali, there were moments of disappointment amidst the beauty of the surroundings and the luxury of the amenities. It's important to acknowledge these moments with humility, recognizing that there is always room for improvement. Service Over Amenities: In the reality of luxury hospitality, it's often the personalized service that leaves the most lasting impression. While the amenities at Raffles Bali are undoubtedly impressive, a renewed focus on delivering exceptional service could further elevate the guest experience. Recognition of Notable Staff: Through our observations, it's important to highlight the exemplary efforts of certain staff members who went above and beyond to ensure our comfort and satisfaction. Their dedication is a testament to the caliber of service at Raffles Bali. Nik, Aan, all therapists at the Spa, and Ms Sophia (Director of Spa and Retail). Concept: While the resort's physical attributes are undeniably stunning, we couldn't help but feel that there was a missed opportunity to infuse more personality into the overall concept. A more distinct and cohesive theme could further enrich the guest experience. In conclusion, our time at Raffles Bali was marked by moments of both delight and reflection. While there is certainly room for improvement, we remain grateful for the opportunity to experience the beauty of this resort and look forward to witnessing its ongoing evolution"

"68.","Das Tian","135","2024-01-01","5","I recently had the pleasure of staying at Raffles Bali, and I have to say, it exceeded all of my expectations. From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with warm hospitality and top-notch service. The resort itself is spread out over 23 hectares of lush greenery, making it the perfect place to relax and unwind. The 32 villas are all beautifully designed and equipped with everything you need for a comfortable stay. One of the things that really stood out to me about Raffles Bali was the attention to detail. From the complimentary food and drinks in the room (excluding alcohol) to the small touches like the phone holder in the toilet, it was clear that the staff went above and beyond to make my stay as enjoyable as possible. High tech toilet & outdoor bathroom very nice experience. Nice private pool. The resort is perfect for those looking for a private, romantic getaway. Whether you're on your honeymoon or just looking to escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life, Raffles Bali offers the perfect setting. It's also great for families, as there are plenty of activities and amenities to keep everyone entertained. I was also impressed by the surprise that the staff had prepared for me during my stay. The dinner was delicious and the ambiance was both comfortable and romantic. They have prepared for dinner in Bale or in the cave. Overall, I had an amazing experience at Raffles Bali and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a luxurious and relaxing vacation. Thank you to the staff for making my stay so special. I can't wait to come back! 🥳 Special thanks to Bu Mony / Monita 🙌"

"72.","Yeeling Tan","6","2024-01-01","5","This was our first trip abroad with our one year old, and we were nervous about bringing her on holiday. These concerns were so unfounded as Raffles Bali went above and beyond. One of the best trips we’ve ever taken, and that’s saying something. 1. Luxurious While rates are expensive, you really do pay for what you get. Even from the moment we entered the lobby, we were immediately greeted by a vast expanse of mountains and hilltops. It was beautiful and really sold how luxurious Raffles Bali was at first glance. The rooms were so comfortable, cozy, and beautiful. The view we had from our villa was amazing and we loved just chilling in the villa with our little one. 2. Staff The staff went above and beyond. Again, I felt nervous bringing my little girl on a trip but the staff was sooo attentive that I really didn’t have to worry at all. They brought out a grilled fish for her not on the menu because they noticed (from a dinner she had the day before) that she liked fish. Also, special shout-out to our butler Wintara. Everything was fuss free and easy for us because of him and the staff at Raffles Bali. For example, it’s really the little things like the staff calling for the buggy unprompted when we get the bill at the restaurant. Everyone is attentive, friendly, and so hospitable. 3. Kid friendly Very good quality cots, they have sterilizers here, babysitting services, catered menus for babies (our little one doesn’t do sugar and salt and the staff prepared versions of food on the menu without salt and sugar). I was so incredibly impressed and appreciative that they went the extra mile to cater to her and our needs. There are many a plenty of beautiful villas and hotels around the world. For me and my husband, Raffles Bali stood out not only because of the rooms, but also due to the impeccable service offered here. Would love to be back once more! Thank you everyone for the incredible experience you bestowed upon us :)"
"73.","Shawna Little Calderwood","13","2025-09-01","5","I’ve been a Raffles customer for decades but it was my first time at this property.

Highly recommend!"
"74.","Otmar Sery","29","2024-01-01","5","Raffles Bali Nusa is a beautiful hotel resort that provided us with an exceptional experience. We were accommodated in a stunning villa with a breathtaking view of the sea, where in the distance and tranquility, we could observe airplanes arriving and departing. The villa was situated in a serene and picturesque location on a hillside within a vast green garden. Other villas were also strategically placed to ensure guests did not disturb each other and maintained privacy. The interior was clean and cozy, and the natural design of the surroundings captivated us, including such small details as an outdoor shower and gazebo. The hotel staff was incredibly attentive and kind, with our personal butler, Mr. Aditya Suryaputra, always available, exceptionally courteous, and attentive. One of us arrived at the resort with back pain after a flight, and Mr. Aditya, without us asking, noticed the discomfort and arranged for a muscle-relaxing cream and a hot stone massage at the hotel wellness center. This ultimately helped, and the back pain completely healed within two days. Mr. Aditya was always at our service, and I must say, he was the most attentive butler we have ever encountered in hotel resorts. He went above and beyond his duties to make our stay as pleasant as possible. Overall, the other employees were excellent, from breakfast, at the SPA, in the hotel bars, to the restaurants during dinner. The meals became a complete gastronomic experience. Not only did they taste absolutely delicious, but they were also beautifully arranged on the plate in a Japanese style. The combination of delectable flavors and stunning design brought an incredible gastronomic experience that we fondly remember. Although staying at the Raffles Bali Nusa resort is certainly not the cheapest option, the quality of the services is truly worth it. The attention and warmth provided were felt at every step. The resort thus becomes an excellent place for relaxation, unwinding, and enjoying one of the most beautiful places in Bali. Overall, Raffles Bali Nusa can definitely be recommended for any visitor looking for a luxurious and relaxing place for a vacation."

Impeccable service and attention down to the last detail, be it in the villa or anywhere else in the resort. Our butler Wintara mentioned we were actually his first guests at the resort but we would’ve never guessed, he was flawless and went the extra mile whenever he could. Highly recommended if you’re in the mood for a splurge away from the bustling crowds of Canggu."

"79.","I C","39","2024-01-01","5","Perched atop a hill in the exclusive neighbourhood of Jimbaran Bali, Raffles Bali is a private oasis for those seeking to unwind and rejuvenate. The Resort only has 32 villas, and each comes with a private infinity pool and an unobstructed view of the Indian Ocean. There was plenty of space within the villa and never once was there any disturbance (i.e., noise from neighbours or the nearby airport). Each room is also assigned a personal wellbeing butler, and ours, Mr Aditya, was amazing!g! We felt entirely at ease knowing that we're so well-taken care of! The food at Rumari was amazing. We appreciate the small portion sizes at breakfast, which allowed us to try a variety of dishes; each one exquisitely done! The tasting menu we had during dinner at Rumari, was another highlight of our stay, particularly after being told that the ingredients were mainly sourced from within Indonesia, as well as Raffles Bali's commitment to supporting local farmers and enterprises. All in all, amongst all of our visits and hotel stays in Bali, Raffles easily tops them. One truly has to be here to experience it all for yourself!"

We had our butler, Ariyanti (and Pinky sometimes), help us with all bookings and transportation within the hotel. Thank you both for all your assistance. Aire and Manik were our spa therapists here, and I just can't describe how friendly and professional they are. We truly enjoyed our spa experience at the sanctuary. As usual for us, we value the staff and the service the most, and this was remarkable here at Raffles. Views, INCREDIBLE FOOD, great service, and tranquil privacy were out highlights.

The scallops and the beef is a must try, a lot of the other dishes are fusion with indonesia flavors. The cheese are locally made in Java which is interesting. You can also opt to upgrade to Krug package. Important, you must book in advance and need to provide deposit otherwise they won't take walk in. Did I mention the view over the cliff and the airport is pretty good. They have indoor seating option too if you don't like windy."

"89.","Afandi Darmanegara","2","2025-01-01","3","There is a new hotel being built. They even do lound knocking starting at 8am. Very annoying and they can't do anything about it and no notice at all. AVOID this hotel in these two years, unless you don't mind construction sound."
"90.","Adam Wontowski","10","2023-01-01","5","We joined amazing brunch on Feb 6 and were really astonished by the level of service, quality of food and unforgettable ambience. If you do look for intimate, tailor made and high ranked place for your romantic tête-à-tête or close friends circle, that’s probably the best choice We’ve been in all Michelin and 5* luxury stars places here in Bali and abroad, but what’s so special about Raffles and this Rumari restaurant - it gives you a pure feeling of a speciality and royalty from head to toes, same like in the Us or European countries. If you’d join a brunch, don’t help trying the duck features and lobster dish. It’s served with a hint of black caviar and truffle oil which gives an amazing perception of high cuisine. We also tried “the Indonesian journey” dinner the other night with our friends and that was a true gastronomy adventure, highly recommended for a company of 3-5 people! I would mark it 10 out of 5. Amazing, delicious and very ambient"
"91.","Soetjipto Hoeijaja","3","2023-01-01","5","Raffles Bali is a magnificent spot for quality time just within the hotel, as the hotel provides the best facilities; from legendary ‘The Writers Bar’ and its signature ‘Bali Sling’ cocktail to stunning secluded beach; from spa surrounded by the forest into meditation in nature’s cave. One thing that I won’t forget for such a long time is the outstanding and knowledgeable service from our Raffles Wellbeing Butler (Sri) who took care every agendas from airport pick-up to unique experience such as seeing Jimbaran fisherman in action or just visiting Balinese traditional house. I should also mention about their foods (breakfast, lunch and dinner) that was way better than i ever expected - definitely some of the best food I had in Bali. Chef Gaetan, Chef Agung and his team were remarkable. Not to mention the genuine attention and knowledge from the waiters that exceeded my expectation."
"92.","Me","33","2021-01-01","5","Spend a couple of nights, new hotel in Jimbaran area. Joyful experience was well memorized in our life. Elegant architectural design and put attention to every single detail. Top notch recommendation."
"93.","HH","9","2022-01-01","5","I had amazing stay with Raffles Bali for 3 days 2 nights. Definitely will come back again anytime soon! I recommend their Hill Top Villa overlooking both Ubud vibes and Ocean. Amazing!! 😊 …"
"94.","Arvin Hartanto","203","2022-01-01","5","Best resort villa and service in Bali so far! Four thumbs up 👍👍👍👍 Enchanted by the careful masterplan and design, looks simple but super stunning. Amazed by combination of ubud-look jungle view, rocky river, beautiful semi-private white soft sand beach, jimbaran rocks & cliff, cave and best sea-view from bedroom. Serene location and beautiful landscape. Simply manificent👍 Food was great. There were many choices for breakfast from fruits, pastry, vegan, western & Indonesian meals. Dinner at Loloan was great as well, mixed grill seafood was comparable taste to Jimbaran seafood plus better services. 👍 Service was awesome. Got personalized butler from pre-arrival until check out. 2x room tidy up, during breakfast and dinner, and got special snack + drink every afternoon. Very thoughtful services, best so far in Bali 👍"

"97.","Nasrullah Taufik","2","2021-01-01","5","Me and my wife have recently spent a 4-day stay in Raffles Bali. Everything about our stay was a testament to the hotel’s genuine care and commitment to create a unique and memorable experience for their guests. Each morning, we enjoyed a delightful breakfast at Rumari Restaurant, which is perched on the resort’s highest point for a stunning ocean view. That is, before a relaxing Yoga Class on the Meditation Terrace overlooking a beautiful panorama. In terms of its other dining venues, Raffles Bali has tons to offer. We loved Loloan Beach Bar & Grill not only for its excellent views and foods, but also the sense of privacy. This restaurant is available only for hotel guests to enjoy the masterful delicacies of Chef Agung. The Secret Cave Intimate Dinner was another wonderful surprise from Raffles Bali (we were the first couple graced with this romantic candlelight dinner), with the Black Winter Truffle being the night’s highlight. The live jazz music performance on sunset cocktail at The Writers Bar made the experience even more personalized, as they beautifully sang our favourite song. Meanwhile, Rumari Unearthing was a unique dinner experience where we could try various Balinese dishes. It was an unending shower of gastronomic masterpieces! Moreover, we also found the afternoon tea at The Writers Bar extremely unique as they served 18 different tea options from Dammann Frères. Not to mention the utterly rejuvenating Raffles Signature Massage by Mbak Wirati, Mbak Lestari and Mbak Ayu from Raffles Spa. Very relaxing! We’d like to give a shoutout to Chef Gaetan, Chef Eka, Chef Agung, Mas Kevin, Mas Gusti, Mas Erlangga, Mas Putu, Mas Saputra, Mbak Nick, Mbak Rina, Mbak Sisca, Mas Yogi, Mbak Wirati, Mbak Ayu, Mbak Lestariall and all of whom have taken care of us throughout our stay and ensured our comfort. But our greatest thanks are reserved for Mas Kevin, our dedicated Wellbeing Butler who has made this an exceptionally memorable stay for us. There are no words that can express how extraordinary he had been, with all the surprises and care that he showed us. Indeed, Mas Kevin has set the bar of hospitality services very high for us. We’d also like to express our endless gratitude to Ibu Katya, Dayu and Irma who have made our stay even more special. Overall, we feel that Raffles Bali has truly outdone themselves with their hospitality and immaculate services. I am a huge believer in the Raffles brand from now on. Hope we will back here again!"

"367.","GIGI","10","2025-09-01","5","Saya memilih Hotel Raffles untuk tiga malam terakhir saya, karena ingin mengakhiri masa inap saya dengan nyaman di dekat bandara. Saya memesan mobil Raffles dari Mandapa Ritz-Carlton, dan saya terkesan dengan ketelitian mereka dalam memeriksa kondisi, termasuk Wi-Fi dan suhu. Saat check-in, pemandangan hutan dan laut terbentang di depan mata saya, meninggalkan rasa gembira. Setelah berada di hutan Ubud, pemandangan lautnya sangat menyegarkan, dan saya dapat menikmati pertunjukan udara yang berlangsung bersamaan selama dua hari dari kamar saya. Tempat tidurnya luas, sehingga nyaman untuk kami bertiga, termasuk seorang anak. Sistem suaranya sangat bagus, sehingga ideal untuk pesta kolam renang. Namun, ada pesta di kamar sebelah, jadi agak berisik. Spa-nya agak mengecewakan karena kurangnya keterampilan teknis, dan sarapannya, meskipun à la carte, kurang beragam pilihannya dibandingkan hotel lain. Yang saya lewatkan adalah lobster Bali yang saya nikmati di restoran di sebelah kolam renang utama. Sebagai orang tua dengan anak-anak, bagian terbaiknya adalah air kolam renang yang dihangatkan oleh sinar matahari, sehingga sempurna untuk berenang. Namun, lantainya memang terlihat berjamur dan ada beberapa puing yang mengapung, yang tampaknya perlu dirawat. Layanan butlernya sangat memuaskan. Di resor lain, permintaan terkadang tertunda 10-20 menit, tetapi di Raffles, timnya bekerja sama, sehingga respons selalu dalam 2-3 menit. Secara keseluruhan, ini adalah pengalaman yang memuaskan, dan saya pasti akan kembali ke resor ini lagi."
"368.","Gonthier matthieu","19","2025-09-01","5","Hotel ini sungguh luar biasa. Kualitas lokasi dan stafnya membuat Anda merasa seperti di rumah sendiri dari awal hingga akhir. Stafnya bekerja keras untuk memberikan semua kenyamanan yang kami inginkan. Terima kasih banyak kepada Endah, pelayan pribadi kami, yang sungguh luar biasa. Kami berharap dapat segera kembali ke hotel ini dan sangat merekomendasikannya."
"369.","김막장","2","2025-09-01","5","Saya sudah menginap di banyak kamar yang bagus dan makanan yang lezat, tapi ini adalah liburan yang sempurna. Semuanya sudah disiapkan, dan semuanya disesuaikan dengan kebutuhan saya."
"370.","Maribel Liébanas Serra","4","2025-09-01","2","Tak diragukan lagi, ini salah satu hotel terbaik di Bali, tetapi kesan pertama kami mengecewakan. Setibanya di kamar, kami melihat deretan apartemen dengan derek yang terus beroperasi, terlihat dari kamar mandi kami. Sejak awal, kami sudah bilang ini bukan yang kami pesan. Kami memesan vila dengan pemandangan taman, bukan pemandangan derek. Manajemen hotel menunjukkan dua vila alternatif, masing-masing lebih buruk dari yang lain. Akhirnya kami serius, dan mereka memberi kami vila baru yang tidak terlihat konstruksinya. Namun, kami menghabiskan dua hari tanpa tahu vila mana yang kami miliki, tanpa membongkar tas, seolah-olah kami sedang dipinjamkan. Perasaan itu cukup mengecewakan, terutama ketika Anda menginap di hotel semahal itu. Salah satu manajer memberi tahu kami bahwa dari 32 vila, mereka hanya bisa menjual 22 vila, tetapi vila yang awalnya mereka berikan kepada kami adalah salah satu dari 10 vila yang tidak bisa dijual. Kami mengerti bahwa saat itu sedang musim ramai, tetapi jarang sekali hotel semahal itu terjual mengingat adanya konstruksi. Seandainya kami tahu, kami pasti akan menginap di tempat lain. Pelayanan stafnya sangat baik, semua orang sangat perhatian dan profesional. Raffles Bali adalah surga kuliner; restoran-restorannya sungguh patut dikunjungi."
"371.","이용식","44","2025-09-01","5","Suasana yang tenang dan menenangkan di dalam kompleks resor. Nikmati kolam renang infinity yang menghadap Laut Jimbaran. Pelayanan butler yang penuh perhatian dan profesional. Terbaik."
"372.","Sy Cho","92","2025-06-01","5","Pemandangannya luar biasa. Sampo dan kondisionernya dalam wadah kaca, bukan botol pompa, yang membuat saya sedikit ragu tentang kebersihannya (air bisa masuk, dan saat membersihkan kamar, Anda harus mengosongkan isinya, mencuci wadah kaca, mengeringkannya, lalu mengisinya kembali. Wadah kacanya cukup besar, jadi mengosongkannya terasa kurang efisien). Selain itu, semuanya sempurna. Kami juga menikmati sarapan à la carte yang santai dengan pemandangan laut yang indah dan angin sepoi-sepoi. Itu adalah pengalaman terbaik yang pernah ada. Sama sekali tidak panas meskipun kami makan di luar. Saya juga menyukai banyaknya tempat teduh di dekat kolam renang. Saya ingin berkunjung lagi. ㅜㅜ"
"373.","Ray Lee","1","2025-04-01","5","Saya sangat terkesan dengan layanan profesional yang saya terima, yang disesuaikan dengan kebutuhan saya. Saya ingin sekali lagi menyampaikan rasa terima kasih saya yang tulus kepada pelayan pribadi saya, Bapak Thomson, dan Bapak Dika dari Restoran Rumari karena telah membuat masa menginap saya begitu menyenangkan. Saya sangat puas dengan kamar, spa, dan yoga, dan terutama sarapan dan makan malam, serta menu layanan kamar yang lezat. Terima kasih."
"374.","laura","16","2025-02-01","5","Ini resor terbaik. Mereka menjemput kami dengan BMW dan mengantar kami ke bandara dalam perjalanan pulang. Mereka menyiapkan camilan dan teh di dalam mobil, yang membuatnya sangat nyaman dan praktis. Kami mengalami sedikit masalah dengan kamar setelah check-in, tetapi mereka menyelesaikannya dengan cepat dan kami merasa nyaman menginap di sana. 😊 Sarapannya juga lezat! Saya sangat merekomendasikannya. Terima kasih!♪ Terima kasih kepada pelayan kami, Krishna dan Seva!♪ Terima kasih telah melayani kami! 🎵☺️Terima kasih telah melayani kami!"
"375.","굴러굴러","4","2025-11-01","5","Itu benar-benar pengalaman yang memuaskan dan sempurna, dan saya ingin mengucapkan rasa terima kasih saya kepada kepala pelayan saya yang berdedikasi, Seva."
"376.","Martin Rohrer","932","2025-01-01","5","Awalnya, saya agak skeptis dengan ulasan hotel yang sangat baik. Sayangnya, saya beberapa kali kecewa akhir-akhir ini. Dan di sini? Tidak, Raffles memang hotel yang sempurna. Saya orang yang hampir terobsesi dengan detail. Saya bisa masuk ke hotel dan kekurangannya langsung terlihat. Di sini? Tidak ada, tidak ada satu pun kesalahan atau kecerobohan. Mari kita mulai dari awal: Kami disambut di bandara setelah imigrasi. Staf sudah siap dan menunggu kami. Mereka membantu kami dengan bagasi dan mengantar kami ke mobil, yang kemudian mengantar kami ke hotel. Bukan, bukan sembarang mobil. Sebuah BMW X7 di Bali. Di dalam mobil, kejutan berikutnya: minuman, kacang, cokelat, semua yang Anda inginkan. Dan perjalanan ke resor sebenarnya hanya memakan waktu sekitar 30 hingga 40 menit. Sayang sekali, mengingat pelayanannya. Pintu masuk hotel sama spektakulernya. Salah satu jalan masuk terpanjang yang pernah saya nikmati. Indah, megah, dan hampir sepanjang rumah bangsawan di sebuah county. Di ujung jalan masuk yang panjang terdapat bangunan utama hotel beserta lobinya. Tidak megah, tidak terlalu ramai, tetapi sangat mengundang. Mata saya yang terlatih telah mengamati detail-detailnya: semua material berkualitas tinggi dan terpasang dengan sempurna. Kemudian, Anda akan disambut oleh pelayan. Katya memperkenalkan dirinya secara singkat. Kemudian, Anda pergi ke area tempat duduk yang nyaman di mana Anda akan menerima minuman selamat datang dan formalitas pun selesai. Katya datang lagi dan kali ini memperkenalkan dirinya lebih detail. Dia adalah General Manager hotel. Saya selalu merasa senang ketika seorang General Manager meluangkan waktu untuk menyambut para tamu. Kami datang sedikit lebih awal, jadi vila kami belum siap. Namun, kami ditawari solusi sementara, tetapi kami pergi makan siang di pantai terlebih dahulu. Tamannya dirancang dengan indah. Anda dapat menikmati jalan setapak menuju pantai dari dalam mobil buggy. Dan di sana juga: setiap karyawan tahu nama kami dan kami dipanggil dengan nama. Luar biasa. Sampai sekarang, saya hanya pernah merasakan layanan seperti itu di kapal-kapal Seabourn yang lebih kecil (dulu, sayangnya tidak sebaik itu lagi). Setelah makan malam, vila sudah siap. Begitu masuk, Anda akan menyadari betapa detailnya. Semuanya berkualitas sangat tinggi dan terpasang dengan kualitas yang tidak akan Anda temukan di Asia. Dari pintu geser soft-close, toilet shower Toto, hingga perlengkapan shower Grohe. Semuanya berkualitas sangat tinggi dan dalam kondisi sempurna. Dan pemandangan dari vila di atas bukit? Tak ternilai harganya. Anda bangun di pagi hari dan dapat melihat laut dari tempat tidur Anda. Dan semua ini dengan privasi penuh, sesuatu yang tidak akan Anda temukan di resor. Itulah kemewahan. Tidak ada sarapan prasmanan di sini. Itu juga tidak sesuai dengan gaya hotel. Ada sarapan à la carte dengan semua yang Anda inginkan. Ditambah lagi, layanannya tak tertandingi. Para pelayan juga mengingat minuman yang Anda pesan, jadi keesokan harinya Anda akan ditanya apakah Anda ingin cappuccino lagi, misalnya. Sempurna. Kedua restoran ini juga layak dikunjungi di malam hari. Saya sudah memberi penilaian masing-masing. Dan sehari sebelum keberangkatan? Saya belum pernah mengalami hal seperti itu. Pelayan kami sudah menghubungi hotel berikutnya untuk menanyakan kapan kamar kami tersedia. Karena kami ingin check-in lebih awal di sana, tetapi kemungkinan besar tidak memungkinkan, ia memperpanjang masa tinggal kami di vila hingga pukul 14.00. Dengan cara ini, pelayan kami memastikan liburan kami berjalan lancar. Terima kasih. Intinya: Perangkat kerasnya, yaitu fasilitasnya, sempurna. Namun, dan ini mungkin yang lebih penting, hotel ini berkembang pesat berkat perangkat lunak yang sempurna, yaitu stafnya. Mereka sangat terlatih, penuh perhatian, dan senang bekerja di sana. Anda langsung menyadari hal ini sebagai tamu."
"377.","Anton Mar","17","2025-05-01","5","Kami mengunjungi spa-nya. Tempatnya luar biasa dan pelayanannya luar biasa! Saat Anda datang, spa-nya milik Anda sendiri, dan seluruh areanya bisa Anda gunakan. Kami pasti akan kembali."
"378.","吳珮綺","31","2024-01-01","5","Perjalanan pertama saya sejak pandemi sungguh unik dan menyenangkan! Semua orang, baik di dalam maupun di luar vila, selalu tersenyum tulus dan menyapa dengan hangat. Meskipun kendala bahasa membuat komunikasi agak sulit, hal itu tidak mengurangi layanan yang penuh perhatian, sabar, dan penuh perhatian dari setiap orang yang berinteraksi dengan kami. Mereka memperhatikan setiap detail kecil: siapa yang mau air mineral? siapa yang mau limun? Cukup bertanya di hari pertama, mereka sudah menyiapkannya keesokan harinya. Mereka bahkan mengatur tempat duduk kami di restoran. Ketika kami kembali ke hotel setelah bertamasya, teh hangat dan buah segar selalu tersedia di kamar kami... Semuanya menghangatkan hati saya. Lima hari empat malam kami di sini sungguh luar biasa dan tak terlupakan! Staf Raffles yang bekerja keras, dengan perhatian dan kehangatan mereka yang selalu ada, menghangatkan hati dan pikiran kami. Saya sangat bersyukur! Terima kasih! Mengucapkan selamat tinggal pada perjalanan pertama di masa pandemi, izinkan saya merasakan pengalaman menginap yang unik dan penuh kejutan! Semua staf di dalam dan di luar Villa selalu tersenyum tulus dan memberikan salam hangat setiap saat. Mungkin ada kendala bahasa dan agak sulit untuk berkomunikasi, tetapi tidak ada salahnya jika semua orang yang berhubungan dengan kami akan melayani dengan penuh perhatian, kesabaran, dan dedikasi! Perhatian terhadap setiap detail kecil: siapa yang minum air mineral? Siapa yang minum limun? Kami hanya bertanya pada hari pertama, dan langsung menyiapkannya sejak hari kedua; bahkan kursi restoran pun langsung diatur agar kami dapat duduk; setelah bermain dan kembali ke hotel, teh hangat dan buah-buahan segar selalu disiapkan di kamar...semua ini menghangatkan hati saya. Lima hari empat malam di sini sungguh luar biasa dan tak terlupakan! Semua staf Raffles yang bekerja keras, perhatian yang selalu ada kapan pun, di mana pun, tak henti-hentinya terharu oleh ribuan kata! Terima kasih semuanya!"
"379.","Chao Hyman","77","2023-01-01","5","Saya pribadi merasa hotel ini lebih baik daripada hotel lain seperti Bulgari, dan juga lebih dekat ke bandara. Stafnya sangat ramah, dan makanan di restoran di sebelah lobi sangat lezat. Pemandangannya menakjubkan, dengan pemandangan laut yang memukau dan angin laut yang sejuk (ciri khas Bali). Setiap kamar memiliki kolam renang infinity pribadi, menawarkan privasi yang tinggi, jadi Anda tidak perlu khawatir tentang kebocoran privasi."
"380.","Ericso Lin","62","2024-01-01","5","Lokasinya unik, setengah lembah dan setengah laut, menawarkan pemandangan menakjubkan pendaratan pesawat tanpa berisik. Semua staf melayani dengan senyuman, kolam renang di vila mengalir terus-menerus, sehingga tidak kotor. Petugas kebersihannya penuh perhatian, dan staf restorannya hangat dan penuh perhatian. Makanannya juga lezat. Secara keseluruhan, ini hotel yang luar biasa! Saya pasti akan kembali untuk berlibur!"
"381.","Ольга Гершкович","48","2024-01-01","5","Tempat terbaik di dunia. Pelayanan, fasilitas, halaman, taman, dan pemandangan lautnya sungguh luar biasa.

Aroma minyak esensial yang luar biasa, musik yang indah, keheningan, dan kicauan burung, serta makanan sehat tersedia berdasarkan permintaan. Suasananya dirancang dengan cermat untuk relaksasi dan harmoni. Pengalaman yang luar biasa. Terima kasih kepada seluruh staf dan mereka yang telah menciptakan tempat yang begitu indah."
"382.","JO SUN NAM JA","26","2024-01-01","5","Siapa pun yang memberi peringkat rendah mungkin mata-mata dari resor terdekat.

Saya pasti akan kembali. Terima kasih, semuanya di Raffles Bali. *aditya: Kami menerima layanan terbaik. Berkat Anda, perjalanan kami menjadi contoh yang cemerlang. Kami akan mengingat Anda atas perhatian Anda sampai akhir, dan kami akan sangat berterima kasih bahkan saat kami kembali ke Korea!"
