"1.","Samit Ambaram","9","2025-12-01","5","Our stay at Sofitel Nusa Dua was absolutely exceptional from start to finish. The resort exudes pure luxury, with an elegant atmosphere that immediately makes you feel relaxed and pampered. Every corner of the property is immaculate — from the lush tropical gardens to the sparkling pools and beautifully designed rooms. The staff service was outstanding, and we’d love to give special thanks to Pande, our housekeeper, who kept our room spotless every single day and always greeted us with a warm smile. His attention to detail and friendliness made our stay even more comfortable. We also want to highlight Andika from the restaurant team, who went above and beyond to make sure our breakfasts and meals met all our expectations. The food was consistently delicious, and Andika’s attentive service made every dining experience a pleasure. The resort’s location right by the beach is another major plus — it’s peaceful, clean, and perfect for morning walks or sunset views. There are plenty of dining options, from international buffets to authentic local cuisine, so there’s something for everyone to enjoy without ever needing to leave the resort. Overall, Sofitel Nusa Dua delivers everything you could hope for in a five-star getaway — luxury, comfort, and world-class service. We left feeling refreshed and already planning our next visit. Highly recommended! 🌴✨"
"2.","Jasmin H","239","2025-12-25","5","We stayed at Sofitel Nusa Dua for several days in November and had a wonderful experience from start to finish. The welcome was exceptional. As Platinum members, we were received at Club Millésime, where we could check in in a calm and comfortable setting while enjoying a drink. The hotel truly offers excellent benefits for Accor members. We received a complimentary room upgrade to a room with a private pool and a beautiful terrace, which we thoroughly enjoyed. There were absolutely no issues with insects or pests. The room was spacious and extremely clean, and we were welcomed with delicious snacks upon arrival. Housekeeping was spotless every single day. Club Millésime is the perfect place to fully unwind. Snacks are available throughout the day, and what truly impressed us was that during check-in we were asked about dietary restrictions. These were genuinely taken into account: the staff immediately knew our dietary needs upon entering the club without us having to remind them, and at times they even prepared custom-made snacks when nothing else was suitable. The breakfast menu in the club itself felt a bit limited, which is why we chose to have breakfast in the main restaurant instead. Dining at Kwee Zeen Restaurant was fantastic, with a wide variety of dishes ranging from Western to Indonesian and Indian cuisine. The restaurant was also very clean. The swimming pools were well maintained and clean, with staff available to offer towels. However, we did feel that there could have been more sun loungers available, especially in the afternoon when it became quite challenging to find a spot. The hotel is located directly on the beach, where sunbeds and towels are also provided. There were plenty of complimentary daily activities, such as sports, as well as paid activities like banana leaf folding and fruit carving. The paid activities were incredibly fun, and since it was just the two of us, we received full personal attention from the staff (sorry guys, we forgot your names!). Lastly, a very special shoutout to the staff who made my birthday truly unforgettable. From morning until dinner, I was completely spoiled. In the morning, during our banana leaf folding activity, the staff suddenly appeared singing with a cake and balloons. In the evening, Yuli and Febri made the night unforgettable by arriving singing with a birthday cake during dinner. It is worth noting that there is not much to do in the immediate surroundings of the hotel. This is truly a destination to relax and unwind. Do not expect to walk outside and find many restaurants or shops nearby. That said, ordering food and other items via Grab is very easy and convenient. The next time we are in Bali, we will definitely be staying with you again."

Plenty of good food options, great room service, tailor to any requests you have. Organised taxis when required to go anywhere. Big shout-out to Sri who served us at breakfast most mornings! We always had a complicated a-la-carte order, but she made it happen every day, and remembered our order for the next day! She was super friendly and was so professional, you can tell she loves what she does. 10/10 for Sri 👏 Also the massage on the beach is also a great addition!"
"4.","jeroen andriessen","11","2025-12-11","5","Fantastic resort. Grand set up. The whole plays breathes luxury. Multiples pools, a number of eateries. Excellent quality food. Beautiful spot on the beach. Very large light well equipped rooms. Lovely view of looking the compound and the sea. Great fitness, nicely air conditioned, lot of equipment. The breakfast is simply overwhelming., Traditional, Asian, Indian cuisine all available. One of the highlights is there fresh juice & veggie bar where your choice of drink is freshly pressed. This resort offers all that you expect from a very luxurious place, and more. Their greatest acid however, is their staff. All of them are really geared towards excellent service to the clients. Welcoming, courteous, communicative. they are all excellent representatives of this resort, they’re all very good hosts in their own right. Shining example Mira, Mia and Michelle who amongst other things, attend to all your breakfast / lunch / dinner needs with a big big smile.It is simply great to see their lovely smile every morning and enjoy their great service to make your day as good as possible. They really anticipate on your needs and wishes. As if they read your mind. Nusa Dua Is in fact whole string of hotels and resorts. This, no doubt has to be one of the absolute better ones. Highly recommended."
"5.","renee har","3","2025-12-01","5","The staff at Bali Sofitel have been consistent in high quality service. I love that all staff greet and welcome us when we walk past any staff member. I can also see the friendly service thy go above and beyond to accommodate our needs. What I found extra special as a consumer that has come back three years in a row was the hospitality. From the entrance we are greeted with a bracelet that wishes all staff prosperity. All these small details makes the difference. This time around on our third year we came to a medical conference to Sofitel. The food was to be commended. Morning tea was provided at 930am and had the most variety of food and drinks. Conference ending there was still never ending top up on food and beverages when the conference ended.I found that quite special, having been to other conferences around other hotels. Sofitel Bali hotel was by far the best catering for food. During the 6 days of stay we had moved rooms three and from the management I put my hat down to them. I commend them for exceptional service in service delivery. I had the honour of meeting the Director of rooms during the meet and greet for Accor members that happens weekly. Amy is to be mentioned as she has an amazing team under her. Her commitment and dedication is seen through her team."
"6.","Jasper Ng","2","2025-12-01","5","We had an amazing stay, and a huge part of that was thanks to our servers, Sri and Angga. They were incredibly accommodating, attentive, and always made sure we had everything we needed throughout our stay. Their warmth and professionalism truly made the experience feel special. The room itself was also impressive — spacious at 88 sqm, beautifully designed, and very comfortable. We especially loved the private pool, which was surprisingly large and perfect for relaxing anytime of the day. Overall, everything exceeded our expectations. Highly recommended!"
"7.","Phu Diep","271","2025-12-01","5","Fantastic choice for families and anyone looking for a luxurious beachfront escape. The pool-access rooms (my room is 1001) are outstanding, offering direct entry to beautiful, well-maintained pools that make every morning feel like a holiday. The resort also shines in its activities for kids, with a fun, safe, and creative program that keeps children excited and engaged. They have the kids journey to achieve and receive the gift at the end Its location right on the beach is unbeatable—just a few steps from coral sand, calm waves, and stunning sunrise views. The service is consistently warm and friendly, from check-in to housekeeping, making the entire stay feel genuinely cared for. The club lounge is another highlight, with a relaxed atmosphere, attentive staff, and great food and drinks throughout the day."
"8.","Devy Liem","15","2025-12-18","3","Firstly, if its not for accor plus stay benefit (itself has been nerfed) I will not consider paying for the room rate The breakfast: delicious, but underwhelming. International selections were very limited, for example the Japanese section only have MISO SOUP + another protein The hotel: definite wear and tear visible. Room aircon wasnt cold enough, the restaurant is very humid. Mosquitos are also a real issue that i find anywhere anytime, poolside, balcony, restaurant Kids club: 5 star, very friendly, very safe. The nanny service is top notch Staff: very welcoming, accomodating and helpful"
"9.","Chris","1","2025-12-01","4","We enjoyed our week stay at the Sofitel. Staff throughout the stay were extremely pleasant and attentive. The Butler service was of a high standard and all requests taken care of promptly. Thanks to them all. The Villa was well appointed and roomy with a lovely garden and swimming pool. Housekeeping did an excellent job, especially Alit, who did a super job. Breakfast and Club Millesme inclusions were lovely. We especially enjoyed The Cucina restaurant, beautiful food and staff, special thanks to Suci and Githa, who made our dining experience special."
"10.","Lada Muratova","3","2025-12-25","5","During our stay, we enjoyed the Summer BBQ at the beachfront restaurant. The food was excellent, with a great selection of seafood, meats, sides, and desserts. We would especially like to thank Yulyastika for making our evening truly memorable. He went above and beyond, paying attention to every detail - ensuring our glasses were always full, providing fresh plates for the buffet, bringing lemon water and towels for the seafood, and promptly clearing plates so everything felt effortless and enjoyable. His attentive, thoughtful service truly elevated our dining experience."
"11.","Kelwin Adrian Khoven","7","2025-12-01","5","A truly memorable stay from start to finish at Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort. As Platinum members, we felt warmly recognized and valued throughout our entire visit. Upon arrival, we were personally escorted to Club Millésime for a dedicated check-in. Our luggage was handled with the utmost care—the concierge brought everything directly to our room. We were upgraded from a Luxury Room with Resort View to a Luxury Room with Pool Access. They also kindly fulfilled my request for a complimentary birthday cake for my partner, along with welcome amenities and decorations. Breakfast was great, with a peaceful spread at Club Millésime and a more extensive buffet at Kwee Zeen. What really stood out was the staff, every interaction, from the front desk to dining, was warm, professional, and made us feel truly valued."
"12.","Hayden Chapman","5","2025-12-01","5","We stayed at the Sofitel for a week, with 4 others and the ability of the hotel and staff, to ensure that our trip together was exactly what we wanted during our time within the resort. The food was amazing, diverse and always very fresh. The morning buffet, was my favourite and the variety for different cuisines around the world, put it over the top. I tip my hat off to the amazing customer event team under Dian who helped me put together a surprise night for me wife after dinner one night. I can not go past the amazing effort and time that one of the staffers, Asih, put into cleaning and tidying the room! We always came back to the room being spotless, fresh towels, sheets and toiletries when needed. She even went above and beyond in folding any clothes that were dry and left outside on the clothes horse. Thank you to all at the Sofitel, our first week ever in bali and definitely a memorable one."
"13.","Amelie","22","2025-12-01","5","We had the best experience dining here! Our server, Yudi, was absolutely incredible. We came in as a big group of eight with three kids and plenty of special requests, but nothing was ever too much trouble for him. He was patient, attentive, and unbelievably quick, always appearing right when we needed something. The food was fantastic, but Yudi truly made the night memorable. Exceptional service like his is rare these days. He definitely deserves a raise! Highly recommend this place and will absolutely be back."
"14.","Susie F","10","2025-12-25","5","My husband and I had the most relaxing and enjoyable stay here - definitely one of our best holidays ever. The hospitality was exceptional from start to finish. Huge thanks to our amazing butlers Yuli, Edi, Darwin, Hendrik, and attendant Lanang for going above and beyond every day. Also grateful to Novi from the fitness centre, who kindly stayed back to help me set up the cardio room, and to Sinta, Adiana, Yulyastika and many more staff for their warm and attentive service. Sorry we didn’t catch all their names. We loved our pool villa, the beautiful Club Millésime, and the great restaurants throughout the resort. Everything was immaculate, relaxing, and thoughtfully done. Highly recommend - we’re already planning our return!"
"15.","Yana Skalski","8","2025-12-25","3","Property is nice, with large pools and plenty of loungers. Food is generally good, with the exception of the kids menu, so we ended up sharing with our daughter from the a la carte, not a big deal. We stayed in off-season, so it was not particularly busy, which made the failures in service all the more disappointing. To name a few: we were made to wait for a very long time in the “welcome area” before we could even approach the check-in counters, only to be told our rooms weren’t ready. Although it was already past the check in time, we agreed to wait (what choice did we have?), and asked if it was possible to get rooms on a high floor to avoid having upstairs neighbors. The hotel was not busy at all, so we thought this was a simple request. However, this required another 20 minutes of “checking”, and yielded no clear answer. Instead, we were offered lunch. This seemed nice until we got to the nearly empty restaurant, where it took at least 30 minutes for the servers to put in our food order, and another hour for it to arrive. Again, empty restaurant, plenty of staff, just extreme disorganisation. The room saga continued afterwards - won’t bore you with details, but management ended up involved for an issue that should have easily been sorted by staff. Unfortunately, our first day experience was representative of the service during our whole stay. The staff smile a lot, but seem very poorly trained and unable to answer basic questions. Every issue is chalked up to “miscommunication”, even if it is clear that the issue is on their end. Management seems aware and uninterested in addressing this. It was an ok experience overall, but not one we’re in a hurry to repeat."
"16.","Mega P B","27","2025-12-01","5","I had an unforgettable stay at Sofitel Nusa Dua, and I truly want to highlight how amazing the team was throughout my visit. From the moment I arrived, Jati at the Front Desk welcomed me with genuine warmth. He was incredibly polite, attentive to every detail, and always greeted me with a smile. His service really set the tone for my entire stay. Before my arrival, Najla from the Concierge team had already reached out to help organize my visit. When I mentioned that this trip was for my early birthday, she coordinated everything so beautifully—including arranging a surprise birthday cake in my room. She even upgraded my room to the next level, which made the experience even more special. Her professionalism and personal touch truly elevated my stay. A big appreciation also goes to Oka from Guest Experience, along with the wonderful lady who personally delivered my birthday cake. They went above and beyond by arranging my birthday cake voucher even though I booked it just one day before (it normally requires at least two days’ notice). Their dedication and effort made me feel genuinely celebrated. Overall, the service, hospitality, and attention to detail were exceptional. Thank you to the whole Sofitel Nusa Dua team for making this stay one to remember. I will definitely return!"
"17.","Thu Yain","81","2025-12-25","2","I do not understand the good reviews. Yes, service is superficially good mostly. But, beyond that, meh. Though the club staff seems to be a tad more accommodating and superb. Welcome amenities are just a basket of fruits. Asked for late check out and really bad with the response. Also, rooms are aging. Rusty rails. We walked along the beach and can see other hotels’ pools seem better and cleaner. Nusa Dua is far away from a lot of places, so be sure to get a driver or a car."
"18.","Ankit Raghuwanshi","8","2025-12-18","5","I recently stayed at Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort, and overall it was a wonderful and relaxing experience. The property is huge, beautifully designed, and has a premium feel from the moment you arrive. 👍 Good Points • Great stay overall The resort has a peaceful, luxurious ambience and offers plenty of space to unwind. The lush landscaping and elegant interior design add to the experience. • Rooms are big and spacious The rooms are very comfortable, well-designed, and generously sized — perfect for a relaxing holiday. The bathrooms are also large and premium. • Massive pool with a great pool bar The pool area is one of the highlights. It’s huge, beautifully maintained, and offers plenty of seating. The pool bar is excellent, with good drinks and a fun atmosphere — especially enjoyable in the evening. • Direct access to the beach The convenience of walking straight from the resort to the beach is fantastic. The beachfront area is clean, scenic, and perfect for sunrise walks. ⸻ 👎 Things That Could Improve • Breakfast area feels messy and overcrowded The breakfast buffet has a great variety, but the crowd management needs improvement. There were too many people at the same time, making the experience feel chaotic. • Item positioning can be improved Some food stations are placed awkwardly, causing crowd buildup. A better layout and flow would make breakfast much smoother. • Possibly due to the resort being very large It seems the high number of guests contributes to the breakfast rush and overall morning chaos. ⸻ Overall A lovely resort with spacious rooms, incredible pools, and direct beach access. The stay was very enjoyable, but the breakfast experience could be improved with better organization and flow. Still, a great place to relax in Nusa Dua — and I would happily return!"
"19.","Kyle","172","2025-12-18","5","This hotel is absolutely stunning from inside to outside. The rooms are nice and spacious and very clean. The staff from reception to all good and beverage are amazing, extremely friendly and happy. The food at the restaurants was incredible and had a large selection. Can not fault any aspect of the hotel and we look forward to coming back and staying again in the future."
"20.","Josh Parnaby","31","2025-12-01","5","My partner and I stayed here a few weeks ago and were absolutely blown away. Everything was perfect—from the beautiful, spacious room to the incredibly friendly and attentive staff. The food was amazing, and we loved spending time at the beach, the pool bar, and the spa & gym. Club Millésime was a standout highlight, offering exceptional service and a private lounge that made our stay feel even more special. Truly an unforgettable experience—highly recommended!"
"21.","Ehsan Panahi","12","2025-11-01","5","Our recent stay at Sofitel Nusa Dua was nothing short of sublime. The resort combines elegant design, immaculate grounds, and thoughtful amenities to create a calm, luxurious atmosphere that perfectly suits a family getaway. Every corner of the property felt carefully maintained, and the attention to detail in the room upkeep made coming back each day a genuine pleasure. Service across the resort was consistently warm, professional, and unobtrusive. Meals were beautifully presented and delicious; the resort’s restaurants — including Toya and Kwee Zeen — offer varied, high-quality dining experiences. We didn’t get a chance to try Cucina on this trip - another option for guests for a varied dining experience. Room service was excellent, prompt, and presented with care. The spa experience at SoSpa delivered expert, restorative treatments in a serene setting that left us relaxed and refreshed. The resort’s family facilities are outstanding: the daycare team were warm and professional, the staff across children’s programs were engaging, and the children’s activities were imaginative and well run. The gym facilities boast adequate training equipment, complete with sauna and steam rooms. Special acknowledgment With particular gratitude to three outstanding team members whose service made our visit memorable: • Gede Ame — exemplary daily room care and service, delivered with professionalism and warmth. • Yulyastika — attentive and gracious server at Toya, elevating our dining experience with impeccable timing and genuine hospitality. • Maya — exceptional therapist at SoSpa, whose skill and calming presence made the treatment deeply restorative."
"22.","김민영","2","2025-12-04","5","I truly love the Sofitel brand, and my recent stay at Sofitel Bali was especially exceptional. Everyone was so kind, and I was deeply impressed by the hotel facilities, the beach, the kids club, and the food. In particular, having a Korean-speaking butler, Robert, made communication effortless. Thanks to him, I now feel confident that even my parents—who are not comfortable with English—could stay at Sofitel on their own without any issues. I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to Hendrik for taking such good care of us throughout our stay. If we visit Bali again, Sofitel Nusa Dua will definitely be our choice once more. Thank you for a wonderful stay."
"23.","Jo","5","2025-12-01","5","Our recent stay at the Sofitel was exceptional! The faultless customer service by all personnel made us feel special and welcomed guests. From the initial email as they expected us right till the final correspondence after we'd returned home, the information was clear and each query responded to promptly. We make special mention of Najla, Timothy and Widya, for providing such reassurance. What a lovely surprise to be greeted with a birthday welcome when we checked into our room. The hospitality shown by the staff, especially at the Kwee Zeen Restaurant, ensured each of dining experiences over the week was memorable. Sincere compliments to the chefs for delicious meals prepared with a French flare incorporating Balinese flavours. We especially appreciated the attentiveness of 2 young servers, Sinta and Miko. They anticipated and met our every need with a smile, including at busy times. It wasn't surprising when Sinta was promoted to a higher role on an evening when a regular staff member was absent. Wishing her good luck as she progresses in her studies. Thank you Sofitel for our week of relaxation in luxury."
"24.","George Dumitrescu","22","2025-12-01","5","Our stay at Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort was absolutely amazing! Everything was perfect – from the spotless rooms and cozy beds to the outstanding service from the staff. The pools are stunning, the private beach is calm and beautifully maintained, and the breakfast buffet is one of the best we’ve ever had, with a huge selection of international dishes. The tropical gardens and peaceful atmosphere make it the perfect place to relax and unwind. Highly recommended for anyone looking for true luxury in Bali! 🌴✨"
"25.","Ben Daly","4","2025-12-01","5","We had an awesome family stay at Sofitel Nusa Dua Bali. The resort is beautiful, the pools are perfect for the kids, and everything is really well looked after. It’s the kind of place where you can actually switch off and enjoy some proper family time. Huge shoutout to Diah and Bagus who took such great care of us. They were incredibly friendly, always made the kids feel special, and genuinely went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed. Their service really made our stay unforgettable. Highly recommend Sofitel Nusa Dua for families—couldn’t have asked for a better holiday. We’ll definitely be back!"
"26.","Fi63an126er1a","13","2025-12-18","5","Great service, ambiance and atmosphere. The room quality is nice, and the whole resort and the close access to the beach is a very big plus. Food items are very good, and an extra shout out to our waiter, Hendra for providing a quality service. Thank you!!"
"27.","Denise Brooks","33","2025-12-01","4","The check in process was quite slow, with lots of people waiting in comfortable chairs. Suana, our bell man, made us feel very welcome and safe when he took us to our room. We were advised at check out to take a seat also but, with no bill to pay because we paid as we went, I was not about to take a seat and wait just to say goodbye. Otherwise the crew at the resort were absolutely fabulous. The room was comfortable and spacious, but I'd think the bed may be due for replacement mattress. We had a fabulous time though and would recommend a break at this resort."
"28.","Maram Madan","26","2025-12-01","5","We stayed in 3 hotels and a villa during our visit to Bali, Sofitel was THE BEST! they made our honeymoon extra special the service was excellent specially Liah she made our honeymoon and my birthday set up which was so nice. Food options were okay for a few nights stay and room dining was good. We had the BBQ Night buffet options were kinda limited but it was great ambience with live entertainment. The hotel has its own beach and there are water activities nearby so you'll love it if you're into water activities. The most important is we didn't even spot an ant or any insect in our room unlike other hotels in Bali which is a big perk. The only thing is the location far from Ubud and Seminyak otherwise it would be my go to hotel for my full stay in Bali next time but we'll definitely go back for a few nights if we're back in Bali. Best hospitality."
"29.","Jazz Bir","64","2025-12-01","4","Loved the excellent service and Rivaldo our room attendant was just wonderful. The breakfast was generous and had lots of variety. The staff were friendly and attentive. I booked with incisions and my feedback would be that whilst you are given cocktail vouchers they can only be used at Toya which can be closed due the weather. In addition, you can only use the dinner voucher at two places of which Toya is one and again if it’s closed you have 1 option. The only other option is Kwizeen and they have a very limited range of vegetarian options. I enjoyed using the gym but I’m not giving the full 5 stars on the basis of my feedback."
"30.","Gabriel Braga","72","2025-12-25","5","If you want to be treated like royalty, look no further than the Sofitel Bali. From the moment I arrived, the level of service was unparalleled—it’s clear they pride themselves on excellence. The blend of French luxury and Balinese warmth makes for a truly unique atmosphere. I enjoyed every single minute of my stay; it wasn't just a vacation, it was a world-class experience. If you’re looking for the best time in Bali, this is the right place."
"31.","Priscilla Chrisanita","8","2025-12-01","2","To be honest eventhough the hotel is a five stars hotel unfortunately the service is like 3 stars hotel. Unlike any other five stars hotels in Bali such as kempinski, the ritz carlton hotel, the hyatt regency or andaz when you can find the real luxury experiences with the same price as sofitel At sofitel, the swimming pools alot of them are green in color like mud due to poor maintenance. And every single activities such as bike, kids club you need to pay extra. Breakfast options are just so poor. In kids club there are actually more than 8 staff incharged but still you cannot leave your kids at kids club unless you pay for extra service. So I ended up accompanying the kids and listed the staffs at the kids club gossiping because they have nothing to do! As an accor member myself own a gold member and my husband is a platinum member you will not gonna receive any upgrade! Instead eventhough in your benefit it mentions you will get the best available room, they give you a room facing the parking lot! So if you are expecting a luxury service, think many times to go to sofitel. I guarantee other luxury brand will give you better service! In here is like you are flying with budget airlines where you need to pay extra for anything."
"32.","Valeria Diaz Lopez","2","2025-12-04","5","My friend and I stayed at this hotel, and honestly, it was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. This place is beautiful, and the people are so lovely! The rooms are spacious and modern, and we had an amazing resort view. Amenities were amazing, service was 10/10, and everything was clean and kept tidy. If you want to stay somewhere in Bali, book here!! You will not regret it!"
"33.","Natalia","6","2025-11-01","5","Our stay at the Sofitel Hotel in Nusa Dua was absolutely amazing from start to finish. The staff were incredibly accommodating and genuinely friendly, always going above and beyond to make us feel welcome and cared for. The facilities were exceptional, from the beautiful pool area to the club lounge, everything exceeded our expectations. The dining experiences were just as impressive, with every restaurant offering delicious, beautifully presented food. A special mention goes to Kwee Zen and the wonderful staff member Ria, who made our meals even more memorable. She was so attentive, warm, and always ready with fantastic food recommendations, truly a standout part of our stay."
"34.","Andry Pramana","8","2025-11-01","5","Exceptional Experience at Sofitel Bali I recently had the pleasure of staying at Sofitel Bali, and I must say, it was truly unforgettable. Rai, who oversees the Club Lounge and Butler team, deserves special mention for delivering outstanding service that exceeded my expectations. From the moment I arrived, the hospitality was warm and welcoming. The room was immaculately clean, with a stunning view that was simply breathtaking. The amenities were top-notch, and the food served in the lounge was delicious and expertly prepared. Rai's team went above and beyond to ensure my stay was seamless and enjoyable. Their attention to detail, proactive approach, and warm smiles made me feel like royalty. I would highly recommend Sofitel Bali to anyone looking for a luxurious and memorable experience. Special thanks to Rai and the entire team for making my stay so special We will come back!"
"35.","Z O","28","2025-11-01","3","Good points - well maintained and overall stunning facade and facilities Downers This is our 3rd sofitel this year. The other 2 being siem reap and Phnom Penh. Sofitel Bali lacks a certain personal touch the other 2 (esp siem reap) managed to achieve. The stuff smile at you, but you get the feeling it is all just a show. At siem reap and Phnom Penh, on check in we were personally greeted by their general manager. By day 2, we were being addressed by name even by stuff who we have not interacted with before. Siem reap stuff genuinely seem like they want to serve you, we accidentally brought some sand into your room once and within 1min of calling the front desk, 2 attendants were at our doorstep and they really couldn't wait to help us clean. When we checked out and boarded the taxi to the airport, the entire team lined up at the foyer to wave us good bye. Granted sofitel Bali is simply a much larger establishment. Perhaps with so many guests, no one is truly special. In siem reap, we always felt welcomed in the club lounge. We felt like it is a place to enter, have a sit on a sofa, grab a cold drink and be in absolute peace. Bali club lounge always felt crowded. There's always someone rushing forward to grab the food. High tea was a nice touch but the lounge is fully packed. Felt like you are in a crowded restaurant more than a 5star lounge. Cocktail hours are even more packed. Plus there is a policy for no kids during cocktail hours. We are a family for 2 with our 1year old. We were told we can leave him at the kids club, but how could you expect a parent to leave their 1year old behind. The workaround then is to have 1 parent enter the lounge a few mins before closure to order the drinks and take the food, only for the other parent to bring the kid in the minute cocktail hour ends. But our kid gets tired by the time cocktail hour ended. So we never truly got to enjoy it. I have been to other hotels with a similar no kid policy, but their workaround was to have a separate sitting area for families and it worked out really well. As stated above, lounge was packed all the time, thus I'm assuming many people are ALL platinum. Perhaps that was why we were also basically not given a room upgrade. In the other 2 sofitels, we were upgraded to the junior suite for free. I'll likely be giving the sofitel brand name another chance at Hanoi next year, if they disappoint too it might be time to jump away from Accor"
"36.","shania nadine","4","2025-11-01","5","Went here for our honeymoon and absolutely loved it! We had dinner at Cucina and the food was amazing. Breakfast at Kwee Zeen was also great with plenty of options. We really enjoyed the pools, the private beach access, and how clean and well-maintained everything was. The staff were all friendly and welcoming. The location is perfect too (just a short walk to Bali Collection). We had such a wonderful stay and can’t wait to come back!"

He speaks Korean fluently and consistently provided warm, thoughtful, and professional assistance throughout our stay. No matter the situation, he was always kind, attentive, and ready to help. Thanks to Robert, our honeymoon felt incredibly comfortable, stress-free, and full of happy moments. We would like to express our sincere thanks to Robert for making our honeymoon so special. We were sorry that we couldn’t meet him at check-out, but we hope to see him again when we return to Sofitel for another vacation after working hard and saving up."
"38.","SKIN BY STELLA","3","2025-11-01","5","We recently stayed at Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort, and I honestly can’t express enough how beautiful and kind the staff were throughout our entire stay. We felt so blessed from the moment we arrived. The food, service, pool, and drinks were all absolutely amazing — everything exceeded our expectations. A very special mention to our butler, Diah, who truly made our stay incredible. Every morning, she came to see us at breakfast to make sure we had everything we needed for the day and that all our bookings were taken care of. Her warm personality and exceptional service made us feel so well looked after. We highly recommend Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua to anyone looking for a luxurious and unforgettable getaway. We can’t wait to come back!"
"39.","Phusit Makmangme","128","2025-11-01","5","This resort is magnificent. The view is so stunning, and the overall property is truly five-star. Unluckily that I'm only here to attend the meeting, so I didn't get to fully enjoy the pools or the beautiful beach. The meeting facilities and business service were excellent, but the setting makes you instantly want to switch to vacation mode! Next time, I will definitely spend time for this hotel for a proper holiday. Highly recommended for both business and leisure!"
"40.","Melissa Winship","13","2025-12-25","5","Stayed at the Sofitel Nusa Dua Garden Villa for 2 nights. The room was maintained to an exceptionally high standard and we were very well looked after by our butler Robert. Robert was very attentive, very good at helping us make dinner reservations, would schedule when housekeeping would come to our villa and continued to look after us even after check out whilst we stayed at the villa for the morning. Would highly recommend staying at the Sofitel."
"41.","molly yvonne","7","2025-11-01","5","Every single staff member went above and beyond to make our stay unforgettable. The concierge was incredible — they handled all our activity and dinning bookings effortlessly over WhatsApp, which made everything so convenient. The wait staff were extremely attentive, and to my surprise, they even left a complimentary birthday cake in our room upon check-in because it happened to be my birthday that day — such a thoughtful touch! We also booked a “Romantic Beach Dinner” for my partner and me, and the team absolutely exceeded expectations. They had fresh flowers everywhere, even printed and framed one of our photos to display on the table, and the whole setup was stunning. It honestly felt like something out of a movie — they even managed to flatter us both at the same time, haha! Truly an incredible experience — highly recommend this hotel for anyone who values amazing service and attention to detail and at an incredible price point. 🌸"
"42.","Carmen Cheung","12","2025-10-01","5","I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience in Sofitel. This has to be one of the best accommodations I've stayed in within Bali. From the moment I arrived, the service had been impeccable. The staff are all friendly and they really look after you. My partner was unwell just before we arrived, and we were able to get a nurse to see him in our room. The rooms are clean, and they also provided a lot of complimentary amenities. They have so many different restaurant options, bar options and even their own private beach. We did not even need to leave the resort during our stay because they had everything. I also want to give a special shoutout to Gede Ame for going above and beyond. He was so nice, did a great job with our room clean, gave us many other recommendations in Bali during our vacation. Our overall experience here has been so fantastic, I will definitely be coming back."
"43.","Kit Lan Chan","1","2025-12-25","5","We had a wonderful holiday at Sofitel in mid-December, and the restaurant service was unexpectedly five-star.

We will definitely come back again!"
"44.","Wanasak Wanapanis","20","2025-12-01","5","We had a truly memorable stay at Sofitel Bali. The staff are well-trained, attentive, and genuinely friendly. Special thanks to Lestari at the Club Lounge check-in for her warm hospitality, Karsana who took great care of us during the Chic Picnic Dinner for our 3rd anniversary, and Tri, the Club Lounge Manager, whom we met during the All Reunion Week. We mentioned to Tri that we got engaged here at the hotel, and the next day we were surprised with a beautifully decorated room complete with a cake and thoughtful touches. It made our stay even more special! Thank you again, Tri, and the Sofitel Bali team for such an unforgettable experience. We will definitely return next year to celebrate our 4th anniversary!"
"45.","Scott Reid","54","2025-11-01","5","Our family has just returned from the most incredible stay at the Sofitel Nusa Dua. The lobby is breathtaking; we were greeted with the warmest welcome. The resort itself is a tropical dream. The sprawling lagoon-style pools are magnificent, and our child spent countless happy hours splashing and swimming. The grounds are immaculately manicured, and the direct access to the pristine Nusa Dua beach. Our room was spacious, beautifully decorated, and offered a private plunge pool. The housekeeping staff did a phenomenal job, ensuring our space was always pristine. The dining experience at Cucina Restaurant was outstanding. What truly sets the Sofitel Nusa Dua apart, however, is its incredible staff. Every single team member we encountered greeted us with a genuine smile and went above and beyond to make our stay special. We cannot recommend the Sofitel Nusa Dua highly enough for any family seeking a luxurious, relaxing, and truly memorable getaway. Thank you for giving our family the most wonderful holiday!"
"46.","Richard Aschberger","204","2025-11-01","5","Very happy with the hotel, stayed 3 full weeks there in a lagoon pool access room. The lounge is good, very friendly staff, rooms are modern and clean and the restaurants are also good. Almost every day there is a theme-evening or buffet at obe of the restaurants. Its a family resort but as solo traveller I can say its very good too. Lots of space, nice beach. I wil travel there again, its a better quality than the Mövenpick Jimbaran and much quiter in the night as there is not a busy street full of scooters 😄."
"47.","Kay Montgomery","143","2025-11-01","5","Rooms were cleaned well. Some had a mold smell but the staff can accommodate you if you get a room like that. Some room balconies are located not towards the beach but still nice. The beds are huge and so comfortable. The bathroom area is spacious and comfortable as well. There is so much food and luxury at Sofitel there isn't much to complain about. The staff and their professional and accompanying service is A+. I APPRECIATED THEM! We were a large group celebrating my friends 50th birthday. The Sunday brunch is a MUST if you love food like me! The staff again excellent and so down to earth. The pool area was always clean. The beach is terrible. That is my only complaint since I love to be in beach water. The temple experience and cultural heritage center was super cool to experience. We learned a lot. Cover up if you go. And hide any items that can be snatched up from the monkeys. The Koral restaurant is amazing to dine. The spas are also very friendly and relaxing to try out. THE INFAMOUS SWING!! DO IT!! Its breathtaking! Otherwise, the hotel could use more adult nightly entertainment as well but you will keep busy during the day anyway. I love this resort and would definitely recommend it. Its top tier balling at every level. The McDonald's even delivered to the resort one night. That was so cool! Looking forward to returning one day. VISIT BALI"
"48.","Craig Smith","50","2025-12-01","5","My wife and I stayed for our wedding anniversary - we were treated like Royalty - I have never stayed somewhere so welcoming and hospitable - the staff were extremely friendly and attentive, all of them even just in passing. The food was next level great, my wife I didn't want to leave the resort. The prices were reasonable what the quality. This resort had everything, every activity, a spa, great gym, beach area. The only downside if any was the amount of people smoking, people would smoke in the pool, outside breakfast, on the pathway you couldn't escape it and it was a real downside. Maybe a dedicated smoking area away from the rooms / pools and staff enforcement would make it better. With that said we will easily return to the Sofitel Nusa Dua Bali."
"49.","Ann Wallace","14","2025-12-01","5","This resort is a private paradise in itself. The grounds leading up to the resort is well maintained including the property. The decor and rooms are eloquently designed. The resort is spacious and impressive. The room, bathroom and balcony are spacious. The pool area was amazing. And the beach was also nice. It comes with all that you need. The food was great. And overall the staff were very polite, attentive and friendly."
"50.","Quan Truong","142","2025-12-11","5","Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort: A Delightful Family Haven with Tropical Charm Fresh off a memorable week at the Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort, I'm happy to report it delivered a fantastic family escape—especially for parents with a young explorer like our energetic 6-year-old. Perched directly on Nusa Dua's powdery white sands, the resort blends sophisticated French flair with authentic Balinese serenity, from its verdant gardens to the gentle sea breezes. It's an ideal spot for creating carefree memories without venturing far, and we'd happily go back for more. The rooms stood out as a true comfort zone. We opted for a family suite that's generously sized and cleverly laid out, featuring a plush king bed for the adults and a cozy nook with a pull-out bed perfect for our little one. High-thread-count linens, a deep soaking tub, and those luxurious Molton Brown bath products made it feel like a treat every time we stepped inside. The private balcony, with its garden views, was our go-to for bedtime stories under the stars—pure magic for a 6-year-old's imagination. Cleanliness, however, left a bit to be desired in spots. The common areas were spotless and inviting, but our room showed some wear: a smudge here, a forgotten towel there, and once, a stray leaf from the gardens that housekeeping overlooked. It's minor in the grand scheme, but for a luxury resort, we expected that flawless finish. The team was quick to respond with a friendly refresh, turning it into a non-issue. On the brighter side, the food was an absolute triumph. The on-site dining options spoiled us with variety and quality—think vibrant buffets at Kwee Zeen by the beach, loaded with fresh Balinese satays, grilled seafood, and kid-friendly gems like buttery noodles and fruit skewers. Our 6-year-old devoured the build-your-own pancake bar at breakfast, stacking on chocolate chips and bananas with glee, while we savored the elevated flavors of the Italian trattoria Bene, where handmade pastas and gelato stole the show. It was flavorful, fresh, and fuss-free—ideal for keeping everyone happy. What really sealed the deal for us was the kid-centric fun. The Little Sofitel Kids' Club was a godsend for our 6-year-old, offering age-appropriate adventures like making colorful Balinese masks, simple cooking classes (hello, mini fruit salads!), and scavenger hunts that had him scampering through the grounds like Indiana Jones. The staff's warm, attentive energy made drop-offs easy and pick-ups full of excited recaps. And the pools? A watery wonderland. The main lagoon pool cascades into shallower, gentler sections just right for a 6-year-old to splash and float safely, complete with a fun slide and colorful inflatables. We lounged on the family-friendly edges while he built sandcastles nearby—bliss for parents and pure joy for kids. All in all, this resort is well worth a visit for families craving that sweet spot of luxury and playfulness. The exceptional rooms, mouthwatering meals, and tailored activities for little ones eclipse the housekeeping quirks. Book it for your next Bali jaunt—you won't regret it. Rating: 4.5/5 stars."
"51.","Steve Bennett","31","2025-11-01","4","Overall we enjoyed our stay and due to my Accor + Explorer memberships we were provided a room upgrade to a Pool access room , which was fantastic. We were disappointed on the food and cocktail selections from the Pool Bar and the food from the Toya Bar on the beach front. We were invited to an Accor member drinks one evening and spoke with the Food and Beverage Manager (2 In Charge) and provided our feedback on our recent stay in the Padma resort in Legian. The food and drinks selection at the Padma was great with many options. We provided one example from the Sofitel Pool bar of the Calamari Balls, which we had one day and they were like hard dry breadcrumb balls. We suggested that the Sofitel review their menus and add better snack selections, like Chicken wings, Satay sticks, Hamburger sliders and better hand made chips etc. We had dinner one night at the Toya bar, with Fish and Ribs. The ribs were tender but lacked flavour. Please review these menus and have senior staff or guests try out new menus to improve customers experience. Another item was Shade around the main pool. There is generally only one row of umbrellas on the 2nd row of sun lounges. The first row is in the water, have no umbrellas and hardly anyone uses them, as it is too hot to stay in the sun for too long. More umbrellas need to be added, so more guests can have shade on the lounges. We are returning in March April 2026 and hope to see the Sofitel address ours and likely other customers feedback."
"52.","Kylee Osborne","21","2025-12-11","5","Sofitel Nusa Dua is a beautiful experience - from the moment we arrived - the upgrade,the special touches during our stay until the moment we left. The place is big and you never felt like the resort was crowded - the buffet breakfast is pretty amazing with so much to choose from and set up like little deli's. The beachfront is stunning, restaurants, massage and water sports all handy. I don't think you could can go wrong with a stay at Sofitel"
"53.","Mark Pratt","69","2025-12-01","5","After 30 years from our last visit to this once far away resort location we returned for a quick 3 night break before heading to Seminyak. What a welcoming surprise we arrived at the Sofitel and from the moment we arrived it was like we were family, the staff are amazing, the facilities are next level and the pool is so big and so clean, we had no reason to leave the resort over the 3 days and they catered to our every need. The restaurants were amazing and special mention to the lovely waitress Suci in the Italian restaurant Cuccina."
"54.","Bahari Haron","219","2025-12-11","5","Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua made a strong impression from the start. I loved the welcome gift of the Sofitel-logo bracelet for the whole family. As a Platinum member, I was upgraded to a pool access room and checked in at the club lounge with a Coco Pandan drink, snacks and cold towels. The room had a fruit basket and cake for our occasion, and the extra bed was already set up as requested. The resort looks fresh and modern on the outside. Service across our three nights was consistently good. Ami from Cucina stood out for being friendly and making sure we had a good dinner. She might be new, but she handled everything well. Breakfast at Kwee Zeen had good variety, and having squirrels running around in the outdoor area kept the kids entertained. The kids club was well equipped and both children enjoyed it. The gym staff were friendly and helpful, which made using the gym a pleasant part of the stay. The club lounge was comfortable for work and quiet time, though cocktail hour felt a bit off because shorts and slippers were accepted. It took away from the lounge atmosphere. The pools were a big part of the stay. Direct pool access from the room was the highlight and made it easy for the family to jump in anytime. The only downside was the kids pool. It looked more aged than the others, with popped tiles, some algae and non-working fountain spouts. Overall, Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua delivered a comfortable family stay, and the pool access room made the trip. I’d return, but I hope the kids pool and lounge dress expectations get tightened up."
"55.","Tracey Brown","29","2025-11-01","5","We recently stayed at the Sofitel Nusa Dua for 6 nights . We stayed in a pool access room that was absolutely beautiful and well appointed & clean . The staff were all excellent and nothing was ever a problem . We had access to the mileseme club and attended the happy 2 hours nightly which offered a wide range of delicious snacks and free flow drinks as well as excellent attentive service . Checkin and check out in the lounge was seamless and the lounge offered a lovely environment that you could relax at anytime . The restaurants within the hotel were fantastic. The food and atmosphere were excellent as was the service. We dined at Toya on the beach and had drinks there a few times. The food , drinks and service were excellent as was the atmosphere. The few nights they had a solo artist he was excellent . The Italian restaurant was also excellent with great service and delicious food . The buffet breakfast was fantastic and offered a huge range of choices that suit everyone and bonus it had great coffee that you could order and have delivered to your table . Whenever we needed a taxi the concierge arranged it for us without a hitch . I highly recommend this hotel if you are wanted a chilled relaxing atmosphere without the hustle and bustle ."

A special thank you to; Della, at Cucina Restaurant, for being such a friendly and attentive waitress. Pilot, for his creative and surprising daily towel animals and meticulous cleaning of our Villa every day. Yuli, from Club Millesime Service, for always taking the time to welcome us. Finally, we wish to acknowledge the Butler team - Rai, Robert, Edi, Yuli and Darwin, who distinguished themselves by creating a memorable birthday celebration, for Teresa, which was the highlight of our holiday.

"57.","Amanda Smith","9","2025-09-01","5","I spent 5 nights here to relax at the end of my Bali trip. It was very peaceful despite being close to capacity. My room was very spacious, modern and clean. The large bed was possibly the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in! My room was ready on arrival. Asih did a fabulous and thorough job as my room attendant. I didn’t use the pool as I preferred to use the lounges on the beach and swim in the ocean. The beach was kept very clean during my stay. All of the resort grounds were very well maintained. The breakfast buffet had a great range but I was a bit disappointed that the majority of it was uncovered and open. A lot of guests appeared sick and were coughing everywhere so I chose to only eat freshly cooked food or things that had just been freshly replenished. I gratefully received a very generous late checkout time, but when my night flight was delayed until the following morning, the charge to stay on for the rest of the night was ridiculously expensive - apparently due to high occupancy. I had to move to a different hotel. Overall, it was a wonderful stay and I would stay there again if I was able to book with a similar promotional/price."
"58.","Elizabeth Calderon","3","2025-11-01","5","Another memorable stay at this beautiful hotel. Food is always delicious and the staff both in the restaurants and facilities is amazing. Special mention to Pande, manager of pool area. Suffering from a knee injury during my stay was a little challenging, but thanks to the consistent care and attention given to us by Pande and his staff, made our stay so much easier. Special mention to Tia, Sinta at Kwee Zeen for their excellent service as well as Mega whom we have known for a number of years and has always been an absolute pleasure to deal with. We are sure to return again."

"60.","nicholas chew","19","2025-11-01","4","Concierge was great in recommending our itinerary for food and making some bookings. Service was top notch from all employees. Pool and beach was great. This could be architectural or a limitation to Bali, or global warming, airflow was almost stagnant throughout the hotel. Except for good aircon in room and reception, we were sweating out of these areas. We expected aircon or some good airflow in the hotel's restaurants at the very least, however was eating in sweat with fans blowing hot air. If Bali's temperature is going to get worse, hotels need to rethink their airflow strategy. Breakfast buffet was average. Japanese and Chinese corner can be 100x better. Dim sum didn't look appetising and teriyaki beef was very dry. Western and Indonesian corner was good. The fresh wok fried noodles was a good touch, however, hit and miss on its seasoning over our 3x breakfast there."
"61.","Gail Jones","14","2025-10-01","4","Hotel overall was fine, not quiet as we expected in the respect of: rooms are dated, worn and in need of a refresh, bathroom (mostly the bath) and furniture mainly, but the products were very nice. Pool area, the floor around the area needs a deep clean as does the pool especially around the waterline. Cracks and missing/loose tiles had been left for sometime or poorly fixed. Lounge beds had peeling paint and lounge cushions were all marked and stained, but towels were readily available and very clean and good quality. Service from the team team around the pool is good and they were all helpful and pleasant. Staff generally are very friendly but we were constantly being asked to review and were given cards in all restaurants including breakfast multiple times, which becomes tiresome. Food was fine, nothing stand out or terrible, but there are plenty of options outside that are wider range, better quality and variety of cost. There was a large wedding taking place - which we were informed about just before our stay... which did impact the beach and pool area during the day and evening over the course of a few days - due to stage/band set up which at times was very loud, but the hotel did set up extra facilities and staff to cope with the extra guests. We enjoyed our holiday but would not stay at this resort again, there is a lot of choice in Bali and for the price range we have stayed in better."
"62.","PY W","25","2025-11-01","1","We are currently staying at Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua and honestly, this has been one of the most disappointing hotel experiences we’ve ever had especially from a property that claims to be 5-star. We booked two rooms under our loyalty membership, expecting comfort and quality service. Instead, from the moment we checked in, the experience has been shocking. When we entered our room, the drawer was completely empty not even basic amenities like tea bags. We had to call just to request those. Then things got worse. When I took a shower, I found blood stains in the shower and near the sink. I tried to overlook it and clean it myself, but later, when I went to bed, I found more blood marks on the bed sheets. Absolutely unacceptable. For a 5-star hotel, this level of hygiene is beyond disgusting. We immediately contacted guest services, who said the manager would call us back within 5 minutes but no one did. After I called again, all they said was that someone would come to change the sheets. When the manager finally arrived, he crossed his arms and spoke to me in a dismissive manner, as if I was the problem. That kind of attitude is unprofessional and completely disrespectful. We are paying for 4 nights across 2 rooms, and this is what we get blood stains, poor service, and a manager who doesn’t seem to care. This place does not deserve its 5-star rating. The staff clearly need proper training in hygiene, customer service, and basic hospitality. We are writing this review while still staying here because that’s how upset and angry we are. What a disappointment from a brand we used to trust."

I especially want to mention Mr. WIKANTARA, who provided truly 5-star service, friendly, and always ensuring that guests had the best experience possible. Overall, it was a memorable stay with outstanding hospitality from all the staff. I would highly recommend Sofitel Nusa Dua to anyone looking for a luxurious and relaxing getaway in Bali."
"65.","T Tan","36","2025-12-11","4","Stayed with family in a poolside suite. We've been to Bali many times before, and we would rate Sofitel's beachfront and suitability for kids among the best. Suggested areas for improvement: - Very long check-in (half hour wait queuing at reception) - We found the F&B disappointing (e.g. Breakfast: disintegrated dim sum; Bali coffee that tasted burnt, like the machine was not cleaned properly; lack of queue management. And Toya Bar felt as if the food was prepared by staff who were inexperienced in western cuisine) - Among the bikes for hire, it would have been good to have bikes suitable for young kids to ride with us along the boardwalk."

We were celebrating our honeymoon, and the resort went above and beyond to make it unforgettable. Upon check-in, we were graciously upgraded to one of their stunning villas—an incredible surprise that set the tone for our entire stay. The villa was absolute perfection: spacious, beautifully designed, and incredibly private, with our own pool and a serene tropical ambiance that made every moment feel magical. The service throughout our stay was flawless. Every staff member we encountered greeted us warmly and made us feel genuinely valued and cared for. It’s clear that hospitality at Sofitel is not just a job—it’s a passion. From the sweet honeymoon touches to the personalized attention during our meals, the team made every detail feel thoughtful and sincere. The resort grounds are immaculate, offering a perfect blend of elegance and tropical beauty. The restaurants served world-class cuisine, and the beachfront location gave us postcard-worthy views every single day.

The food at the restaurant Kwee Zeen and Cocina has no taste. The have a pizza oven, but the pizza looks like a crusty crêpe with some tomate soup or ketchup... The water in the swimming pool is blurry. Even if I warm them about the color, they didn't take action. The five star is not for the food.... I was very disappointed about the stay. The club millésime is very nice and the is kind and professional. Don't go to Sofitel. You pay too much for less confort and less pleasure."

The staff were friendly and attentive, and the resort overall was beautiful and peaceful. Breakfasts were delicious with plenty of variety. A perfect spot for a relaxing family getaway. We’d love to come back!"
"79.","Francesco Russo","228","2025-09-01","5","We had a truly fantastic dinner. Everything was so well done, and the staff was incredibly attentive. We were served by Marsi, who was exceptionally accommodating and attentive to our every need. The setting is absolutely beautiful. We dined under a gorgeous tree, surrounded by lush greenery and a stunning view of the beach. The atmosphere was enhanced by great live music. The food was also outstanding. We particularly enjoyed the mixed grill, which was incredibly flavorful and cooked to perfection. We can't wait to come back!"

Our day started with breakfast at Kwee Zeen, so many choices, fabulous! Mira (Kwee Zeen), was so attentive, and professional. Really enjoyed talking with her about food, culture and local places to visit. Asih (house keeping), always welcomed us with her beautiful smile. Made sure we had everything we needed. We felt so welcomed by her. Our room was always beautiful, thank you!"

"84.","Daniel Sgroi","245","2025-12-18","3","Coming from the Padma Resort we stayed three-night at the Sofitel Resort. While the resort's aesthetics are undeniably stunning, with its prime beachside location and restaurants offering picturesque ocean views, my overall experience was unfortunately affected by several concerns. Firstly, I found the pathways surrounding the pools to be uncomfortable to walk on; the black pavers felt uncomfortably hot underfoot. Furthermore, the condition of the corridors outside the rooms and stairwells was disappointing, marred by paint stains that detracted from the overall ambiance. In our room, the lounge area had a significant stain that had clearly been overlooked. Additionally, I felt that the pricing for food and drinks was excessively high for the quality provided. Specifically, the prices at the Bali Collection seemed unjustifiably similar to those in Sydney, which I found to be excessive."
"85.","Neeti Kanwar","26","2025-08-01","5","Luxurious Stay with Amazing Food and Private Pool Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua is a truly luxurious resort with a perfect beachfront location. Our room had a private plunge pool, which was a highlight — relaxing, private, and so enjoyable. The resort itself is big, beautifully designed, and full of tropical charm. The food was excellent with plenty of variety, especially at breakfast. Every meal was delicious, and the service throughout the stay was friendly and professional. The main pool is large and fun, and the whole atmosphere is peaceful yet vibrant."

They created such a great environment for the children and in particular the butler team of Suci, Edi, Ayu & Bagus were incredible, offering 5 star service throughout our stay and are a real credit to the Sofitel. We would absolutely recommend to anyone seeking a resort holiday in Bali. We will be back next year!"

I thoroughly recommend Sofitel for it’s location, food and staff"

Three years ago, before marrying my current wife, I had such good memories that we got married and visited this hotel again. Beyond my expectations, my memory of this hotel has improved. Manager RAI's hospitality service, meticulous care, and daily support for Butler Eddie and DIAH to enjoy the hotel. I hope I can visit again this hotel again with my family upcoming day."

"91.","John Kelley","32","2025-09-01","4","Totally changing my review. Initially I was frustrated by some problems with my room and the speed of service, but after speaking with management team, they really jumped into action to make things right for us. It is a beautiful resort and the staff are all eager to please. I will say that during our one week stay in mid-August that the main pool area was completely overrun by children. Even the swim up bar had kids bumping into us. It does seem to be a great place for families with young kids. If, like us, you prefer to get away from the kids, the beach is nice, but get there early as there is limited seating. Also the Manarai Beach Club adjacent to Sofitel is very nice and not as crowded. It has nice pool, swim up bar, restaurant and daybeds. Didn’t notice any kids there, but I think you have to buy a membership to use the pool. Not sure about that. Sofitel rooms are starting to show their age. I would not classify it as 5-stat, but it is a solid 4-star. Food was decent. The Sunday brunch was really good, definitely worth the price."
"92.","Cindy Shi","4","2025-10-01","5","I recently stayed at Sofitel Nusa Dua for 4 nights in September and had a truly wonderful experience. One of the highlights was the breakfast – the variety of choices was impressive, catering to both international and local tastes. Everything was fresh, well-prepared, and beautifully presented. A special mention to Wikan, who provided exceptional service throughout our stay. He was always attentive, friendly, and went out of his way to ensure we were comfortable and well taken care of. His genuine care and professionalism made a big difference in our experience. Thank you to the entire team at Sofitel Nusa Dua for a memorable stay – we look forward to returning!"

"94.","Akaash Singh","60","2025-11-01","5","We enjoyed staying here for a big fat Indian wedding. The only problem we had was that we had a cleartoilet door meaning that whoever was brushing their teeth could look into the toilet. Ideally, there would be a way to close off that space for some privacy - not a major issue, but that would have helped."

"98.","Alexander Kogen","2","2025-08-01","5","We had a truly wonderful stay at the Sofitel Hotel in Bali, our second time here, and once again, it exceeded all expectations! From the moment we arrived, we were warmly welcomed and felt right at home. The hotel fulfilled every request we had quickly and effortlessly, with everything handled professionally and with genuine care. What really stood out to us was the incredible staff. Everyone from reception to housekeeping to the restaurant team, was incredibly kind, open, and attentive. Every question or need was met without delay, always with a smile. The restaurant staff, in particular, made our dining experiences extra special with their warmth and friendliness. The food was amazing, and the atmosphere felt like home. We are so happy with both of our visits and are already looking forward to coming back again. Thank you to the entire Sofitel Bali team for making our stay so comfortable, relaxing, and memorable!"

"100.","Hugo Ramos","24","2025-11-01","3","VERY DISAPPOINTED This was the second time that we stayed at this hotel this year. We were 13 people, 4 families in 5 rooms, over a period of 11 days. From the first day we noticed that maintenance is neglected, particularly at the swimming pool where you can suffer small cuts in your feet due to the deteriorating condition of the floor. At the time of reservation, I asked for a late check out for 1 of the rooms. On the day of departure, we were informed that only 1 hour for late check out was approved but we can stay at the hotel for a late shower. WHAT NOBODY SAID The only available showers offered were those near the main swimming pool. These showers do not have any kind of privacy; you must shower in an open place in front of anyone with cold water (there is not hot water at all) and the drains were clogged with water up to the ankles."
"101.","Christophe Koessler","83","2025-10-01","3","We spent 4 nights here during our multi stop vacation. The staff was great and welcoming, which was the highlight of our stay. The room was nice but standard for a 5* at that price. We had a good stay but it didn't feel any special. In fact, we missed the hotel we stayed out during our previous stop on the island. The hotel is more of a resort, in a high end secluded tourist area. Don't expect any immersion in the culture there. The two points that were a big let down were: 1- The breakfast was not good. It's a bit ironic for a hotel that plays on the French touch not to be able to make a proper croissant (the other hotel was able to, so it's not due to a lack of produce). Even the local Balinese/Indonesian food was subpar compared to our previous stop at a different hotel. This matters when you are in an area where you don't really have many options around. Because of this we avoided getting any lunch or dinner and opted to walk 20 min to the neighborhood mall everyday instead. 2- Even though it's already a pricey hotel for Bali, everything felt like an add-on, for which we have to pay extra. Feel like a yoga class to start your day? There's a fee... Want to borrow one of the bicycles to go around the neighborhood? There's also a fee... Feel like enjoying the beach club which is the only place that has a pool with a view on the beach? Yeah... There's also a fee for that... Add the fact that all prices are 5 to 10x the cost at other local options and you really feel like a piggy bank walking around. If you like resort style vacation and don't mind paying for every move you make, it may be a good spot, I personally will not come back."
"102.","Raman Arora","2","2025-08-01","1","Disappointing Birthday Stay at Sofitel Bali – Not What I Expected from a Luxury Property I stayed at Sofitel Bali for three nights to celebrate a landmark birthday — a milestone I was hoping to mark with a memorable experience. Unfortunately, several serious lapses made the stay anything but enjoyable. 1. Check-in Delays: Despite a confirmed check-in time, we were made to wait nearly two hours before getting our room. After a long journey, this was incredibly frustrating. 2. Dangerous Bicycle Incident: While cycling on one of the hotel’s bicycles, the crank literally broke off mid-ride, causing a violent slip and a near-injury. I was lucky not to have fractured my leg. When I returned to the hotel with the broken crank and requested transportation for my two friends still cycling, the staff refused to help — a shocking response to a potentially serious safety issue. 3. Unauthorized Credit Card Charge: After settling my bill at checkout, I later received a manual charge on my credit card without any communication or consent. While the amount may have been correct, charging a guest post-checkout without informing them is deeply unprofessional and frankly, borders on fraud. When I raised these concerns, the duty manager offered some loyalty points as compensation — but that felt like an afterthought rather than a genuine attempt to make things right. For a brand that promises luxury and service excellence, this stay was sorely disappointing. I hope the management takes these issues seriously — no guest should have to deal with safety hazards, poor service, or billing surprises, especially when celebrating a once-in-a-decade occasion."

"105.","YewTeck","42","2025-08-01","5","Breakfast had wide variety and the food was spread out hence it doesn't feel crowded although this is peak season. The lounge was pleasant - breakfast in the morning, afternoon tea from 3-5pm and evening canapes from 530-730pm. The afternoon tea came in very nice display tray. We enjoyed chilling by the swimming pool during the day and by the beach just before sunset. Tried dinner at Toya Restaurant as well by the beach - as it's peak season reservation recommendation. Thanks to Davipa from housekeeping our room was kept clean and neat with ample bottles of water. We had floating breakfast in our plunge pool - first time trying and good for Instagram."

"107.","Eunice SYL","43","2025-08-01","3","Loved the great location on Nusa Dua beach front. Stayed during peak season, pool side lounge chairs were fully occupied and the pool was crowded, not as expected. Breakfast has good options but service was slow especially coffee and individual prepared noodle section. Rooms were given 3 stars as it wasn’t newly refurbished although some reviewers mentioned so, or perhaps our room category was not done yet. Overall did not enjoyed the stay as there’s too crowded."
"108.","Suzanne Gratton","9","2025-12-11","5","Loved the clean beach and being comfortable to swim in the sea. The pool was great too. Could have had an extra set of steps in the smaller pool near the lounges."

The personnel (minus 1 case) with a well -known attention are super friendly and careful. The half pension badly give very little food and almost everything charges you an extra. We had dinner yesterday and see the photo of the dish that put a 10 -year -old girl, 3 chicken portions and a dessert is all dinner and you tell him and the toya manager (the worst professional we saw in Bali in our 15 days, it should not be from Bali or at least the karma is not from Bali) did not lend us the minimum. Erik the waiter very good attention The perfect hotel. The beach is not good"

Adding a nice touch to make our stay even more pleasant. Thank you Mario and Sofitel team!"
"113.","Vicki Raina","29","2025-10-01","4","There is a lot to like about the Sofitel. We stayed for 10 days during July. The room was very nice and we enjoyed the tranquility of the location. If you want peace and quiet then compared to many locations the Sofitel provides this. We used the gym during our stay and found it to be very good compared to many places. The pool closes very early at 7pm we probably wouldn’t have stayed if we had realised in advance and this might be a deciding factor for some. We worked with the time of the pool closure but given there isn’t much around except your hotel this should be perhaps reconsidered by the Sofitel. Some other downsides included being refused soft drink on our free welcome drinks and being refused 2 drinks with our 2 vouchers. We were only allowed a single cocktail or alcoholic beverage from a limited menu. I complained and got told I should go and see management if I was unhappy which did make me a bit more unhappy. Obviously a training issue there and management did profusely apologise. The other was deciding to use the spa facilities and paying for the worst massage experience in at least 20 years at an extremely high cost. My mother enjoyed her massage experience."
"114.","Kasey Neave","9","2025-08-01","5","Perfect Honeymoon Destination in Bali! My husband and I spent 12 incredible nights in the Honeymoon Suite, and everything about our stay was absolutely perfect.

The resort has plenty to offer to fill in those days when you don't want to leave the resort. Club access was totally worth it, providing great perks and service. And you absolutely *must* try the spa – it's truly incredible! A special shout-out to our butler - Edi, who made our stay so seamless and enjoyable. He went above and beyond to ensure every detail was taken care of. We can't recommend this hotel enough for a romantic getaway or honeymoon in Bali!"
"115.","Marex Cad","40","2025-09-01","4","Our stay at Sofitel Nusa Dua was overall okay, but there were several points that could have been improved. Check-In: The check-in experience was disappointing as we received our room later than the official check-in time. After a long journey, this was not ideal. Staff: In general, the staff was friendly and helpful. However, there were a few exceptions. The waitress at the lobby bar was very strict and not welcoming, which gave a bad first impression. Additionally, one of the female waitresses at the pool bar was extremely rude, when handing me my drink, she almost threw it into the pool, which was shocking. On the positive side, Sri really stood out; she was always smiling and eager to help, making our experience much better. Also, the male waiters at the pool were all very nice and attentive. Room: The room was modern and clean, thanks to the amazing housekeeping team, but it felt a bit too small for our taste. Facilities: The pools were beautiful, but the management should be stricter about guests reserving sunbeds and then leaving. Many sunbeds were occupied with towels but no guests in sight. Food & Drinks: The food was delicious, both at breakfast and in the restaurants, and the drinks were great too. It is also worth mentioning that the coffee was incredible. That said, we found the prices extremely high for Bali. Beach: The biggest downside was the beach. The slope into the water was quite abrupt, and the sand was muddy and unpleasant, it felt like your feet were sinking into it. Of course, this isn’t the hotel’s fault, but it’s worth mentioning for those who expect a pristine beach experience."
"116.","Claire Y","22","2025-11-01","1","After a personal emergency, I received horrifying service from this hotel’s reservations team. Among other things, (1) they unilaterally cancelled my reservation without express confirmation from me that they should cancel it; (2) despite one night being on a flexible rate for which I *VOLUNTARILY* prepaid and would otherwise not have even charged for when I had to cancel my stay, they told me the prepayment for that night (together with all other nights) would be kept (despite the fact that I offered to prepay); and they offered no form of goodwill until I copied in the Accor Plus (loyalty means nothing to the Sofitel Bali) team, and even then, they didn’t reply to my various emails until the Accor Plus chased them. They then said that their goodwill gesture would be a “special rate” in the future. This was meaningless given I intend never to stay at Sofitel Bali after this experience, and pales in contrast to two other comparable hotels that (a) offered to cancel without penalty and (b) to postpone my stay to the future where I paid a rate difference. There are 5* hotels and there are 5* hotels and, in Bali, there are choices. Don’t book at the Sofitel Bali if you’re expecting an empathetic or flexible reservations team. Edit: to be clear, nobody reached out to me to offer assistance. I offered to pay more for a future stay. I offered to pay an admin fee. Anything to not lose the money already paid. You guys didn’t bother and simply kept the money."

"119.","Dani Mc","13","2025-09-01","5","We recently returned from a family holiday to Bali and had the luxury of spending one night at the Sofitel Nusa Dua as part of the Accor Plus membership. From the start we were warmly welcomed to The spectacular lounge area. While our room was not ready initially (we arrive approximately 2 pm for a 3 pm check-in). The comfort of Waiting in the lounge with afternoon tea and drinks was greatly appreciated. Our upgraded room was nothing short of spectacular – The Pool Access room was luxurious its modern appointments and access to the pool. As a family of three (2A, 1C) the room was spacious enough as we spent all of our time outside it. The resort is spacious, well maintained, clean within an inch of its life and a true place of relaxation. Whilst we didn’t get the opportunity to experience all of the facilities such as the table tennis, gym, tennis, we hope to return in the future. Highlights - staff, pools, cabanas, lounge, pool access room, breakfast juices, many breakfast options. Low lights - people vaping around the pool, breakfast buffet food was tepid in temperature unless cooked immediately for you, not having enough time to really enjoy the resort!"

Di hari yang sama sambil nunggu check-in, staff di area aktifitas arah ke Toya, saya dikira mba-mba bagi brosur. Pas kamar lagi rest, ada yang bell dan coba buka pintu, itu pertama. Yang kedua, lagi rest juga dan ada yang bell kasih invitation padahal udah dikasih pas check-in. Saat breakfast, makan ga tenang karena meja yang di-assign buat saya dipake orang lain. Bolak-balik ambil makanan, meja saya dibersihin terus padahal masih ada yang saya makan/minum. Saya akhirnya keliling dengan mata rabun karena ninggalin kacamata biar ketauan ada orang di meja itu. Terakhir, book dinner buat nanti malam. Saya iseng confirm ternyata tidak terdaftar. Semoga bukan karena saya ga kelihatan fashionable ya, kaya orang ga punya uang. Untuk makanan breakfast di Kwee Zeen menurut saya oke. Gatau nih kalo dinner di Kwee Zeen. Katanya buffet, semoga ga tiba2 ala carte. Saya ga tertarik coba Cuccina karena reviewnya kurang bagus. Kalo Toya saya tertarik tapi hujan terus."

The rooms are spacious, elegant, and incredibly comfortable — we especially loved the plush Sofitel bedding and beautiful ocean views. One of the highlights of our stay was joining Club Millésime — it elevated the entire experience. The exclusive lounge access, afternoon tea, evening cocktails, and personalized service made everything feel even more luxurious and special. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a premium touch! The pool area is stunning, and the beach is just steps away with soft white sand and clear water. The breakfast buffet is one of the best we’ve had, with a wide variety of delicious international and local dishes. The spa is also worth visiting — so relaxing and beautifully designed.

"134.","Paul and Natalie Swindale","3","2025-07-01","5","Our experience at the Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua was incredible. The staff went above and beyond to make sure our stay was enjoyable. Great food choices, rooms serviced daily and lots of activities for families. Our room attendant Mario was great and would check in on us a few times a day to ensure we had everything we needed. The pool area and pool bar was great for swimming up too for drinks and food. Highly recommend"

I stayed for three nights and was satisfied with every aspect of the experience, including the breakfast, pool, and Club Millésime. All the staff were friendly, and the professional service from the lounge team was especially impressive. It was such a wonderful stay that I will definitely return the next time I visit Bali."

"139.","Shenae Comley","18","2025-08-01","5","Sofitel Nusa Dua Resort was absolutely incredible! The buffet breakfast was easily one of the best I’ve ever experienced — endless options and presented so elegantly. Our room was stunning — spacious, spotless, and beautifully maintained. Every single staff member was so warm and welcoming, even those just passing by would stop to say “bonjour!” The pool area was fantastic, and the beach beds and shaded beach temples were perfect. We also had a massage on the beach which was pure bliss — truly a 10/10 experience, one of the best massages we’ve ever had. The beachfront itself was pristine and beautifully looked after. We couldn’t recommend this place more!"
"140.","jie yong ng","1","2025-12-01","1","Service was good and the suite was rather decent, but the incessant music from the adjacent beach club ruins the entire stay and experience. Doesn't seem like there's much the management can do about it as well. If you are looking for a quiet stay, do look elsewhere as this isn't the place for it."
"141.","Ryan Halim","8","2025-12-01","5","Lovely resort and a very pleasant stay. Breakfast could be improved, but overall great hospitality — especially from the Club Millésime team and Miss Lestari at the front desk."
"142.","Ann Bell","97","2025-08-01","5","I do not normally stay at resorts but enjoyed a few days here at the end of a trip to Indonesia. Staff amazing, as usual, a very comfortable Sofitel room, great location with beachfront access connecting, along a path, with other beachfront properties so a great walk or run possible early morning, along with sunrise views. Pools a bit crowded and noisy but it is a large property and school holidays. They were a bit slow removing towels after guests had left, otherwise service exceptional."
"143.","Ajay Bhola","6","2025-09-01","5","My family loved staying in Sofitel Nusa Dua. The hotel is excellent, cleanliness is awesome, staff is very friendly and willing to help. We booked breakfast and being pure vegetarian we were initially concerned if it will be worth but Indian vegetarian was a highlight apart from many other items. Shree, one of your staff in breakfast area and Indian Chef were great. Keep it up and we will come again."

"145.","Susana Juwono","518","2025-11-01","1","We arrived at 13.00 where the loby is pack full of guests waiting to checked in room. It was so hot. The AC didn't work. After submitting the personal info, we waited in the room which is very hot and packed of people. The lady seated us at 13.50 to fill the form and process to check in but still no room available. The lady informed that will be WA message when the room is ready. We asked to use gym or other facilities but rejected, no key room, cannot enter the gym . We sit wasted our time until 16.07 got WA information our room is ready. When we entered the room, it is already for other guest.... How can Sofitel, the premium hotel miss management during check in ? It was really a mess and wasting our time for 3 hours doing nothing in the loby. I heard the gentleman in the check in desk said over the phone : why didn't queued the room from 13.50 ? He has to apology for several time, but we already tired"

"148.","Ruxandra I","13","2025-08-01","5","We had a wonderful experience at Sofitel in Nusa Dua. The rooms are spacious and beautifully decorated, featuring large, incredibly comfortable beds, air conditioning, and generous bathrooms. We stayed in a Luxury Double Room, which was lovely — but if possible, we highly recommend choosing a room with a private or plunge pool for an even more special experience. A heartfelt thank you to Asih, who kept our room spotless and made it feel fresh and welcoming every day. The breakfast was excellent, with a wide variety of delicious options to suit every preference. The pool area is large and peaceful, with plenty of comfortable places to relax. The hotel restaurants are a bit on the expensive side, but the food is decent and the service is truly excellent. Special thanks to Bagia for helping us organize activities like bicycle rentals and badminton — his support added a personal and friendly touch to our stay. One small suggestion would be for the hotel to be more consistent with personalized touches. Some of our friends received welcome fruit plates or small surprises in their rooms, which added a thoughtful feel — it would have been nice to have experienced the same. Lastly, while some staff members could improve their English, their warmth, kindness, and willingness to help more than made up for it. Overall, we had a memorable and relaxing stay and would gladly return."

Location is terrible, you’re trapped in resort land. And the pool is nothing like the photos. Wouldn’t recommend unless I had a family. Not a Bali or Indonesia experience at all. Feels like Orlando, FL."

A special thank you to Miss Prilia, whose kindness and professionalism guided us through every detail with such care. ❤️"
"158.","Virginie LD","28","2025-08-01","3","The resort itself is quite pleasant and the rooms are spacious. However, we experienced a very serious issue with the swimming pool. While swimming there as a family, all four of us suffered burns to the soles of our feet. It was extremely painful. Despite reporting this twice at the reception and showing our burns, our complaint was never properly addressed. I explained that the pool is often used by families with children and even babies, and that it is unacceptable not to have more information about this type of incident or to see any corrective action taken. The staff, although very friendly, only responded with “thank you, sorry.” This is simply not acceptable for hotel guests, especially as the pool is apparently very dangerous due to the chemicals it contains."
"159.","George Da silva","10","2025-06-01","5","A Dream Stay at Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua! No doubt: one of the most beautiful hotels I’ve ever stayed at! The hotel grounds are stunning, and the room was one of the most spacious I’ve seen—modern, spotless, and very well maintained. The swimming pool is beautifully designed, and the pool bar made it even more enjoyable to relax there all day (yes, I did! 😄). Breakfast was amazing, with a wide variety of dishes—Japanese, Indian, Western, and of course, delicious Indonesian food. Lots of fresh pastries too! Check-in felt luxurious, and the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful throughout my stay. It’s a large resort, so expect a lot of space and options. Food at the hotel is a bit pricey, but the good news is you can walk along the beach to Bali Collection, a nearby open-air shopping and dining area with more affordable restaurants. There’s also a shuttle bus every hour if you prefer not to walk. I couldn’t have asked for more. I was looking for a cozy and relaxing escape—and this place delivered. My only regret? The stay was too short!"

From the moment we stepped in, we were welcomed with five-star service that exceeded our expectations. The environment was wonderfully family-friendly, striking the perfect balance between luxury and enjoyment. We thoroughly enjoyed relaxing with the soothing spa treatments, participating in the lovely beach activities, and having convenient access to fantastic shopping options nearby. Each day brought something fresh and memorable. The property itself is absolutely stunning—lush, well-kept grounds with breathtaking ocean views that seem like they belong on a postcard. The staff was exceptional—always attentive, friendly, and eager to help with anything we required. Unlike many standard travel experiences, the Sofitel provided something truly remarkable: a feeling of tranquility, warmth, and authentic hospitality. We departed feeling rejuvenated, joyful, and already dreaming about our next visit ."
"162.","Domi Krivanekova","12","2025-07-01","5","This resort is truly a luxurious paradise, words can’t describe it. We came for our Baby-moon and stayed for 4 nights, we got a very kind upgrade from a normal room to a room with a plunge pool which was very nice. Our bed was super big and comfortable, the bathtub was nice and the shower was well equipped with L’occitane products which felt very luxurious. The location is great, we didn’t have to leave the resort at all because we had easy access to the beach, restaurants and pool. Their breakfast is super delicious, so many endless options! Their service is amazing- anything you ask for, they will happily attend to your needs. The staff are so very kind. This is by far our favourite hotel we’ve ever been at and we truly recommend it for anyone coming to Bali. We will 10000% be coming back next year!"

She was very helpful, polite and our baby liked her a lot. This hotel is in the perfect location, close to 7/11 and Bali Collection. Other hotels are also quite extravagant, but I especially like Sofitel because it’s not TOO big. This is helpful because you don’t have to walk too long to get to your room, pool or back to lobby."

The Sofitel is perfect for a short stay (up to a week) and is really good value for money, especially if you are an Accor member.

We especially loved the beach barbecue restaurant, which had outstanding live music every night, and the happy hours occurring in the late afternoon."

"180.","Drew Stephens","31","2025-09-01","3","For loyal Accor members who expect to find true 5-star VIP attention, you may wish to stay elsewhere. This Sofitel is more like an overcrowded family mega-resort, not a place for upscale adult experiences. The Club upgrade has almost no value, as the lounge is crowded and noisy with speaker phones, and children - even at cocktail hour. Public pool is large and interesting, but there were few open lounge chairs."

The house keepers were incredible and very friendly, and all the staff gave us good recommendations for dinner, coffee, shopping, when we asked!

In our room we encountered the following issues: 1) Minimal wardrobe space, nowhere near enough for a couple of 2. We had to resort to leaving piles of clothes on the sofa 2) No hot water for the bath 3) Poor water pressure in the shower 4) No full length mirror 5) Furniture is in disrepair and needs replacing 6) There is no sound proofing in any of the rooms, which means you are awoken by neighbouring rooms or people in the hallway. 7) Worst of all the rooms are all extremely damp and your belongings will get damp just by having them in the room, even with the AC on. Even around the communal parts of the hotel you can see that things are not well looked after or maintained such as loose bricks, poor finishing and general disrepair."

This part of Bali is totally different place than other parts of Bali. Servicing and welcoming to hotel were great. We have been welcomed by drink and a wrest band symbol of love, peace and spiritual. The pool and bar in the poil were great. The breakfast was the best on the world and actually the hotel awarded the best breakfast in the world. The room was big and designed beautifully, however, the furniture made from wood and most of them detoriated and the wood was destroyed. I found two small insect in the wooden shower curtain which probably does not clean for a long time (please clean it room 5209) The private beach and activities as well as welcome drink and fresh towel everytime you go to the pool were amazing. To me this is respect to customers. The sleep pillow selection like other Sofitel hotel were great, however, some staff are not familiar with this and even after requesting several times the staff bring the normal pillow. They should trained better. The bad thing happened was the big weeking in our hotel which the sound was very high and annoying for other customers. Also due to the weeding, the facilities and activities became limited only becasue for this weeding, which is unfair to others. The staff all of them were amazing, kind respectful and super friendly. Our romantic dinner on beach was unforgettable and we had the best time and best trip ever on our life. We hope to come back again and see the beautiful Bali with its amazing people."

I think it’s absolutely perfect. The layout, the lush gardens, the pools, the private rooms of course, the restaurants and bars. Everything is exceptional. But what truly makes this resort so special is the really lovely staff who are always smiling and who are so willing to make your experience the very best it can be. I feel that they are very genuine and generous in their endeavour to assist you in any way. For example Diah who cleans our room. She has the most gorgeous smile every time we interact and she’s brilliant at cleaning our room. One more example of this I would love to share is the very beautiful Deva from Kwee Zeen restaurant. Not only was he excellent at his job he was so smiley and friendly and conversational with us. This made us feel so extra special and created such a wonderful dining experience. Bravo Sofitel Nusa Dua and thank you so much!"

In particular Amy the Director of rooms was amazing, she took the time to get to know my wife and I, we really enjoyed chatting with her and learning about Bali, she went the extra step at all times to really make us feel special.

Club lounge had excellent afternoon tea and cocktail options but the evening canapes were very basic and pretty average. Kids enjoyed the kids club and all staff are welcoming. Restaurant options aren't the best."

Amazing for a summer holiday when its veyr hot and humid to just jump straight into the pool from the room and easy to clean up and shower when leaving the pool instaed of having to like run to a towel area, dry off and walk through cold air con to make it back to the rooms soaked and cold. The buffet selection was also very nice and the staff working are very accomodating."
"203.","Adelaide Schumann","2","2025-09-01","3","Overall we had a pleasant holiday at the Sofitel Nusa Dua. We started our stay in an ocean view room and then moved to a villla. The people who work here have been amazing; friendly, courteous, professional. The kids club was welcoming and our kids loved it. The restaurants were good - both service and cuisine wise. We should probably note that the butler service for the villa was not provided for us during our stay until our last day. There were some addition draw backs to consider. This is the loudest resort, or environment generally, I have been almost ever. There is incredibly loud music from early afternoon through to 10:30/11 every night - so loud that you can’t escape identify song lyrics while in your room trying to sleep. We found it impossible to actually relax. As an aside to the bear constant noise, the rooms need some love. During our stay there wasn’t a single room that we stayed in that something wasn’t broken - doors on cupboards falling off, pool lights not working, electrical outlets not working, drains backing up, etc. We also got gastro while eating and staying exclusively at the resort and the villa was packed full of mosquitos. Hopefully nothing more nefarious comes from that. Overall, it’s a beautiful resort but it is a bit of a contradiction. It has incredibly generous villas that are laden with mosquitos and don’t necessarily provide the service level promised. It is a serene landscape with a lovely spa, but it is also trying to be the loudest nightclub in Nusa Dua - which is ironic considering the vast majority of people here are young families or retired."

The hotel was great, especially our room, the housekeeping staff were fantastic)especially Sugi who was very helpful and efficient. The only let down about the whole of the hotel was the food offering, we went to the three restaurants and both the Italian and International restaurants were very disappointing, both in quality of food and service. It will stop us from returning, however we will go to outside restaurants for our meals."

The service was truly outstanding—everyone was incredibly friendly, kind, and attentive from the moment we arrived. The entire resort was spotless, and everything felt very well maintained. Breakfast was a highlight each morning with an impressive variety and everything we tried was absolutely delicious. We also loved the pool bar—cocktails were great, and happy hour every afternoon made it even better. The spa services were top-notch; we chose the gazebo option and it was such a peaceful, relaxing experience. A little mall with decent options is also located nearby (Bali Collection) and there are shuttles from the hotel, but we chose to walk and it ended up being a nice nightly stroll for us. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a luxurious and serene getaway in Bali!"
"210.","Saanch","4","2025-08-01","4","Just checked in and found the welcome quite average, especially at the reception. We’ve stayed at other Sofitels before, but so far, this stay seems to be the disappointing one. We were delayed by 45 minutes before getting into our rooms — a late check-in, despite arriving on time. All we received was a half-hearted apology. We’ll be staying here for two more days, and I truly hope the experience improves. We spent two days at Mövenpick earlier and are already wishing we had stayed there for the rest of our trip. I’ll keep this post updated. 24/07: Updating my rating to 4 stars as the resort staff later contacted me, apologised for the 45-minute delay which we appreciated (we were also offered a complimentary service); additionally, we liked the kids club and thoroughly enjoyed the private beach."
"211.","Avelien Strickland","23","2025-08-01","4","The staff were definitely the highlight of our stay. Bayu, Ayu and Nicky made sure we always had a point of contact during our stay and gave warm & genuine customer service. Subrata looked after us and our suite perfectly, ensuring we had everything we needed at all times. Overall, the Sofitel didn't meet our expectations. What we felt let the experience down was the layout of the breakfast buffet (difficult with different rooms/zones for food. Lack of AC), the quality of food and beverages, the lack of space in the pool area, maintenance of the pool with numerous loose/broken tiles."

"213.","Sarah North","269","2025-09-01","3","PROS: • Stayed in room D5215. August 2025. • Large breakfast buffet with decent range of food • Cucina restaurant serves very nice Italian food and Wira was a standout waiter. Food overpriced for what you get. • Rooms spacious and well appointed. • Check in process relatively efficient yet they tried to do a lot of upselling on Accor Club which was frustrating as we weren't interested. • Hotel located along a nice beach but honestly, Sanur is much better as there's so much more to do. • Hotel remotely located from shops. If wanting to go to Bali Collection (rip off) it's a IDR50k each way fare. • CONS: • Gym small for 413 rooms and not enough cardio machines which are tucked away in a back room. Also, one treadmill was broken taking them down to 3 treadmills which is too few for a hotel of this size. • Pool area disjointed and has these ridiculous sun beds over water so you can easily drop your belongings into the pool. • Food offering by the pool is OK but don't offer a pizza- they are terrible! Considering the hotel has a wonderful pizza oven in Cucina, you would think they'd be able to cook good Pizzas during the day. • Bikes not free to rent but they should be. Lots of activities on offer at hotel but all are user paid. This is disappointing given the room rates. There was supposedly water aerobics on at 11am each day but in our 5 days we couldn't find this. • Insufficient sunbeds for 413 rooms. • Kids pool area limited compared to other nearby hotels. • Rooms not well insulated with lots of noise from other rooms and corridor throughout night. • When doorbell rings to adjoining room, it sounds like its coming to our room. • Room slippers provided are very basic and for a hotel where you are paying $AUD700 a night, you'd expect better quality. • Breakfast buffet needs to be mixed up more. After 5 days i had had enough of the same offerings. • Range of vegan options at breakfast limited (i.e. I couldn't find almond milk or decent tasting coconut yoghurt) • Turn down service is poor with them only replacing water and closing blinds (if they turn up at all). Turn down service should include fruits or a chocolate at a hotel that charges this much. • Room cleaning was done at about 4pm each day which is unacceptable. Way too late. Room cleaning and turn down service were often combined. • Bed not overly comfortable. Base hard. • Pool area cramped in like sardines. All other hotels along Nusa Dua strip are much larger and so much more space."

The resort is stunning, well-kept, and incredibly family-friendly. A special shoutout to Sri, who looked after us every morning at breakfast. She was so kind and attentive — always happy to help with anything we needed for our toddler who had just turned 2, from warming up milk to making sure we had a high chair ready.

"217.","Thu Tieu (Face Made Up)","14","2025-09-01","4","It was our first time at the Sofitel Nusa Dua and we were not disappointed. We booked a two bed villa with a private pool which was absolutely huge. The kids bedroom had two king single beds and is only accessible from inside the villa (many villas we have looked at before booking the Sofitel provided access to the kids/secondary bedroom from outside the villa which is a no no for us with two young kids). The location was perfect, being right by the beach and close to lots of restaurants and other hotels. The service was faultless - we had a morning butler and evening butler who catered to all our needs (special mention to Suci, Eddie, Ayu and Bagus, and Triana from the Kids Club). The hotel is very kid friendly with an on site kids club with a daily schedule. The only thing we thought could be improved was the consistency of food across all restaurants - Toya was good for lunch and dinner (although twice they had run out of a number of dishes on different days), Kwee Zeen served up a mean buffet breakfast with so much choice. However, we were disappointed with the room service food- the quality was nowhere near as good as we had seen in the restaurants, and the food served by the pool was rather poor too - their tuna sandwich had barely any tuna in it, more like a finger roll with egg salad. All in all, we did have a great stay at the Sofitel and the kids thoroughly enjoyed their time there."
"218.","James Habershon","56","2025-09-01","4","Great stay with all inclusive luxury escapes. Pool is great for kids. Food through out resort is average. Cucina poor quality as is Toya. Staff are exceptional, especially ASIH who kept the room tidy and Darma at the Pool was an awesome host."

In my opinion they need to tackle the humidity issue, had a strange smell like the room windows weren’t opened enough, my entry lights were not working when I arrived but has been fixed quickly. Bathroom sliding doors didn't slide properly leaving some marks on the floor. Shower hose had black stains, I guess due to humidity, which doesn’t look ‘clean’. Overall a very pleasant stay, there are few details that make the difference between a good and perfect stay considering it is a 5 stars hotel."

I was just disappointed that we had a leak in our bathroom that ruined most of my makeup etc. The issue was fixed by a plumber but nobody from the hotel touched based to see if all had been fixed and an apology for the damage that it had caused. I was also disappointed on the last day when I wanted a glass of water from the bar and the bartender said I had to buy it or have the tap water! I asked if the tap water was ok to drink and his reply was no not really. Not what I would expect from a 5 star hotel."

"256.","Robert (Djrahar)","216","2025-05-01","5","From the moment I booked through the app, my experience at Sofitel Nusa Dua was nothing short of exceptional. I received a thoughtful pre-arrival email asking about my preferences and dietary requirements—something few hotels ever consider. This level of personalized care made me feel at home even before I arrived. Having stayed at renowned properties such as Raffles and Kempinski, I can confidently say that Sofitel Nusa Dua exceeded all expectations. The Ambassadors at Sofitel truly embody the spirit of hospitality. Every guest is made to feel genuinely welcome and cared for—something even the most prestigious hotels sometimes miss. Service throughout the hotel was flawless. Every staff member we encountered was warm, friendly, and eager to help. I’ve stayed at many properties in Nusa Dua, including big-name resorts, but very few come close to this level of service. One moment that really stood out was during in-room dining: the chef personally crafted a diabetes-friendly Soto Ayam just for me. That extra effort left a lasting impression—it was both thoughtful and unforgettable. As a family-friendly resort, Sofitel also shines. The kids’ club is among the best equipped I’ve seen. It allowed my child to enjoy quality time while my wife and I could relax over a quiet lunch or a drink together—something we deeply appreciated. That said, there were a few areas for improvement. The room, while very clean, showed signs of wear. The flooring and furniture could use better maintenance. Upon arrival, the faucet in the bathroom was broken and required a visit from engineering. The showerhead didn’t provide a consistent spray, and the bed felt uneven—slightly lower at the head side. Despite these minor issues, our departure experience was a perfect closing note. The checkout was quick and seamless. Instead of standing in line, we were invited to relax while an Ambassador handled everything and informed us when it was complete—another example of their impeccable service. In conclusion, no other hotel stay—past or present—has matched the personalized hospitality and warmth we experienced at Sofitel Nusa Dua. It was truly a memorable stay, and we look forward to returning."
"257.","muhammad iqbal","2","2025-07-01","4","On my final day in Bali, I sought solace and rejuvenation at the Sofitel, hoping to restore my mind and lift my spirits. Regrettably, from the moment I arrived, I encountered setbacks that overshadowed my expectations. The bathtub faucet was broken, requiring over 45 minutes of maintenance to repair. While the room itself was tastefully appointed (I saw nothing but the parking lot), the poor soundproofing allowed me to hear the guest next door shouting to others early in the morning. Additionally, the sauna and steam room were non-operational—an especially disappointing shortcoming during a peak national holiday period. The staff were courteous and communicative throughout my stay, but the overall facility clearly falls short compared to other hotels in the same price range where amenities function seamlessly. It remains puzzling why such critical facilities were out of service at a time when guests are likely to seek relaxation and comfort the most."

Febri greeted us warmly upon arrival and sent us off with a friendly farewell when we left. Her helpfulness and kind demeanor added to the memorable experience. Ria looked after us during breakfast, and she was absolutely amazing! What is not to love? Highly recommended Sofitel for a luxurious and memorable Bali getaway!"

Check in was shift and Okta was at reception who made our check in a pleasant experience. We give him 5 stars. Room service was amazing as well. Met Suta from House keeping who cleaned and tidied our room. He made sure that the room was well stocked and cleaned to perfection. We give him 5 stars as well. Thank you Sofitel Beach Resort Nusa Dua team for making our stay a pleasant one."
"264.","Danica Robbemond","5","2025-04-01","5","We had a lovely family holiday (all adults) at the Sofitel Nusa Dua. The resort was clean and kept really well. The staff were all very good but I’d like to particularly mention Rista, Siska at Kwee Zeen, Ayu at Toya who were super friendly and helpful, and Gede Ame our room attendant who kept our rooms immaculate. 3 of us also had a massage at the beachfront bungalows which was amazing and something we normally wouldn’t do! The pool was so nice and the chlorine wasn’t too strong :) Nusa Dua is quite far if you’re wanting to spend the day in Canguu or Seminyak. In saying that, we did anyway and so long as you’ve got a good driver who can recommend what time to depart, you might not get stuck in hours of traffic. I think I would prefer to stay in this area again where it’s nice and quiet rather than be constantly in the hustle and bustle. Overall it was an excellent holiday and I’d highly recommend it and would love to visit again."

"269.","Elizabeth Archer","4","2025-04-01","5","This is our third stay at the Sofitel Nusa Dua, and as on previous visits, we enjoyed the professionalism, hospitality and kindness we met throughout this wonderful hotel. Regardless of the time of day or how busy or quiet the hotel might be, everyone we met took the time to smile and greet us by asking us how we were. We have been fortunate to be allocated our favourite room on each visit, a ground floor room with pool access, as we do love the convenience of being able to hop into the pool at any time we choose with such ease. As ACCOR members with lounge access we were taken to the Millesime Lounge to register our arrival and were shown to our room where we were greeted by a beautiful display of flowers, fruits and cakes to welcome our return. It is such a treat to be so spoilt. Although the weather was inclement during most of our stay, there was still much to do and enjoy. The walks along the beach in front of the hotel are well maintained and there is much to enjoy in the large pool with its bar and at the other venues throughout the hotel, including gym and spa. The rooms were beautifully serviced twice a day, and the grounds and facitilies are immaculately clean and well maintained. As we noticed on our previous visit, rooms are continually being repainted and refreshed. We enjoyed an evening meal at Cucina’s the Italian themed restaurant and it was just as lovely as we can remember from our earlier stays. For those with lounge access the afternoon tea and cocktail hour was so well catered that we found we did not really require anything further to eat during the evening. Breakfasts were always excellent with a wonderful choice both from the buffet or from the menu, with the staff took great care catering for special diets. Lots of gluten free options available. The main restaurant downstairs was very popular and we heard many words of praise from other guests about the presentation and quality of the menu. Thank you to everyone who once again made our stay so memorable. Thank you Sugi for the wonderful spa treatment enjoyed during my stay. Particular thanks to Tri the executive manager of the lounge and to the lovely Yuli C M, Kristina, Ayu and everyone in the lounge who took us under their wings during our stay. We are already looking forward to our return!"
"270.","James McCreery","2","2025-04-01","5","Brilliant stay. Luxurious facilities, but it’s really the people and service that set it apart. Across 7 days, I think every single worker said hello when we walked past. Couple of minor room issues, immediately fixed within minutes of raising them. Breakfast is unreal, every possible food you could imagine. We had two restaurants included in our package for dinner. The seafood restaurant on the beach was very good, the dinner buffet was fairly average. Not quite up to the standard elsewhere in the hotel. We paid for dinner at the Italian restaurant one night, outstanding."
"271.","chandra helmawan","39","2025-07-01","5","This was truly the best experience I’ve ever had at a resort. From the moment I arrived, the warm welcome set the tone for a memorable stay. I was greeted kindly by Nindiya at the front desk, and I want to give a special thanks to Kessy from Club Millésime, who went above and beyond, she carefully explained all the privileges and made sure everything was perfect from the start. I was incredibly grateful to receive an upgrade to the Plunge Pool Room. The space was serene, peaceful, an ideal setting to relax and unwind. Breakfast was another highlight, with a wide selection ranging from flavorful Asian dishes to classic Western options. Everything was fresh and beautifully presented. Thank you so much Sofitel Bali."
"272.","Sophie Perica","6","2025-05-01","5","We had the most incredible experience during our honeymoon stay at the Sofitel Resort in Nusa Dua. From the moment we arrived, we were blown away by the exceptional service. The staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and truly special—especially when they learned it was our honeymoon. We were greeted with a thoughtful surprise that added a personal touch to our stay. The resort itself is stunning, with beautiful, well-maintained grounds and luxurious accommodations. Our room was spacious, elegantly designed, and offered breathtaking views. Every detail, from the decor to the comfort of the bed, was perfect. The food at Sofitel was a highlight as well. Whether we were enjoying breakfast at the main restaurant, dining by the pool, or indulging in a romantic dinner, the variety and quality of the food were top-notch. The flavors were rich and authentic, and the presentation was always impressive. Speaking of the pool—what an oasis! The expansive pool area was perfect for relaxing, with comfortable sunbeds and a tranquil atmosphere. We spent hours enjoying the serene surroundings and refreshing waters. Overall, our stay at Sofitel Resort was unforgettable. The staff, the food, the hotel itself, and the pool all made it the perfect place to celebrate our honeymoon. We can’t wait to return!"

She’s an asset to the resort, not many has that quality. Good job to her. The breakfast team is also very good, Miss Wangi who served us was very attentive. We also had dinner at Cucina, excellent service and food."
"278.","Jiten Tibrewala","41","2025-08-01","5","Our stay at Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua was nothing short of a dream — a seamless fusion of five-star luxury, heartfelt Balinese hospitality, and chic French sophistication. From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed not just as guests, but as family — and that feeling stayed with us until the very last goodbye. The staff deserve a standing ovation. Gracious, attentive, and always greeting with a genuine smile, they anticipated our needs before we even voiced them. From the front desk to housekeeping, from the beach attendants to Club Millésime hosts — every interaction was a masterclass in hospitality. It's rare to feel so genuinely cared for, and the Sofitel team truly delivers that magic. Our room was an oasis in itself — elegant, spacious, and designed with both comfort and aesthetics in mind. The plush bedding, the freestanding tub, the subtle touches of local artistry — everything whispered indulgence. And let’s not forget the serene view of the pool and gardens, which felt like waking up in paradise each morning. Club Millésime elevated our experience to an entirely different level. The exclusivity, the curated gourmet bites, the afternoon tea, and evening cocktails — all served with finesse and, once again, the warmth of exceptional staff who remembered our preferences with charming precision. The beachfront location is another crown jewel. Clean, calm, and picturesque — perfect for a morning stroll, a lazy afternoon with cocktails, or a sunset soak in serenity. The beachfront pool and cabanas added an extra layer of luxury to the already lush tropical surroundings. The entire resort is immaculately maintained — every corner exudes elegance, from the grand lobby to the tranquil gardens and winding pathways. Despite its size, it feels intimate and peaceful, thanks to the incredible staff who create a personal connection with each guest. Sofitel Nusa Dua isn’t just a resort — it’s a destination in itself. A place where every detail is refined, every moment is cherished, and every guest is treated like royalty. We left with hearts full and memories we'll treasure for a lifetime. A heartfelt thank you to the entire Sofitel team — you made our stay unforgettable."
"279.","Sean Hipkins","8","2025-06-01","5","Recently stayed at the Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua! We had the absolute best time — the resort is just stunning, and the warmth and care from the team made it extra special. We honestly didn’t want to leave! We’ll be telling all our friends and family that it is the place to stay — we can’t recommend it highly enough. The buffet breakfast is insane, so many food stations to discover. We’re already planning our stay there for next year. As a Platinum member with Accor we received an upgraded room and an invitation to an exclusive cocktail hour meet and greet with the staff, a lovely way to start the holiday. Can't wait for our next visit."

"282.","Lily T","3","2025-08-01","5","I absoloutely loved my stay at the Sofitel Nusa Dua. If anyone is looking for a hotel, I strongly recommend to come here, you will not be disappointed. The staff are so lovely and attentive. When walking past they will greet you and smile. Multiple times during my stay I was amazed by the kindness and genuine helpfullness displayed by all the staff. The amenities are top of the game, for example the AMAZING pool area, the fitness centre, the spa. Having a weekly activities schedule is so thoughtful and fun. The pool is so beyond beautiful and relaxing, with a swim up bar, and many different places to sit and relax. The fitness centre is well equipped, clean, and staff are so attentive and kind in the gym, eagerly leading you to the different sections of the gym. The rooms are so nice and clean. They have everything you could need, and upon arrival they had done a lovely platter of fruits and little sweets as we are an accor member. The member's lounge is so lovely and such a nice place to relax, especially the afternoon tea and cocktail hour was outstanding. The resturants in this resort are delicious, with a wide range of foods and different places to eat, which is great if you are staying for a longer time. I really loved the detail in this hotel, such as having beautifully arranged rocks on the walk to your room. The soaps are top quality. In the bathrooms there were flowers placed on the counter. They gave us gorgous sofitel bracelets when we arrived. The fact that staff made an effort to remember and use our names. Overall, this is the best hotel I have ever been to and I HIGHLY reccomend anyone visiting Bali to stay here. Thankyou so much to the lovely staff who looked after us during our stay ❤️"
"283.","Kevin Häfeli","425","2025-12-18","5","It's my second time at Sofitel Nusa Dua. This time for our honeymoon. I highly recommend the hotel. It's a wonderful place, has great calm beach and the crew is super friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet is amazing with many options. One small downside: the coffee is not super good. If you have a the diamond/platinum status at Accor I recommend to check out the club lounge. It offers a calm breakfast, nice drinks during the day and an apero in the evening. However, paying the upgrade for the access is probably not worth it."
"284.","Phil","118","2025-04-01","5","Excellent beach location and a wonderful modern resort. The staff were simply amazing and made our stay all the more enjoyable and memorable. We were greeted each day by everyone from the moment we left our room until our return with a polite smile and acknowledgement. It is the staff that really make the stay so good, from Michelly at breakfast, Rizky, Josa and Suweta at the pool and Mary and Eka at Toya Beach Bar, all of them and many more were amazing. From check in to check out we couldn’t have been treated any better. We wanted a relaxing holiday and that is what we had, the water both in the pool and in the ocean was magnificent and our early morning walks along the foreshore was wonderful. I even practiced my Qigong on the beach as the sun rose in front of me. I had a 2 hour massage on the lawn and a treatment in the Spa and both were excellent. We will return again without hesitation. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻"

It was the perfect getaway for our family – my wife, my son, and I were blown away by every detail of our stay. The property itself is a stunning oasis, with lush gardens, breathtaking views, and luxurious spaces that we couldn’t get enough of. Our room was spacious and beautifully designed, providing a serene retreat for all of us. We loved waking up to the sound of the ocean and feeling completely at peace in such a beautiful setting. What truly stood out was the exceptional service. Every staff member went out of their way to ensure that our family had everything we needed. My son was especially treated with such care and attention, which made our experience even more special. The kids’ activities were fantastic, and he had the best time exploring all the fun options available, from the pool to the organized games. The dining experience was equally remarkable. We enjoyed every meal – from delicious local specialties to international dishes that suited everyone’s taste. The atmosphere was perfect for a family, and we loved sharing meals together while enjoying the beautiful surroundings. Thank you, Sofitel Bali, for making our family holiday one we will always cherish. The memories we’ve made here will stay with us forever, and we can’t wait to return for another unforgettable experience."

So many names to mention but from the cleaner in the club to the GM ALL AMAZING.

"287.","Thomo Tommy","2","2025-04-01","4","Moved from Seminiyak to Sofitel Nusa Dua and fell in love with the resort and the general location from the very start. Sofitel is a great, world-class resort with superb facilities all-round. Nusa Dua is a beautiful, modern and well planned part of Bali. This is where world leaders have conferences and meetings. Sofitel has a stunning reception area with views of the ocean. We loved our private plunge pool, large and expansive rooms. Unfortunately, my spouse who has a super sense of smell had issues with bad smells possibly coming out of the aircon or somewhere in the room. Our plunge pool had a few uneven tiles showing evidence of post construction repairs. These tiles posed a risk of injury in the pool Our biggest gripe was the Kwee Zeen restaurant where we were having our breakfast and buffet dinner. Kwee Zeen's offerings are a bit underwhelming. The food definitely needs an improvement in terms of variety and quality. Some of the attendants at Kwee Zeen had some challenges with their command of the English language thereby presenting a bit of a communication barrier. Unfortunately, we never had a chance to sample other restuarents such as Cucina restaurant. Manarai Beach house atmosphere was okay but the chicken wings we ordered were just too sweet. In terms of food offering we found the Toya Beach Bar and Grill had better quality than Manarai. The customer service at both Beach venues was excellent. Mey, at Manarai had excellent customer skills . She did welcome us and serve us very well. The guy who served us free ice cream at Toya Beach Bar was also superb. In general the people are great. The manager on duty at during our time was also immaculate. I think his name is Andrei. He handled the issue relating to our broken baggage immaculately. At checkout we were served by Febri who went over and above to make us feel at home. We will definitely come back to Sofitel Nusa Dua, in the hope that we will find better food at other restaurants such as Cucina or Kwee Zeen will have improved."

From the moment of our arrival to the hotel until we checked out, we were treated like VIPs. No guest requests are too insignificant, the staff would do their best to fullfill them. Lisa at the club Millesime reception area is very helpful in answering all of our questions. We even discussed the details of our next holiday back at Sofitel Nusa Dua. The club attendants were all so wonderful; you could feel that they served the guests from the heart. Krisna, our room attendant did an exceptional job in making sure the room was cleaned and refreshed everytime we returned from outdoor activities. We had a very nice dinner at Toya beach bar & grill with a view to the ocean on our last night at the hotel. Our table was taken care of by Eka who was very friendly and energetic. The service was really efficient and professional. We can't wait for our next holiday with our kids at Sofitel Nusa Dua."

From the moment we arrived, the service was flawless – made even more special by the team of butlers who looked after us throughout our stay: Edi, Yudi, Bagus, and Diah. Each of them was kind, humble, attentive, and genuinely dedicated to making our stay unforgettable. They went above and beyond in every way – always anticipating our needs, offering thoughtful touches, and treating our family with warmth and care that felt so personal. Our children especially grew close to Edi, who had a beautiful way of connecting with them. On our final night, he came to say goodbye, and the moment he left, both our daughter and son burst into tears – which in turn made my wife and I teary-eyed as well. It was such a raw and emotional moment that truly showed how special these people had become to us. While it was difficult to leave, we feel incredibly grateful to have been looked after by such beautiful souls. We can’t thank Edi, Yudi, Bagus, and Diah enough for their genuine care and impeccable service. Our family left with full hearts and unforgettable memories. Highly recommend this resort – not just for the luxury, but for the people who make it extraordinary."

Everything was perfect; from the upgrade granted to the birthday girl (including Club Millesime) to the kindness and availability of the staff. The staff helped us arrange a special welcome for the birthday girl, and she was very happy about it. Moreover, the hotel is by the beach, which was great for us to relax even more. As a cherry on the cake, we were granted a really late check-out. Sofitel standards are quite high everywhere, but the Nusa Dua Sofitel was a higher level. The staff is particularly well trained in being polite to the guests and trying to accommodate their requests."

You really did get our needs. The Cucina restaurant is also well worth the experience. The food was amazing. Try the Seafood Gnochi it is the best i have eaten. For real. The resort is relaxed and with so many restaurants and beach activities. You can check in and not have to think till you leave.

I was lost getting to the conference venue and asked a member of staff, he took the time to walk me to the conference room although it was in the opposite direction to where he was going. I dropped my hair scrunchie in the conference on the last day, and returned to the desk in the evening to ask if the cleaning staff found it. Receptionist rang the housekeeping team who said they didn't find anything, the lady then took me into the room to look for it, although it was evening and she spotted it camouflaged next table leg, slightly covered by the black tablecloth. It wasn't an expensive item, it was the only hair tie i had with me, it wasn't a big deal if i lost it. So it was really heart warming that the receptionist took extra effort to help me locate something so small. deeply appreciate the high level of service and personal touch from every staff member. they took pride in what they do and were always smiling and happy to see you, every staff member i walked passed had a smile and greeting."

The staff are so welcoming, from check in to dining to the hallways, there is always a warm smile everywhere you go ☺️ breakfast buffet was endless and delicious! The staff member Mega Kweezeen was very attentive ☺️. The rooms are very nice, the beds are clouds, best sleep in a long time!"
"308.","Christine Misseri","5","2025-07-01","5","Absolutely loved this resort and would recommend to anyone considering a stay here. The pools were a standout, they went for days and surrounded the entire resort, the service, the cleanliness, the rooms and facilites, the restaurants, location, staff kindness...it was all superb. I will definitely stay here again one day if returning to Bali. Highly recommend!! Only drawback if i had to find one was that we felt the kids club appeared a little more focussed on little kids/toddlers and not so much aimed at those 7 and above so we didnt utlise that service as we'd hoped but our kids were not short on entertainment with the extensive pools, beach and activites about."
"309.","Joelle Han-Chu","11","2025-08-01","5","We stayed in the Luxury room of Sofitel, Nusa Dua. Loved our stay immensely. Even if service fell short at times, service recovery was prompt and satisfactory. Only grouse if we have to pick something is that breakfast buffet can get boring if you are stay is extended. Special shout-out to Niti, our housekeeper. She always set the room to exactly how we would like it."
"310.","Joanna Garrard","3","2025-07-01","5","My friends and I got food from the restaurant located by the beach. The food was exquisite, the lamb tasted amazing and the Choc Forest was divine. Erik our server was also really attentive and helpful. Price is more expensive than some but worth the price. Would definitely recommend."

The food was excellent with lots of variety and great taste. We had dinner at kwee zen and cucina. Both resto had varities of delicious foods. We also enjoyed a relaxing massage at the spa—special thanks to Ms. Evi and Ms. Ega for taking such good care of us. While we relaxed, the kids had fun with the treasure hunt game at the kids’ club. The gym and cardio area were top-notch. Overall, a 10/10 experience. We’ll definitely be coming back! A perfect place to enjoy the beauty of Bali"
"313.","Marina Katsilis","7","2025-08-01","5","I love the Sofitel but one of my fave parts of this hotel is the Italian restaurant. Omg this place is amazing the food is incredible I’ve been here so many times and everytime I come it’s seriously amazing. The staff is also incredible Thankyou to our team that served us Yoga and Agus they were amazing. Seriously the best ever."
"314.","Beverley Rawlins","5","2025-07-01","4","Great resort for the most of it. Although most of the staff were just so, so lovely, I have to make special mention to certain staff - Sugi, at the day spa was very attentive and her experience and knowledge in providing the services I had were exceptional. Resmana (sorry if spelling isn't quite right), did a perfect job in setting up our floating breakfast. His attention to detail could not be faulted. Yulyastika, at Toya Restaurant also gave us wonderful and attentive service - thank you so much. The food and view from this restaurant also was on point! The resort had a great vibe and atmosphere. You can find both quiet and action at this resort. Great for young, old, couples and families. As you can see most of my comments are very positive and I am sorry to end on a sour note, but it needs to be mentioned - We bought a package that included access to the Club Lounge that included afternoon tea as well as canapes and cocktails. This is no reflection on the wait staff - they were always courteous and friendly. However the replenishment of food was very poor. Every day we were there it was always running out and very, very slow to be topped up again.There were only 2 hot dishes (both at afternoon tea and evening canapes). They must know how many guests had club lounge access and should cater accordingly. Not only was it the hot food, but even the crackers, cheese etc. Also glasses if you just wanted a soft drink or mineral water. You often had to ask a wait staff for a glass and then wait for them to get you one. Again, no reflection on wait staff. Management should 'manage' this and eyeball the area. Also, staff at the reception desk of the Club Lounge could be taught to 'up' their game. Reception staff in the general area were much better. You would think the best staff would be employed to work at the Club Lounge. We rang up and asked for a late check out and I received a message via WhatsApp, telling us that we just needed to present our room cards to reception and they would update it. We went to Club Lounge Reception and was told by the girl on the desk that we would have to wait till her colleague came back to update card. We just went down to the main foyer and the reception staff there updated the cards in a millisecond. Why couldn't the girl on club lounge reception do it? Then, after we checked out and paid our bill at the Club Lounge Reception, we wanted to wait half an hour in the lounge and just have a cup of coffee or tea (as they said they provide all day refreshments), till our pick up to the airport arrived. We were told we weren't allowed as we had now checked out or she would have to check with her manager. If we had known that, we would have had our cup of coffee and then checked out. I mean really....if you pay that price for club lounge access!! We were dumbfounded and left the lounge as we weren't going to plea for a cup of coffee and sitting there for half an hour. I later went back to provide feedback! They said there was miscommunication. I've played it back in my head and we definitely said we just wanted to kill half an hour in there. Anyway, that's my rant. Some guests are well to do and expect exceptional service in a Club Lounge and for some guests, it's a very special treat, but also expect special treatment if you are paying for it. This is a 5 star resort and greater attention to finer details needs to be a given! I recently heard a quote - Luxury is having more than what you asked for, given to you without asking. I think management should take this on board and train reception staff and supervisors (food & beverage) at Club Lounge accordingly."

"316.","Terry Chang","30","2025-08-01","4","We recently stayed at Sofitel and experienced both the Prestige Suite and the Luxury Room, giving us a comprehensive view of the hotel’s offerings. 1. Prestige Suite The Prestige Suite was spacious and beautifully designed — we truly enjoyed the size and comfort. However, we encountered a few issues during our stay. The tile flooring can be dangerously slippery when stepping out of the shower or bathtub; my wife nearly slipped. Additionally, we noticed cockroaches in the room, which was concerning. The suite was located at the far end of the beach, making it a long walk back from the main hotel facilities. Being on the second floor without a nearby lift also meant climbing stairs frequently, which was inconvenient. 2. Luxury Room We later moved to a Luxury Room on the ground floor next to the lift for easier access. While more conveniently located, this room was significantly smaller, and sound insulation was a major issue. We could clearly hear noises from upstairs, adjoining rooms, and even doorbells and doors closing nearby, which affected our rest. Breakfast Experience We tried breakfast twice at Kwee Zeen but were disappointed both times. On one occasion, a guest screamed upon seeing cockroaches running near the fresh food area. Some food items were not fresh and had a noticeable odor. After that, we chose to dine at the Club Lounge instead, where the quality of food and service was considerably better. Checkout Experience Despite holding Accor Platinum status and confirming a 4 PM late checkout upon arrival, our room key stopped working after breakfast on our final day. When I approached the front desk at 12:20 PM, I was told I had to check out by 1 PM because I hadn’t requested late checkout the night before — something I have never encountered at any other Accor property. The rushed packing and abrupt end to our stay disrupted our plans and left us with a poor final impression. Safety Concerns The lobby floor can be hazardous when wet. During one cleaning session, water pooled on the tiles, I was almost fell over, but my young son wasn't lucky, he slipped and hit his head on the floor. There was no warning signage coming from the room side, only the sinage coming from the lobby, which was quite alarming. The staff who were cleaning just stopped the machine but they didn't warn us about how slippery the floor was. Dining & Accor Discount Issues Another issue we noticed across multiple restaurants was inconsistency with the Accor Plus dining discount. Staff would take a photo of our membership card and state a 50% discount applied, but they failed to mention that children’s meals were excluded. Moreover, the discount often wasn’t applied correctly on the bill, requiring us to request adjustments and present our card again. This happened more than once, indicating a lack of training or attention to detail. Overall Impression While the Sofitel property has its strengths, especially in room design and Club Lounge service, the inconsistencies in service quality, cleanliness, safety, and management of loyalty privileges left us disappointed. There is clear room for improvement, particularly in hospitality training, hygiene standards, and honoring elite member benefits."
"317.","Christian Kublins","1","2025-08-01","5","Our family stayed at Sofitel Nusa Dua on our recent (and first) trip to Bali. The resort was fantastic; clean, well laid out, great pools and restaurants as well as first class service. They made our trip very relaxed and comfortable."

We had our dinner and breakfast at KWEE ZEEN Nusa Dua. The food was delicious with great variety. We had the beach spa massage which was a terrible experience. It was windy and had no privacy. The masseuse asked us to take our clothes off in the public area without closing the blinds. They didn’t wash our feet before messaging from our feet to our face. Loud music and people walking by during the whole massage. We couldn’t relax at all…😵"
"321.","Putra Karbon","39","2025-05-01","5","Our stay was fantastic, with excellent service from check-in to check-out. We were particularly impressed by the friendly and helpful front office, Food & Beverage, and housekeeping teams. The room temperature was perfect. We will definitely be returning in the future. The only area for improvement we noted was at Club Millésime. The air conditioning seemed to need attention, as it was quite warm during both afternoon tea and Apéro Chic. Thank you, and have a great day!"

The hotel's amenities exceeded expectations, from the beautifully designed rooms to the spa and gourmet dining options. Every detail was thoughtfully curated to ensure a seamless and luxurious stay. What truly set this experience apart was the outstanding customer service! The staff went above and beyond, anticipating our needs before we even had to ask, making us feel genuinely valued and cared for.

Lastly; the service from everybody was beyond expectation, every staff was so courteous and helpful. it was mind blowing that all the staff was well mannered and polite. It was the best hotel out of our 3 hotels in Bali, we will definitely be back!"
"324.","Ven Ven","3","2025-05-01","5","I stayed at Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for 1 night. In terms of security and comfort the hotel environment was very good. In terms of the room was also clean, spacious and very comfortable, I really like the condition of the room, the design of the room, the view from the room, the placement of furniture in the room, and etc. I was also grateful and thankful because the hotel has provided a non-slippery mat that makes My Mom more comfortable when taking a shower. Regarding the location, it was a bit far from the crowd because Sofitel Nusa Dua Beach Hotel is in a separate complex with quite good security (must go through 2x inspection gates) 1 thing that would be a note in my memory. I just realized that Sofitel Nusa Dua Beach did not provide Room Service for Dinner and there was no Breakfast when Easter (Black Out Date), I do not know whether the information was conveyed to me because I stayed using a complementary voucher from All Accor or it was generally like that, because when I checked out (Easter day) around 10.30 - 11.00 WIB, I found many foreign tourists arriving at the lobby of the Sofitel Nusa Dua Beach hotel and according to information from the hotel staff, some of them wanted to order Brunch. I really regret that happened to us, considering that my mother and I deliberately did not bring food from outside because we wanted to taste the hotel's culinary delights. However, precisely because we stayed with a complementary voucher from ALL Accor we were given information that we could not order dinner in the room, please go directly to the restaurant. And considering that we checked in quite tired because we were stuck in traffic on the way from Tanah Lot to the hotel (it was already 7:00 at night), we were too lazy to go out again to find food and in the morning we hurriedly packed up and checked out early to have breakfast outside. I have stayed in 5-star hotels like Sofitel Nusa Dua Beach several times , but it was the first experience Room Service for dinner was not available and Breakfast was also closed considering Easter (black out date). I intended to ask further when I saw the menu instructions on the TV and the menu book in the room regarding breakfast and room service options, but in the end I canceled that intention."

"330.","Christine Rose","5","2025-06-01","5","From the moment we checked in I felt like royalty. The staff sat us in a beautiful lounge, offered us cold towels and juice while they sorted all the check in and luggage. Upon entering our room, they had two teddies as gifts for our children which was such a lovely touch. The kids were given a hotel passport that took them on a journey around the resort offering free food, drinks and manicures. The kids club was like an Australian daycare, setup with lots of carers to watch the kids so we could have some alone time and truly enjoy having a break. Our room came with a Butler, who would introduce themselves every morning and afternoon making sure our stay was enjoyable offering to help in any way. The daily breakfast buffet was so delicious!! lots of choices from different types of foods so everyone had something they enjoyed. The massive bed was extremely comfortable which is a make or break for hotels, I didn't want to get out of bed! The beach front restaurant was beautiful, we had our mums 60th party there and it was magical watching my parents dance with their grandkids in the sand. I couldn't recommend this resort enough, especially for families. When I return to Bali, it will be back here!"
"331.","Reza Nugraha","167","2025-07-01","5","Sofitel Nusa Dua offers a refined blend of modern French elegance and Balinese charm. From the grand lobby to the sprawling pool and beautifully landscaped grounds, the entire resort exudes majesty and polish. As an Accor Platinum member, I truly appreciated the warm welcome and status recognition at check-in. Although the hotel was fully booked and I didn’t receive a room upgrade, the staff made every effort to ensure a smooth and pleasant stay. One of the highlights was the Club Millésime lounge—a quiet, elegant space where service was attentive and the food consistently delicious. From breakfast to evening canapés, every bite felt thoughtfully prepared and beautifully presented. A perfect place to unwind in comfort and privacy. The rest of the resort lived up to Sofitel’s high standards: a spectacular pool, well-equipped fitness center, and sleek, comfortable rooms with tasteful design elements. Whether relaxing on the grounds or heading out to explore, everything felt effortless and indulgent. Despite the full occupancy, Sofitel Nusa Dua delivered a luxurious and relaxing stay, with heartfelt service, fantastic food, and a setting that feels both grand and personal."

Just like our previous stay, everything was flawless from the moment we arrived. A heartfelt thank you to Andrie Kapitan, the wonderful Front Office Manager and the front office team, for the very generous room upgrade – our suite was stunning, spacious, and beautifully presented. It truly made our anniversary feel extra special. We’d also love to express our appreciation to the incredible staff across the entire resort – from the bell desk, reception, housekeeping, to the bar and restaurant teams. Every single staff member we encountered was warm, professional, and genuinely caring. While I unfortunately don’t know everyone’s name, please know that you all made a lasting impression – you’re the soul of the resort. Special thanks as well to Putra from the Wedding Sales team, who kindly took the time to show us the venue and walk us through all the details about the wedding packages. Also thanks to the lovely spa and massage team for their amazing work specially Dewi. Thank you so much! And of course – the food! Absolutely amazing, especially at Cucina.

Apart from this, warn welcome by Sofitel upon arrival and staff real friendly and efficient actually. Never failed to attend to us as I have two old folks with me. Room is real spacious and gracefully maintained. Bed is SO big and comfy. Linen and towels are good quality kind and new. At least in 2024. Room with a nice view facing sea, Sitting at the balcony, listening to the sea breeze and looking beach side massage, very relaxing. A wide variety of tv channels and full amenity toiletries provided. Bath tub is huge too with complimentary bubble bath and bath salt provided. Actually not much options of asean option restaurants, mostly western. However, Room service has both western and asean food. Food taste not too bad, portion just right. Free shuttle service to bali collection on a hourly basis but first come first service basis. Huge hotel and they provided buggy service within hotel premises. All these are plus point after a tired day. Still I enjoyed my stay with Sofitel despite the hiccups which I was told is entire bali power trip. So I don’t blame them."

Eventhough we had slightly disagreement through an email with the Reservation team and Concierge but it's all paid off. A special shout out to Edi from Housekeeping, who prepared the most thoughtful surprise in our room. It was beautifully arranged, with such personal touches that truly warmed our hearts. Every day, our room was immaculate and inviting, and Edi’s quiet dedication made our stay feel truly special. Also, a big thank you to May from the Front Office. Traveling with two young daughters can be a handful, but May went above and beyond to make sure everything was smooth right from the start. Her kindness, patience, and attention to detail made us feel like we were staying with family. From start to finish, the entire Sofitel team made our stay memorable. The pool was a big hit (our kids didn’t want to leave!), and the sunrise views were simply breathtaking truly a perfect escape. We’d also like to extend our appreciation to Annisa and the Guest Experience team, as well as the restaurant staff especially Micellyn, Rama, the gentleman who served our coffee, and the kitchen staff behind the delicious meals.

From the moment we arrived, Yudi greeted us with a warm smile and made us feel right at home. The ambiance of the restaurant was lovely, but it was Yudi's attentive service that truly elevated our dining experience. He checked in on us regularly, ensuring we had everything we needed without being intrusive. His genuine passion for providing excellent service shone through, making our evening feel special. The food itself was exquisite! Each dish was beautifully presented and bursting with flavour. If you're looking for a memorable dining experience in Bali, I highly recommend visiting Kwee Zeen and asking for Yudi Permana.

"344.","Ash Robinson","8","2025-03-01","3","Very large resort but unless you tipped service was not great. Check in took a long time, not getting our room but getting served in general was about 30min+. Then we didn’t get showed to our room just pointed in the general direction and for a large resort was a bit overwhelming on first arrival. Some of the food was fantastic some not so great and if you are using luxury escape vouchers through their deal you have limitations unless you pay extra. We also felt that we were treated less using our vouchers. As the saying goes money talks. The resort is starting to show its age, our room smelt wet/mouldy and had an air purifier in it so it is a known problem. Our room was clean and well presented but we did have to ask for our sheets to be changed on 4th day. Was very hard to communicate with staff especially reception as they don’t understand English that well. Overall we wouldn’t recommend this resort for the price, it is a relaxing resort with some beautiful grounds and great access to beach but be willing to pay extra to receive good service."

The hotel and the location were amazing, the hotel was beautiful and vast. Asíh, our room cleaner was fantastic and always kept our room spotless. The beach was beautiful, unfortunately not enough sun loungers though. My main points of contention was that there wasn’t any A.C in the breakfast room, so every morning, it was uncomfortably humid and there wasn’t enough standing fans in the room."

In particular, OKA from the concierge team took care of us with great attention, which made us feel truly special. If we visit Bali again, I would definitely choose Sofitel once more."

From the moment we were greeted in the Lobby to the warmest greeting at the Lounge, we were looked after by the amazing staff. All staff were very attentive remembering our names and always went above and beyond to ensure we had a great experience. Our upgrade to a pool swim out room and late check out was very much appreciated and we were very happy."

A notable experience I had this morning was at breakfast at KweeZween, included in our package, which encompasses a market-style structure with different stations of high quality food. We were served by Mega who was so kind and even patiently taught us Balinese. She was very attentive to our needs and made us feel very welcome!"

"353.","Sagar Nagda","3","2025-06-01","5","I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Sofitel Nusa Dua, and I must say, it was an unforgettable experience from start to finish. Every aspect of the resort, from the lounge and restaurant to the kids’ play area and pool, was thoughtfully designed to provide maximum comfort, luxury, and enjoyment. Lounge Experience The lounge at Sofitel Nusa Dua is a perfect blend of elegance and relaxation. Upon entering, I was immediately impressed by the sophisticated décor and the calming ambiance. The seating was plush and comfortable, ideal for unwinding after a day of exploring. The staff were exceptionally attentive and friendly, always ready with a warm smile and prompt service. The selection of beverages and light snacks was impressive, featuring both local flavors and international favorites. Whether for a casual coffee or an evening cocktail, the lounge provided a serene environment to relax and socialize. Yuli and Tai at front desk were amazing. Kristina and Mat at minestrone club were best, Restaurant Dining Dining at Sofitel Nusa Dua was nothing short of spectacular. Dinesh the chef understood our veg needs properly. The restaurant offered a diverse menu that catered to a variety of tastes, from authentic Balinese dishes to international cuisine. Each meal was a culinary delight, beautifully presented and bursting with flavor. The fresh ingredients and creative combinations truly showcased the chef’s expertise. The ambiance was elegant yet inviting, with attentive staff who ensured that every dining experience was memorable. Breakfast buffets were particularly impressive, offering a wide array of options to start the day right. Kids Play Area Traveling with children can sometimes be challenging, but the kids’ play area at Sofitel Nusa Dua made the stay incredibly enjoyable for my little ones. The play area was safe, clean, and creatively designed to keep children entertained for hours. It featured a variety of toys, games, and activities that stimulated their imagination and energy. What I appreciated most was the staff’s genuine care and supervision, allowing parents to relax knowing their children were in good hands. It was a wonderful space that balanced fun and safety perfectly. Pool Facilities The pool area at Sofitel Nusa Dua was a true highlight of the resort. Surrounded by lush tropical gardens, the pools offered a refreshing escape from the tropical heat. The water was crystal clear and well-maintained, with ample loungers and shaded areas for relaxation. Whether I wanted to swim laps or simply lounge by the water with a cocktail, the pool area provided the perfect setting. The poolside service was impeccable, with attentive staff ensuring that drinks and snacks were always within reach. It was an oasis of tranquility and luxury. Final Thoughts My stay at Sofitel Nusa Dua was an extraordinary experience that exceeded all expectations. The combination of luxurious amenities, exceptional service, and family-friendly facilities made it a perfect destination for both relaxation and fun. I highly recommend this resort to anyone looking for a sophisticated yet welcoming getaway in Bali. Whether you’re traveling solo, as a couple, or with family, Sofitel Nusa Dua promises a memorable and delightful stay. I look forward to returning soon!"

Yes the room was looking a bit tired, with broken tiles, but they were spotless and clean. The food at all the dining options was beautiful. You need to promote your day spa more and celebrate your win of 2024!. All the guest that I talked with had no idea that they had won such award. The day spa was next level and could understand why they had won this incredible award."

"359.","Mohammed Nasr","10","2025-06-01","2","I had a deeply disappointing experience at Sofitel Nusa Dua, which ultimately led me to check out before the end of my stay. The property feels outdated and in need of serious refurbishment — it certainly does not meet the expectations of a 5-star resort. Nearly every amenity came with an additional charge, which was not clearly communicated upfront. On top of that, all prices were listed before tax, making costs feel misleading. For a resort under the Sofitel name, I expected a much higher standard of quality, service, and transparency."

The pool and beach area were comfortable and well-maintained, perfect for relaxation. The food was delicious, with excellent breakfast options that offered a great variety of dishes.

The restaurant is also huge and has some delicious food. They provided really nice toiletries, the brand (LOCCITANE) and it smelled awesome. The beds and the bathroom were really big as well. The price was a bit much but it was totally worth it. Overall I definitely recommend it."

"371.","Jay Hothi","10","2025-07-01","1","Really disappointed with my experience in this hotel, which is unlike anything I have experienced at a 'high end' hotel before. We were checked in by Ricky, whose service and demeanour was outstanding. He was kind, friendly and helpful. Unfortunately that was the highlight of our two-night stay. We requested some washing up liquid to clean our baby's bottles - this was denied initially as 'something they just do not have'; when it was pointed out that they must have this to clean dishes in the kitchen, the story changed from 'this is something we do not provide', to 'this is not safe for babies' to 'it goes against our standard operating procedures to provide this'. The receptionist even suggested (at 10 at night) 'oh you should go out and buy some' - a service worth paying thousands for indeed (!). The final straw was after it was requested, and we were told we would receive an update, somebody knocked three times on my door at 10pm despite us explicitly telling reception not to do this, that the baby was asleep, and because of them we have no way of feeding her milk if she wakes up. She did indeed wake up with the knocking and would not be settled without her milk as we only had dirty bottles. We have stayed in a number of hotels around the world and never experienced anything like this - the excuses, the lack of helpfulness and just overall the stubborness and unwillingness. Something so basic that could have helped us out, and no real reason for not being willing to do so. Will not be back."
"372.","MSPS Adelaide Printing","66","2025-05-01","1","Worst Hotel Experience in Bali This was the worst hotel out of the three we stayed at during our trip — Ayana and Alaya in Ubud were far better in every way. Service was poor from the start. Staff didn’t greet guests, check-in was slow, and even after it was done, our room wasn’t ready. We came back after 3 hours and still had to wait another 25 minutes just to get the key. The hotel either doesn’t have enough staff or they’re just poorly managed. Only two people were handling check-ins while three others stood around opening doors and serving drinks and even that was slow~!!! took 10min to get our welcome drink — not acceptable. Breakfast was another letdown — overcrowded and low quality. Sadly, I also had stomach issues and diarrhea after our stay, which speaks to the hygiene standards. Would definitely not recommend. Major disappointment!!!"

"378.","Lauren Mulligan","3","2025-08-01","1","My fiancé and I were booked to attend the Sofitel in mid August and my fiancé has sadly had a motorbike accident resulting in 2 surgeries, weeks in hospital and a long rehabilitation process. Unable to make our booking I had tried reaching out to the hotel to ask if we could simply move our booking, more than happy to pay more to cover a change in rate and were met with the disappointing message that whilst they were sorry they would not allow us to change our booking date. Whilst I am aware that we booked with a no cancellation policy, I was not asking to cancel the booking or asking for a refund or compensation of any kind. I simply wanted to move our booking to later in the year so that would could finally have some downtime in what has been an incredibly hard time for us. To be met with we completely understand how disappointing and stressful it must be to we inform you that the terms and conditions associated with your booking remain applicable - even after sending documentation of hospital stays and surgery info highlighting the extent of my fiancé's severe injuries; is nothing short of heart-breaking. We have stayed at many other Sofitel branches before and have always been so happy with the service; one of the main reasons we booked to stay here when visiting Bali. We are incredibly disappointed in the Sofitel and will not be staying at the chain in the future."

"385.","Nicolas","405","2025-01-01","4","Overall a great hotel. Fantastic breakfast, great rooms and nice staff. The pool / private beach space is quite big and it almost feels like paradise. Only 2 issues we encountered during our 1 week stay: -there is a beach club almost inside the hotel but with different management. It’s great and we went there for lunch on most days but one day they had a crazy party from 3pm to 11 with extremely loud bass that I could hear clearly from my room even with closed windows. -kids. Way too many kids. If you want to relax near the main pool forget about it there will be kids screaming most of the times. If you think you’re smart and go near the second small pool with no kids, well some families seating near the main pool will decide to go with their kids in this one instead to scream and jump for some reason. I would happily have paid twice what I paid if this was an adult only resort, the kids were annoying to the point we had to go to another hotel pool some days to relax. Either get rid of all kids or put some adult only rules in one of the pools."

It was very strong and difficult to sleep with each night. Sofitel’s solution was to try and cover smell with extremely strong smelling bathroom spray and put a dehumidifier in the room then get you signed up to their affiliate program to give you $20 credit as compensation so you are welcome to spend more money with them. Very poor management and very disappointing for an expensive stay at a supposedly 5* resort. Fobbed us off for apparently not complaining quite enough. Manager said it’s just a problem because of humid weather in Bali however none of the other places we stayed in or visited had this problem. Just get your ac cleaned Sofitel Nusa Dua!"

"406.","Vania Olivia","1","2025-05-01","1","Mohon maaf apabila ada kritik yang kurang sesuai, saya hanya menyampaikan apa yang saya rasakan selama 3 malam (9 April - 12 April) di Sofitel Nusa Dua Bali. Saya hanya ingin membagikan cerita saya selama berada di Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua, mengingat saya sebagai tamu yang membayar 3-4juta per malam berhak untuk menceritakan apa yang saya rasakan. Saya menginap di Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua malam pertama dan ketiga saya ambil Stay Plus Keanggotaan Accor saya, beberapa bulan lalu mama saya membayar Keanggotaan Accor Plus senilai 5 juta++ mendapatkan 2 x Voucher Stay Plus jadi malam pertama dan ketiga saya hanya membayar 605 ribu dan saya membayar 3juta++ untuk malam keduanya. Saya menginap 3 malam, malam pertama dan kedua di kamar 1308 di building 1 lantai 3, saya tidak bisa tidur di kamar ini dan baru tidur jam 4 pagi sehabis subuh, mulai jam 18.30 akan banyak gangguan ketika malam tiba, suara tangisan, bau melati yang seriwingann, banyak bayangan sekelebatan yang lewat, di dalam bathub kamar mandi seperti peti yang didalamnya ada orang yang tidur, di akhirnya malam ketiga saya minta pindah dan diberikan kamar 5218 di building 5 lantai 2, dan saya baru bisa tidur dengan nyenyak. 1. Pelayanan sangat baik, malam pertama saya komplain tidak bisa tidur dan ingin membatalkan pesanan (pindah hotel), manager hotel datang mengajak ngobrol dan membawakan lampu tembak yang membuat kamar menjadi jauh lebih terang, malam ketiga saya kembali ingin pindah hotel dan membatalkan pesanan pada malam ketiga, dan kembali di handle dengan sangat baik, ditawarkan pindah kamar ke kamar 5218, pelayanan bintang 5, Terimakasih manager dan staff hotel Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua. 2. Mengingat rasa makanan nya yang kurang cocok dilidah, saya memesan makanan via GrabFood/GoFood, dan saya berharap pihak resepsionis pada lobby hotel dapat dititipkan makanan oleh driver ojek online karena jarak kamar dan lobby yang cukup jauh sehingga perlu waktu sekitar 15-30 menit berjalan kaki (karena tidak seperti di Apurva Kempinski Hotel yang menyediakan Buggy Car, atau mungkin saya saja yang tidak mendapatkan pelayanan Buggy Car tersebut) untuk mengambil pesanan GrabFood/GoFood, menurut saya sangat kasian jika driver GoFood/GrabFood harus menunggu 15-30 menit sampai pesanan diambil tamu hotel yang memesan makanan, terlepas dari lama, juga driver Grab/GoFood tidak dapat mengambil orderan dari orang lain yang mungkin masuk ketika menunggu tamu hotel mengambil pesanannya. 3. Walaupun pelayanannya bintang 5, namun responsif dari pihak customer service sangat lamaa, saya meminta seseorang datang ke kamar saya untuk membantu membawakan koper ketika checkout, 30 menit tidak kunjung datang, akhirnya saya membawa sendiri koper-koper saya tersebut dari building 5 ke Lobby yang sangat jauh itu (mengingat hak kita sebagai tamu hotel bintang 5 dengan harga 3-4 juta per malam) 4. Mama saya adalah anggota accorplus dimana diperbolehkan meminta late checkout, dan saya hanya meminta late checkout jam 1 siang (mengingat pesawat saya jam 4 sore), diperbolehkan namun diawal customer service nya menginformasikan ketentuan checkout hotel jam 11 pagi (sepemahaman saya dimana-mana ketentuan checkout hotel berbintang 5 adalah jam 12 siang). 5. Saya cukup kecewa dengan beberapa staff hotel yang tidak konsisten dalam memberikan informasi, tanggal 10 April saya menanyakan kepada salah satu staff akses menuju pantai, dan diinformasikan bahwa dapat menggunakan Buggy Car. Namun, ketika keesokan harinya saya mau melihat pantai bersama mama saya, dan saya menanyakan pada staff lain akses menuju pantai, saya diminta untuk berjalan kaki menyusuri restoran, kolam renang hotel, taman, baru sampai di pantai yang menurut saya tidak seindah pantai di Apurva Kempinski Hotel, mengingat harganya yang tidak berbeda jauh."
"407.","Glen Pearce","236","2025-01-01","4","The location of the hotel, within a gated society and the expanse of the hotel itself is impressive. The hotel itself initially presents very well. The gardens and surrounds are green and luscious. A standout feature for us was the genuinely pleasant and helpful staff, like Radit of concierge even remembering us by name. However, some aspects of the hotel and rooms are a bit dated and not well maintained and/or clean. Also, and perhaps most disappointing for us having arrived prior to check in was that there are no facilities for parents/baby changing rooms or tables. With a property of this size, surely this could be easily rectified. We were not the only young family staying at this property so it would be interesting to know what the other families thought about this absent amenity."
"408.","Taylor Pullen","141","2025-01-01","2","We have stayed at Sofitel Nusa Dua five times since 2018, and while we initially loved this resort, the standard of service has sadly declined with each visit. Regrettably, this recent stay will likely be our last. The rooms remain beautifully designed and comfortable, showcasing the luxury you’d expect from a Sofitel property. However, small but impactful oversights, like a missing chair at our dining table, made simple activities like having a meal with my partner unnecessarily awkward. We noticed there are now no longer snacks offered in the mini bad and drink selections have been reduced. We also had problems with hot water and the lock on the back door to our plunge pool room was broken making it possible for anyone to walk into our room. The most noticeable issue, however, is with the food and beverage service. It’s apparent that a large portion of the staff consists of daily workers, and unfortunately, this has led to a lack of organization. During the Christmas brunch, for example, we waited 45 minutes for drinks, and 30 minutes for a coffee the following morning at breakfast. the table service felt rushed and impersonal—hardly what you’d expect from a 5-star resort. Also sad to see chipped and cracked plates at the buffet. Sofitel Nusa Dua still has a lot of potential, but the service standards and attention to detail need significant improvement to justify themselves as a 5 star resort. For now, we’ll be looking elsewhere for our next holiday."

A big thank you to all the staff members there. Our housekeeper, Wedana, was also amazing. He made different animals from towels every day for our kids. Thank you for taking such great care of us. We’ll always cherish our family moments from Bali."
"410.","MickMcM","7","2025-05-01","2","Our rooms were not ready on arrival, we were told to go to the bar and wait (we have 3 children under 8), finally we were sent a message that our rooms were ready, which was 2 hours later. Once we arrived back at reception, the staff asked us to take a seat and wait as they were busy. After a while, we approached an empty desk where the lady explained she was busy, we basically told her to sort it out, which she did ( it took less than 2 mins). The rooms are very basic. This is the 1st place in Bali that hasn't felt like Bali. The staff were very rude at reception and at the poolside cafe. Both tables they seated us at had tables that hadn't been cleaned and had broken chairs."
"411.","Alexander Bont","81","2025-02-01","5","This hotel absolutely blew us away! The entrance was incredibly grand, and the staff were the friendliest and most helpful we've ever encountered. The gym was top-notch, and the pool was an absolute dream. Our room was spacious and even had a bath overlooking the beach – pure bliss! We can't wait to return."
"412.","Alex Harris","6","2025-04-01","5","We stayed 7 nights at the Sofitel for our honeymoon and had the most amazing time. Our room was air conditioned, gorgeously decorated, we had a private plunge pool which was incredible, and the king sized bed was the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in. All of the staff were so friendly and helpful, our room was cleaned and reset daily, the free buffet breakfast every morning was awesome - all different types of cuisine and the coffee was very good. The restaurants on site were excellent, especially Cucina, and Manarai (pool/beach club) was very cool. The swim-up bar was an awesome experience. We will absolutely be coming back - thank you!"
"413.","OMPRAKASH VARMA","33","2025-07-01","5","Room toilet door are not properly designed. Resturant menu for indians has limited option. Stayed from 22to27-2025 (five nights). Breakfast menu is excellent"
"414.","L","8","2025-01-01","5","Stayed for 6 nights in 2023. Room upgrade upon check-in. Room was clean and spacious with private pool that the kids really enjoyed. Amenities were excellent and they also sent a cake with special message for a celebration during our stay. Amazing service especially at the lounge. Kids club is rather small and perhaps caters more for very young children."
"415.","Katherine Ding","7","2025-02-01","5","We loved our stay at the Sofitel. The entire resort is pristine and beautiful. Our room was immaculately clean on arrival and serviced so well during our stay by De Agus who always made sure we had everything we needed and dropped by each evening to see if we needed anything extra. The restaurants on site offer a great variety of food and the breakfast buffet is delicious. The resort beach front is so clean and lovely to sit and relax - we enjoyed an early dinner from the beach grill while watching the sunset. The pool is fantastic with plenty of sun lounges, a swim up bar and designated kids area. There are plenty of things for kids to do with a kids club onsite. Overall the resort is a lovely place to stay - it is more peaceful and refined than others we dropped into during our stay, which we loved. The staff overall are amazing and nothing is ever too much trouble."

"419.","S Heslop","9","2025-10-01","2","Unfortunately the food was not up to a five star hotel standard which was disappointing.. staff were incredible.. location on the beach was stunning, just need to fix the food."
"420.","Thomas Schuette","10","2025-03-01","5","Staff are great, friendly and always willing to help. We had a pool access room with club access. The room was nice and the bed very comfortable. We had plenty of drinking water supplied. We stayed here for our 21st Wedding anniversary and communicated this during our reservation which was acknowledged by the hotel. We did have some little pastries with a happy anniversary note in our room. However, considering the cost of the room per night, having a bottle of champagne would have been a nicer touch. The Sofitel in Adelaide provided this. We were in block E (6000 room numbers). This is closer to the beach but also in line with the kids pool. Very early you hear the kids screaming in the pool. Suggest to request a room in line with restaurant that has a pool table. Its quiet. If you choose a room in 1000 range then you get the morning breakfast restaurant house. If nothing bothers you, then ignore the above. It's a nice hotel but sitting in the club you could be in any hotel in the world. There is nothing giving a touch of Bali. If you stay in the Grand Club at the Grand Hyatt further down, you can see what I mean. A touch of Bali with a high end experience. If none of this is important to you then the Sofitel is fine. Would we stay again, no. Not because it's a bad hotel, it's very compact with alot of rooms and can get overwhelming with so many guests around."
"421.","Alana","2","2025-09-01","5","Great place to stay, the staff cannot do enough to make sure you are happy. Wikan especially! We will definitely be back! 😊"
"422.","Amanda Raiti","15","2025-02-01","1","We stayed for 7 nights in a pool plunge room, the fridge did not work, there was mould, the shower head did not work, no one told us we had to empty the water out of the room humidifier, the food in all the restaurants (except breakfast) was awful. The staff were very polite but that was the only positive. I have stayed in the Sofitel at Fiji which was absolutely beautiful and well worth the money, this was not worth $800.00 per night and I would not classify this room as Deluxe."
"423.","Mario Hadiwinata","31","2025-04-01","3","I’ve been to this hotel 10 years ago, visiting again this week and can see the gap. Service are still excellent, but pool looks dirty, and I got a room near the beach club so you can hear a house music at 11pm under your blanket. The beach service also different now, no one prepares the seat and offer you a towel. On lazy saturday, you can “enjoy” the relaxing beach with house music from beach club beside the private beach. 🥲🥂l"
"424.","Ruchita Agarwal","8","2025-04-01","2","We chose to stay at Sofitel Nusa Dua for our honeymoon. The property is very nice. But my experience was not so good. I booked a package for room and a spa as I wanted a relaxing day on the last day of our honeymoon. At hotel, they told they can only offer massage at beach and not at their ‘So Spa’ centre and It will cost me extra for the ambience of the Spa center for the same massage. It was not clearly mentioned in the details at the time of booking (added screenshot). It was way too hot and humid to take the massage at the beach in open. I was not very comfortable. Spa is all about experience was and for me it was ruined. I had to take the massage in my hotel room bed (not even a massage bed was offered). The bed was bouncy for the massage and I had difficulty breathing entire time as I couldn’t put my neck properly in the hotel room bed. This was not the experience i expected from a five star hotel. Very disappointing."

Massage /spa services were also fantastic. Not sure how well the employees get paid but you should consider paying them better especially the butlers , spa staff and buggy drivers as they made our trip easier , more fun and this has ensured we would only stay at the Sofitel if ever visiting Nusa dua ."
"427.","Angelheart","19","2025-01-01","5","Luxurious facilities, fabulous food and drinks, lovely staff and service - a super-decadent, very relaxing stay. Club Millesime is excellent and the pool-access room was superb. We were concerned the Sunday brunch might not be the same after the 'revamping' but it is still amazing. A lovely experience overall."
"428.","Justin McHugh","11","2025-06-01","5","We stayed at this hotel approximately 6 months ago. Our room attendants were Mario and Raka who were wonderful, the room was well maintained everyday. The hotel was fantastic with facilities to keep the family entertained everyday."
"429.","Wendy Little","3","2025-01-01","5","We found the resort beautiful. Very high standards are taken throughout. The Breakfast Buffet is the best I've ever been to. It has absolutely everything you can think of and as fresh as ever. We had dinner at both restaurant's, and they were both beautiful. The only criticism I could give was that the air conditioner gave a musky smell which Ide say was more from the humidity in the air but once you opened the sliding door and let some fresh air in, it tended to keep it better. The staff were all very friendly and went above and beyond to accommodate us. Highly recommend this resort."

"432.","Lolla Candra","3","2025-01-01","5","I had the pleasure of experiencing the Chic Picnic at Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort last Wednesday, 7 August 2024, and it was truly delightful. The setting was perfect—a beautifully arranged picnic right on the beach, offering stunning views and a serene atmosphere. The food was exceptional, with a variety of delicious options that catered to every palate, and the service was top-notch, with attentive staff ensuring everything was just right. The picnic is available daily through reservation, making it easy to plan this unique experience. With only one table available for up to six guests, it felt exclusive and intimate, perfect for a special gathering with friends or family. I highly recommend it for anyone looking to enjoy a luxurious yet relaxed day by the sea."
"433.","Tony Izzet","38","2025-03-01","5","Perfect and relaxing! The breakfast and dinner buffet options are excellent, catering to all tastes. The staff are incredibly kind and attentive—I had a great conversation with one of them about Balinese culture, and they even remembered my name, greeting me warmly each time I passed by. The bed was unbelievably comfortable—I fell asleep instantly! The room was modern, spacious, and beautifully designed. The pool area and gym facilities were fantastic, adding to the overall luxury experience. I truly wish I had stayed longer. The only downside? The Wi-Fi could have been faster."
"434.","Aditi Nanavaty","77","2025-07-01","2","The check in process was extremely slow despite having done our online check in as well. She just kept repeating the same things and was the slowest check in person. We were upgraded but there were maintenance issues in the room - the phone was not working, a glass was missing and later at night we had a cockroach walking on the bed. Thankfully we were just here for a night as we had an early morning flight out! There are many hotels in Bali that money can be spent on. Awful experience."

Bland, expensive, so westernised it’s unrecognisable, for the price you pay, eat elsewhere! It’s truly shocking that a resort that charges so much can treat their guests to such rubbish and pass it off as cuisine! Woeful ! A special mention to Mediani who took care of us at breakfast and at the Bali night dinner, who was so kind and helpful Also to our fabulous room attendant Alh Adhya who kept our room clean, tidy and well stocked at all times, thank you. Also a very big thank you to all the wonderful staff in Club Millesime, too many to mention, who were so lovely, friendly and responsive to everyones needs. A wonderful club room far superior to others we have tried overseas."

From the amenities, restaurants and staff. Everyone is so friendly and always has a smile on their face. Nothing you ask for is too much for them. They aim to make your stay as comfortable as possible. We will definitely be back! Shout out to Vicky and all the other staff by the pool, helping us with everything we need as we spend the most time here. Edit: my husband got a little unwell and threw up. Sink got clogged. We called them and they sent someone out to fix it straight away. Then my daughter had a fever and I asked them for a thermometer so I could take her temperature. They actually bought a new one and sent it up to the room for me to check it. I’ve never stayed in a hotel that goes above and beyond for their visitors. Sofitel has won my heart for life!"
"449.","Ashwin Singh","12","2025-02-01","3","We stayed over 9 nights and throughly enjoyed all the facilities. The staff were friendly and helpful however i have to share couple of instances we did not receive 5 Star customer service at the restaurant during breakfast, lunch and dinner. While the staff were always friendly, there were couple of instances where I had to ask for plates to be removed, orders to be taken and followed up. Some of the staff spoke very basic English and requested assistance of other mature staff. Again nothing wrong with this but I don’t expect this from a 5 star hotel especially when it causes extensive delay in receiving orders."

There are hardly any trees or umbrellas, so there’s barely any shade — it’s impossible to find a comfortable spot when the sun is blazing. The water was another disappointment: full of garbage and tons of sea grass, making it unpleasant to swim. Plus, the water is extremely shallow, so you can’t even enjoy a proper swim without walking far out. Overall, it feels neglected and I wouldn’t recommend it."

"482.","Vania Olivia","1","2025-04-21","1","Mohon maaf apabila ada kritik yang kurang sesuai, saya hanya menyampaikan apa yang saya rasakan selama 3 malam (9 April - 12 April) di Sofitel Nusa Dua Bali. Saya hanya ingin membagikan cerita saya selama berada di Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua, mengingat saya sebagai tamu yang membayar 3-4juta per malam berhak untuk menceritakan apa yang saya rasakan. Saya menginap di Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua malam pertama dan ketiga saya ambil Stay Plus Keanggotaan Accor saya, beberapa bulan lalu mama saya membayar Keanggotaan Accor Plus senilai 5 juta++ mendapatkan 2 x Voucher Stay Plus jadi malam pertama dan ketiga saya hanya membayar 605 ribu dan saya membayar 3juta++ untuk malam keduanya. Saya menginap 3 malam, malam pertama dan kedua di kamar 1308 di building 1 lantai 3, saya tidak bisa tidur di kamar ini dan baru tidur jam 4 pagi sehabis subuh, mulai jam 18.30 akan banyak gangguan ketika malam tiba, suara tangisan, bau melati yang seriwingann, banyak bayangan sekelebatan yang lewat, di dalam bathub kamar mandi seperti peti yang didalamnya ada orang yang tidur, di akhirnya malam ketiga saya minta pindah dan diberikan kamar 5218 di building 5 lantai 2, dan saya baru bisa tidur dengan nyenyak. 1. Pelayanan sangat baik, malam pertama saya komplain tidak bisa tidur dan ingin membatalkan pesanan (pindah hotel), manager hotel datang mengajak ngobrol dan membawakan lampu tembak yang membuat kamar menjadi jauh lebih terang, malam ketiga saya kembali ingin pindah hotel dan membatalkan pesanan pada malam ketiga, dan kembali di handle dengan sangat baik, ditawarkan pindah kamar ke kamar 5218, pelayanan bintang 5, Terimakasih manager dan staff hotel Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua. 2. Mengingat rasa makanan nya yang kurang cocok dilidah, saya memesan makanan via GrabFood/GoFood, dan saya berharap pihak resepsionis pada lobby hotel dapat dititipkan makanan oleh driver ojek online karena jarak kamar dan lobby yang cukup jauh sehingga perlu waktu sekitar 15-30 menit berjalan kaki (karena tidak seperti di Apurva Kempinski Hotel yang menyediakan Buggy Car, atau mungkin saya saja yang tidak mendapatkan pelayanan Buggy Car tersebut) untuk mengambil pesanan GrabFood/GoFood, menurut saya sangat kasian jika driver GoFood/GrabFood harus menunggu 15-30 menit sampai pesanan diambil tamu hotel yang memesan makanan, terlepas dari lama, juga driver Grab/GoFood tidak dapat mengambil orderan dari orang lain yang mungkin masuk ketika menunggu tamu hotel mengambil pesanannya. 3. Walaupun pelayanannya bintang 5, namun responsif dari pihak customer service sangat lamaa, saya meminta seseorang datang ke kamar saya untuk membantu membawakan koper ketika checkout, 30 menit tidak kunjung datang, akhirnya saya membawa sendiri koper-koper saya tersebut dari building 5 ke Lobby yang sangat jauh itu (mengingat hak kita sebagai tamu hotel bintang 5 dengan harga 3-4 juta per malam) 4. Mama saya adalah anggota accorplus dimana diperbolehkan meminta late checkout, dan saya hanya meminta late checkout jam 1 siang (mengingat pesawat saya jam 4 sore), diperbolehkan namun diawal customer service nya menginformasikan ketentuan checkout hotel jam 11 pagi (sepemahaman saya dimana-mana ketentuan checkout hotel berbintang 5 adalah jam 12 siang). 5. Saya cukup kecewa dengan beberapa staff hotel yang tidak konsisten dalam memberikan informasi, tanggal 10 April saya menanyakan kepada salah satu staff akses menuju pantai, dan diinformasikan bahwa dapat menggunakan Buggy Car. Namun, ketika keesokan harinya saya mau melihat pantai bersama mama saya, dan saya menanyakan pada staff lain akses menuju pantai, saya diminta untuk berjalan kaki menyusuri restoran, kolam renang hotel, taman, baru sampai di pantai yang menurut saya tidak seindah pantai di Apurva Kempinski Hotel, mengingat harganya yang tidak berbeda jauh."

"486.","Hartono Yarmantho","17","2025-01-21","1","JANGAN MENGINAP disini jika ingin tidur nyenyak dan mau kamar kedap suara tanpa ada suara dari luar yang bocor. Hari pertama tgl 19 maret jam 11 malam kita hanya berbicara dengan volume nada biasa tapi tiba tiba resepsionis menelepon kamar saya 5011 dan bilang ada teguran dari kamar sebelah 5010 suara berisik. Itu luar biasa aneh karena kita ngobrol volume nada biasa saja dan dari kamar kita pun terdengar sekali suara mereka bocor batuk batuk tidak berhenti juga tanpa kedap suara. Hari kedua tgl 20 maret jam 11 malam kita juga hanya berbicara dengan nada biasa saja tapi tiba tiba bule kamar 5010 juga memencet bel kamar kita dan minta kita tidak boleh berbicara sama sekali karena dia mau istirahat. Apa maksudnya kita tidak boleh berbicara sama sekali ya????? Ini sih sudah keterlaluan sekali. Seumur hidup menginap di berbagai hotel bintang 5 di seluruh muka bumi tapi baru sekali ini ketemu kamar yang tidak ada kedap suara sama sekali di Sofitel Nusa Dua dan sungguh mengecewakan. Luar biasa Sofitel Nusa Dua buruk sekali ruangan Anda. Ditambah lagi ternyata saat check out, bell desk yang namanya Tangkas dan ada 1 lagi laki laki siapa itu malah mendiamkan keluarga saya sampai 15 menit lebih. Sopir taxi sudah datang 15 menit lebih tapi tidak ada satupun yang inisiatif bantu angkat koper saya ke taxi. Apa bell desk jijik lihat tas saya gitu ya?? Sehingga maunya saya harus angkat sendiri barang barang saya gitu ya. Sungguh luar biasa memang ini Sofitel Nusa Dua, pelayanan dari kualitas kamar sampai bell desk pun disaster bencana semua pelayanannya kualitas hotel bintang 1."
"487.","Mrs. Barus","43","2025-01-21","1","Hi Sofitel, Belum lama ini saya stay 2 malam disofitel, first impression saya sangat senang dengan para staff hotel (pak jati) yang baik dan sopan mulai dari concierge semuanya baik. Yang paling juara sih menurut saya breakfastnya ya dan pool nya serta view pantainya cm ternyata pas ke pantai pinggir pantainya agak kotor. Namun yang bikin saya kaget adalah : 1. kulkas mini yg ada di kamar itu tidak dingin sama skali kata engineer nya standard dinginnya begitu (masa htl berbintang begitu) dan akhirnya mereka bawain kulkas mini lg yg biasa aja tp berfungsi dengan baik. 2. Dikamar tidak disediakan sendal jadi saya request dr chekin tapi pas menjelang malam baru diantarkan. 3. Hari pertama saya sudah menemukan entalah bekas apa itu disarung bantal saya (cairan apalah itu) masa gak hilang. Tapi kr didlm kmr disediakan banyak bantal saya taruh bantal itu dibawah. 4. kolam anak yg kotor dan tidak dibersihkan saya sudah complaint tp gak direspon. 5. Pd hari terakhir saya mau checkout saya baru sadar ternyata 2hari ini SARUNG BANTAL TIDAK DIGANTI! apakah semua hotel termasuk di sofitel hotel bintang 5 ini seperti itu atau gimana saya tidak paham tapi menurut saya sebagai customer itu agak kurang nyaman. Bisa aja itu sarung bantal sebelumnya juga. Sangat disayangkan ya padahal yg lainnya perfect. Mungkin kedepannya bisa ada perbaikan. Thanks!"

Kata bagian reservasi oke kita notice di keep jika memungkinkan. Sy ambil 2 kmr yang 1 free nginap dari fasilitas member accor plus dan 1 lagi berbayar. Saat sy check in hari ini jam 4 pm katanya beda building untuk kamarnya. Lalu sy ty kok beda emang ga ada yg sama. Dicek ternyata ada tapi belum ready, akhirnya minta waktu 45 menit utk siapkan kamar. Saya tanya ke welcome priority accor plus yang ada di hotel terkait penggunaan voucher room upgrade responnya menurut saya tidak ramah. Saya merasa ga ramah banget pelayanannya mengecewakan bagi member accor plus. Akhirnya bayu ny deposit padahal deposit saya sdh ada sampai saya katakan apa separah itu program hotel ga lihat sy sdh ada deposit. Akhirnya disamperin duty manager yg ramah memberikan kompensasi late check out. Bagi saya itu tidak perlu karena saya butuh pelayanan yang ramah dan profesional. Saran dari saya yang harus diperhatikan bagian yang melayani customer langsung harus sadar kerja di hotel bintang 5 hrs bisa bekerja profesional dan ramah jangan sp spti standar buruk seperti pelayanan hotel bintang 1 yang saya rasakan."

Tapi waktu sampai hotel jam 5 sore untuk check in, masih belum bisa masuk kamar. Lalu ada salah satu staff hotel membantu kami mencarikan kamar dan menawarkan untuk minum welcome drink, itupun juga tdk ada tmpt duduk. Setelah dapat kamar, 1 dari 3 kamar yg kami book AC nya rusak & harus menunggu 1jam lg untuk ganti kamar lain. Kamar juga kotor, bahkan ada sampah kulit kacang. Waktu breakfast juga tdk ada protokol kesehatan yg ketat untuk hotel sekelas sofitel. Tempat breakfast sgt penuh, bahkan sulit cari meja untuk duduk."

Pada saat check out, saya meminta invoice, tapi katanya tidak bisa diberikan, krn payment dilakukan oleh Agoda. Saya minta ke agoda, ternyata juga tidak bisa, karena payment dilakukan di property. Menyebabkan saya harus telpon bolak balik, dilempar sana sini, agoda blg dibayar di property, saya tlp property lagi bilang payment oleh agoda, sampai udah hampir 3 minggu. Akhirnya agoda email, bahwa invoice akan dikirimkan oleh property, karena dibayarkan di property. Saya email tidak dibalas sampai saya resend email tersebut berkali2, dijawab akan dikirim di email terpisah. Padahal saya minta invoice utk bisa segera dikirimkan hari itu. Dan ternyata sampai H+1 invoice tidak dikirim juga. Saya bingung, org2 di hotel tersebut gak baca email, atau tidak menganggap customer Secara serius. Yang akhirnya, saya menderita kerugian tidak hanya waktu dan tenaga, tapi juga materi. Thanks Sofitel! Dari customer yang sangat kecewa !! Yang sampai saat ini, invoice yang saya minta belum dikirim."

"550.","PY W","25","2025-11-21","1","Saat ini kami menginap di Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua dan sejujurnya, ini adalah salah satu pengalaman hotel paling mengecewakan yang pernah kami alami, terutama dari properti yang mengklaim bintang 5. Kami memesan dua kamar sebagai bagian dari keanggotaan loyalitas kami, mengharapkan kenyamanan dan layanan berkualitas. Namun, sejak check-in, pengalaman kami sungguh mengejutkan. Saat kami memasuki kamar, laci kamar mandi benar-benar kosong, bahkan fasilitas dasar seperti kantong teh pun tidak ada. Kami harus menelepon hanya untuk memintanya. Kemudian keadaan menjadi lebih buruk. Saat mandi, saya menemukan noda darah di kamar mandi dan di dekat wastafel. Saya mencoba mengabaikannya dan membersihkannya sendiri, tetapi kemudian, ketika saya pergi tidur, saya menemukan lebih banyak noda darah di seprai. Benar-benar tidak dapat diterima. Untuk hotel bintang 5, tingkat kebersihan seperti ini sangat menjijikkan. Kami segera menghubungi layanan tamu, yang mengatakan manajer akan menghubungi kami kembali dalam 5 menit, tetapi tidak ada yang melakukannya. Setelah saya menelepon lagi, mereka hanya mengatakan akan ada yang datang untuk mengganti seprai. Ketika manajer akhirnya tiba, ia menyilangkan tangan dan berbicara kepada saya dengan nada meremehkan, seolah-olah sayalah masalahnya. Sikap seperti itu tidak profesional dan sama sekali tidak sopan. Kami membayar untuk 4 malam di 2 kamar, dan inilah yang kami dapatkan: noda darah, layanan yang buruk, dan manajer yang tampaknya tidak peduli. Tempat ini tidak pantas mendapatkan peringkat bintang 5. Stafnya jelas membutuhkan pelatihan yang memadai dalam hal kebersihan, layanan pelanggan, dan keramahan dasar. Kami menulis ulasan ini saat masih menginap di sini karena begitulah kesal dan marahnya kami. Sungguh mengecewakan dari merek yang dulu kami percayai."
"551.","Hannes Louwrens","2","2026-01-07","1","Sangat Mengecewakan – Tidak Sebanding dengan Harga atau Hype-nya Sejak hari pertama, hotel ini benar-benar mimpi buruk, dan tidak pernah membaik. Pemesanan akomodasi dan aktivitas sudah menjadi bencana. Tautan pembayaran terus-menerus tidak berfungsi, komunikasi buruk, dan bahkan setelah beberapa kali mencoba, pemesanan Malam Tahun Baru kami masih salah. Itu saja seharusnya sudah menjadi tanda peringatan. Kami memesan suite dan kamar twin dan secara khusus meminta check-in lebih awal, yang menurut mereka tidak akan menjadi masalah. Kami tiba pukul 1 siang dan disuruh menunggu hingga pukul 3 sore. Check-in lebih awal ternyata tidak sesuai harapan. Selain itu, dengan akses Club Millésime, check-out terlambat seharusnya termasuk, namun kami diberitahu untuk keluar sebelum pukul 12 siang. Mengapa saya membayar ekstra untuk fasilitas yang tidak dapat saya gunakan? Ada juga kurangnya pemahaman bahasa Inggris yang serius, sehingga hampir tidak mungkin untuk menyelesaikan masalah. Setiap keluhan dijawab dengan respons yang sama dan tidak berguna: Kami akan menyelidikinya. Tidak ada yang pernah diperbaiki. Saat menginap di suite, Anda mengharapkan fasilitas yang lebih baik daripada rumah sendiri. Namun, kenyataannya jauh dari itu. Kasurnya sangat tidak nyaman, pancuran airnya hampir tidak bertekanan, dan secara keseluruhan kamar terasa mengecewakan dan murahan untuk harga yang dikenakan. Sejujurnya, setelah masalah yang muncul sejak awal, kami seharusnya tidak memesan hotel ini dan seharusnya memperpanjang masa inap kami di Westin saja. Area kolam renang juga mengecewakan. Anda hampir tidak pernah bisa mendapatkan tempat duduk, meskipun ada spanduk di mana-mana yang menyatakan bahwa Anda tidak dapat memesan kursi atau gazebo lebih dari 30 menit atau barang-barang Anda akan dipindahkan. Jelas, aturan tersebut tidak berlaku untuk siapa pun di sini. Area check-in khusus Club Millésime yang disebut-sebut itu tidak berguna. Kami tidak diberi informasi yang memadai tentang cara kerja semuanya — di mana restoran berada, di mana harus makan, atau apa saja yang termasuk dalam fasilitas tersebut. Saat mencoba menagihkan barang ke kamar kami, kami diberitahu bahwa tidak ada penangguhan kartu, yang tidak pernah dijelaskan sebelumnya. Sebagai tamu Club Millésime, hal ini seharusnya dikomunikasikan dengan jelas sejak awal. Di Westin, ini tidak pernah menjadi masalah. Hotel ini sangat mahal dan terasa seperti hanya ada untuk menipu wisatawan. Lebih buruk lagi, kolam renangnya memiliki ubin yang pecah, yang melukai jari kaki anak-anak kami. Kami terpaksa keluar dan membeli sepatu renang khusus agar mereka dapat menggunakan kolam renang dengan aman. Benar-benar tidak dapat diterima. Kekecewaan terbesar adalah Malam Tahun Baru. Karena ketidakmampuan total hotel dan pemesanan yang salah, kami membatalkan rencana yang benar-benar kami nantikan. Alih-alih perayaan yang layak, kami membeli makanan dan minuman sendiri dan duduk di balkon kami. Tidak ada pertunjukan kembang api, orang-orang meninggalkan tempat acara lebih awal, tidak ada yang mengesankan — namun mereka mengenakan biaya $300 per orang, dan kami bahkan diberitahu bahwa kami harus membayar lagi untuk ibu saya karena kesalahan pemesanan mereka. Ini setelah saya secara fisik pergi ke hotel saat masih menginap di Westin untuk memastikan semuanya beres. Kami melakukan perjalanan ke negara lain khusus untuk merayakan Malam Tahun Baru, dan itu benar-benar hancur. Saya bisa saja pulang dan mengadakan perayaan Tahun Baru yang lebih baik sendiri. Terus terang saja: toilet mewah di kamar mandi kami berfungsi lebih baik daripada tim reservasi. Satu-satunya pengalaman positif di hotel ini adalah para pelayan, yang ramah dan membantu. Sayangnya, mereka adalah satu-satunya yang tampaknya peduli. Saya tidak akan pernah merekomendasikan hotel ini kepada siapa pun dan tentu saja tidak akan pernah kembali."
"552.","Julius Scharner","22","2025-10-21","1","Nilai uang yang mengecewakan di Sofitel Nusa Dua Setelah tur Bali yang fantastis, saya dan istri ingin bersantai di Sofitel Nusa Dua, tetapi secara keseluruhan pengalaman menginap kami mengecewakan. Hotelnya terlihat kuno. Kamarnya bersih, tetapi tidak modern maupun mewah. Akses ke pantai, yang kami nanti-nantikan, hampir tidak bisa digunakan: airnya keruh dan keruh, karang yang tajam, dan arus yang kuat membuat berenang tidak nyaman. Selain itu, kapal kargo terus-menerus lewat. Berenang sama sekali tidak cocok untuk anak-anak, dan pantainya tampak terbengkalai dan jarang dikunjungi orang. Harganya juga kurang tepat: makanan dan minuman terkadang dua kali lipat harga hotel bintang 5 lainnya di Bali, dengan kualitas yang pas-pasan. Karena itu, kami makan di luar hampir setiap malam. Kekurangan: Restoran La Cucina Meskipun kami sudah berada di hotel selama lima hari dan restorannya setengah kosong setiap malam, kami ditolak masuk tanpa reservasi. Suatu malam pukul 20.00, maksimal 10 dari perkiraan 80 kursi terisi! Namun, resepsionis memberi tahu kami bahwa restoran sudah penuh. Kami tidak akan bisa mendapatkan dua kursi lagi selama satu jam lagi. Ini tidak masuk akal, tidak profesional, dan sangat merusak kesan keseluruhan kami. Apa yang bisa berubah di restoran kosong dalam satu jam? Kami bahkan pergi untuk memeriksa, tetapi masih kosong, dan kami kembali ke kota untuk makan malam. Staf di seluruh hotel ramah dan membantu, tetapi itu tidak menutupi kekurangan mendasarnya. Kesimpulan: Tidak direkomendasikan bagi mereka yang mencari relaksasi, keluarga dengan anak-anak, atau wisatawan pantai. Nilai uangnya sungguh tidak sepadan di sini."
"553.","Viju George","11","2026-01-07","1","Pengalaman saya di Sofitel Nusa Dua mengecewakan sejak saat check-in. Perhatian yang diberikan oleh tim resepsionis sangat minim, komunikasi tidak jelas, dan komitmen yang dibuat mengenai waktu tidak ditepati. Bahkan setelah waktu yang dijanjikan terlampaui, tidak ada pembaruan proaktif, tidak ada permintaan maaf, dan tidak ada rasa urgensi. Yang paling mengecewakan adalah kurangnya pemulihan layanan. Alih-alih pengakuan atau tindak lanjut yang tulus, yang ditawarkan hanyalah voucher koktail, yang terasa lebih seperti isyarat simbolis daripada upaya tulus untuk mengatasi masalah tersebut. Tidak ada tindak lanjut dan tidak ada pertanggungjawaban atas komitmen yang dibuat. Untuk merek yang memposisikan diri sebagai pemimpin perhotelan mewah, pengalaman ini menunjukkan bahwa Sofitel Nusa Dua telah kehilangan sentuhan dengan apa arti layanan sejati — perhatian, komunikasi, dan tanggung jawab ketika terjadi kesalahan. Sayangnya, pengalaman menginap ini tidak memenuhi harapan yang terkait dengan nama Sofitel."
"554.","Umm M","14","2025-12-24","1","Liburan keluarga kami benar-benar hancur karena masalah keamanan serius di kamar kami. Saya mengalami patah jari kaki setelah terbentur kaki sofa yang menonjol, mengakibatkan memar dan bengkak parah. Saya menghabiskan sisa waktu menginap di kamar dan di kursi roda, tidak dapat berpartisipasi dalam aktivitas apa pun bersama keluarga saya! Bagian yang paling mengecewakan adalah tanggapan hotel. Manajer, Amy, telah diberitahu dan diperlihatkan kaki saya yang jelas-jelas cedera dengan pembengkakan dan memar parah, namun dia terus mengatakan saya harus pergi ke rumah sakit dan melakukan rontgen untuk membuktikannya. Terlepas dari itu, hotel gagal bertanggung jawab atau menunjukkan itikad baik. Pengembalian uang atau menginap gratis di masa mendatang seharusnya dapat ditawarkan mengingat keadaan tersebut, karena anak-anak saya tidak dapat menikmati masa menginap mereka di hotel, tetapi tidak ada yang dilakukan terkait hal itu. Kami mendapat makan malam gratis di hari terakhir dan mobil ke bandara, tetapi itu seperti tamparan di wajah kami begitu saja. Kami bepergian dengan teman-teman, dan total tujuh anak terpengaruh karena rencana kami sangat terbatas karena cedera saya. Anak bungsu saya berusia 2 tahun dan saya harus beristirahat di tempat tidur dan merawatnya. Untuk hotel yang mempromosikan dirinya sebagai hotel mewah dan ramah keluarga, kurangnya akuntabilitas, empati, dan perhatian terhadap keselamatan tamu sangat mengecewakan. Saya akan mendesak calon tamu untuk berhati-hati saat memesan di sini! Saya tidak tahu berapa banyak orang yang telah terbentur jari kakinya karena desain yang cacat ini! Menambahkan foto terbaru cedera saya!! Yang mana Amy, sang manajer, mengatakan dia tidak dapat bertanggung jawab atau memberikan kompensasi."

Petugas wanita mempersilakan kami duduk pukul 13.50 untuk mengisi formulir dan memproses check-in, tetapi masih belum ada kamar yang tersedia. Petugas wanita itu memberi tahu bahwa akan ada pesan WA ketika kamar sudah siap. Kami meminta untuk menggunakan pusat kebugaran atau fasilitas lainnya, tetapi ditolak. Tidak ada kunci kamar, dan tidak bisa masuk pusat kebugaran. Kami duduk dan membuang-buang waktu sampai pukul 16.07, kami mendapat informasi WA bahwa kamar kami sudah siap. Ketika kami memasuki kamar, ternyata sudah untuk tamu lain.... Bagaimana bisa Sofitel, hotel premium, salah mengelola saat check-in? Benar-benar berantakan dan kami membuang-buang waktu selama 3 jam tanpa melakukan apa pun di lobi. Saya mendengar petugas di meja check-in berkata melalui telepon: mengapa tidak mengantre kamar dari pukul 13.50? Dia harus minta maaf beberapa kali, tapi kita sudah lelah"

"559.","Raman Arora","2","2025-07-21","1","Menginap di Sofitel Bali untuk Ulang Tahun yang Mengecewakan – Tak Sesuai Harapan Saya dari Properti Mewah Saya menginap di Sofitel Bali selama tiga malam untuk merayakan ulang tahun yang bersejarah — sebuah momen yang ingin saya rayakan dengan pengalaman yang tak terlupakan. Sayangnya, beberapa kesalahan fatal membuat pengalaman menginap ini sama sekali tidak menyenangkan. 1. Keterlambatan Check-in: Meskipun waktu check-in telah dikonfirmasi, kami harus menunggu hampir dua jam sebelum mendapatkan kamar. Setelah perjalanan yang panjang, hal ini sungguh membuat frustrasi. 2. Insiden Sepeda Berbahaya: Saat bersepeda dengan salah satu sepeda hotel, engkolnya tiba-tiba putus di tengah perjalanan, menyebabkan saya terpeleset dan hampir cedera. Saya beruntung tidak mengalami patah kaki. Ketika saya kembali ke hotel dengan engkol yang patah dan meminta transportasi untuk kedua teman saya yang masih bersepeda, staf menolak membantu — sebuah respons yang mengejutkan atas potensi masalah keselamatan yang serius. 3. Penagihan Kartu Kredit Tidak Sah: Setelah melunasi tagihan di kasir, saya kemudian menerima tagihan manual di kartu kredit saya tanpa komunikasi atau persetujuan apa pun. Meskipun jumlahnya mungkin benar, menagih tamu setelah kasir tanpa memberi tahu mereka adalah tindakan yang sangat tidak profesional dan sejujurnya, hampir seperti penipuan. Ketika saya menyampaikan kekhawatiran ini, manajer yang bertugas menawarkan beberapa poin loyalitas sebagai kompensasi — tetapi itu terasa seperti renungan, alih-alih upaya tulus untuk memperbaiki keadaan. Untuk sebuah merek yang menjanjikan kemewahan dan layanan prima, pengalaman menginap ini sangat mengecewakan. Saya harap manajemen menanggapi masalah ini dengan serius — tidak seharusnya tamu harus berurusan dengan bahaya keselamatan, layanan yang buruk, atau tagihan yang mengejutkan, terutama saat merayakan acara yang hanya terjadi sekali dalam satu dekade."
"560.","Claire Y","22","2025-10-21","1","Setelah kejadian darurat pribadi, saya menerima layanan yang sangat buruk dari tim reservasi hotel ini. Antara lain, (1) mereka membatalkan reservasi saya secara sepihak tanpa konfirmasi tegas dari saya; (2) meskipun satu malam menggunakan tarif fleksibel yang *SUKARELA* saya bayar di muka dan kalau tidak, saya bahkan tidak akan menagih biaya pembatalan, mereka mengatakan bahwa uang muka untuk malam itu (bersama dengan semua malam lainnya) akan tetap saya simpan (meskipun saya sudah menawarkan untuk membayar di muka); dan mereka tidak menunjukkan niat baik apa pun sampai saya melapor ke tim Accor Plus (kesetiaan tidak berarti apa-apa bagi Sofitel Bali), dan bahkan setelah itu, mereka tidak membalas berbagai email saya sampai Accor Plus menagih mereka. Mereka kemudian mengatakan bahwa niat baik mereka akan berupa tarif khusus di masa mendatang. Ini tidak berarti apa-apa mengingat saya berniat untuk tidak pernah menginap di Sofitel Bali setelah pengalaman ini, dan sangat berbeda dengan dua hotel lain yang sebanding yang (a) menawarkan pembatalan tanpa penalti dan (b) menunda masa inap saya ke masa mendatang di mana saya membayar selisih harga. Ada hotel bintang 5 dan ada hotel bintang 5, dan di Bali, ada banyak pilihan. Jangan memesan di Sofitel Bali jika Anda mengharapkan tim reservasi yang empatik atau fleksibel. Edit: untuk memperjelas, tidak ada yang menghubungi saya untuk menawarkan bantuan. Saya menawarkan untuk membayar lebih untuk masa inap di masa mendatang. Saya menawarkan untuk membayar biaya administrasi. Apa pun agar tidak kehilangan uang yang sudah dibayarkan. Kalian tidak peduli dan hanya menyimpan uangnya."

Saya mengerti bahwa menutup kolam renang tidak terpikirkan oleh mereka, tetapi bukankah kesehatan kami lebih penting? Yang terburuk adalah tidak ada seorang pun yang kembali kepada kami."

Airnya sangat kotor sehingga saya tidak bisa melihat satu meter pun di depan saya di bawah air. Awalnya saya bersyukur atas peningkatan kamar akses penuh, tetapi di sana sangat lembap dan berbau seperti ruang bawah tanah yang berjamur sehingga saya tidak ingin kembali lagi. Jika Anda sensitif terhadap wewangian, sebaiknya bawa perlengkapan mandi L'Occitane Anda sendiri. Aromanya sangat tidak sedap sehingga saya sakit kepala. Saya bertanya kepada staf lounge apakah mereka punya wewangian lain dan mereka menyuruh saya membelinya sendiri. Memang benar Anda harus membelinya jika tidak cocok untuk Anda, tetapi mendengar tanggapan seperti itu dari staf lounge hotel sangat tidak menyenangkan. Saya memesan Cucina dengan ekspektasi tinggi, tetapi cuacanya panas, butuh waktu lama untuk mendapatkan makanan, dan pastanya terlalu matang."
"564.","Jay Hothi","10","2025-06-21","1","Sangat kecewa dengan pengalaman saya di hotel ini, yang tidak seperti apa pun yang pernah saya alami di hotel 'kelas atas' sebelumnya. Kami diantar oleh Ricky, yang layanan dan sikapnya luar biasa. Dia baik, ramah, dan membantu. Sayangnya, itulah yang menjadi puncak dari dua malam menginap kami. Kami meminta sabun cuci piring untuk membersihkan botol susu bayi kami - awalnya ditolak karena mereka tidak punya; ketika diberitahu bahwa mereka harus menyediakan sabun cuci piring untuk mencuci piring di dapur, penjelasannya berubah dari kami tidak menyediakan ini, menjadi tidak aman untuk bayi, menjadi menyediakan ini melanggar prosedur operasi standar kami. Resepsionis bahkan menyarankan (pukul 10 malam) oh, sebaiknya Anda keluar dan membelinya - layanan yang memang layak dibayar ribuan dolar (!). Ketegangan terakhir terjadi setelah permintaan itu diajukan, dan kami diberi tahu bahwa kami akan menerima kabar terbaru. Seseorang mengetuk pintu saya tiga kali pukul 22.00 meskipun kami sudah jelas-jelas memberi tahu resepsionis untuk tidak melakukannya. Bayi itu sedang tidur, dan karena mereka, kami tidak bisa memberinya susu jika ia terbangun. Ia memang terbangun karena ketukan itu dan tidak akan tenang tanpa susunya karena kami hanya punya botol-botol kotor. Kami telah menginap di sejumlah hotel di seluruh dunia dan tidak pernah mengalami hal seperti ini - alasan-alasannya, kurangnya bantuan, dan secara keseluruhan, sikap keras kepala dan ketidakmauannya. Sesuatu yang sangat mendasar yang sebenarnya bisa membantu kami, dan tidak ada alasan nyata untuk tidak mau melakukannya. Tidak akan kembali lagi."

Kami kembali setelah 3 jam dan masih harus menunggu 25 menit lagi hanya untuk mendapatkan kunci. Hotel ini entah kekurangan staf atau manajemennya buruk. Hanya dua orang yang menangani proses check-in, sementara tiga orang lainnya berdiri membukakan pintu dan menyajikan minuman, dan itu pun sangat lambat~!!! Butuh 10 menit untuk mendapatkan minuman selamat datang kami — tidak bisa diterima. Sarapannya juga mengecewakan — terlalu ramai dan kualitasnya buruk.

Karena tidak dapat melakukan pemesanan, saya mencoba menghubungi hotel untuk menanyakan apakah kami dapat memindahkan pemesanan kami, dengan senang hati membayar lebih untuk menutupi perubahan tarif, tetapi kami mendapat pesan yang mengecewakan bahwa meskipun mereka menyesal, mereka tidak akan mengizinkan kami untuk mengubah tanggal pemesanan kami. Meskipun saya menyadari bahwa kami memesan dengan kebijakan tanpa pembatalan, saya tidak meminta untuk membatalkan pemesanan atau meminta pengembalian dana atau kompensasi dalam bentuk apa pun. Saya hanya ingin memindahkan pemesanan kami ke akhir tahun agar kami akhirnya dapat beristirahat setelah masa yang sangat sulit bagi kami. Mendapatkan tanggapan seperti kami sepenuhnya memahami betapa mengecewakan dan menegangkannya hal ini hingga kami memberi tahu Anda bahwa syarat dan ketentuan yang terkait dengan pemesanan Anda tetap berlaku - bahkan setelah mengirimkan dokumentasi tentang perawatan di rumah sakit dan informasi operasi yang menyoroti tingkat cedera parah tunangan saya; sungguh memilukan. Kami pernah menginap di banyak cabang Sofitel lainnya sebelumnya dan selalu sangat puas dengan pelayanannya; salah satu alasan utama kami memesan kamar di sini saat mengunjungi Bali.

"568.","M","4","2025-03-21","1","Kami menginap di hotel populer ini, memercayai foto-foto indah dan janji-janji di situs web. Namun kenyataannya, bisa dibilang, berbeda. Mari kita mulai dengan kamarnya: furniturnya tua dan kotor, seolah-olah dibeli saat obral. AC-nya tampaknya setua hotelnya – baunya busuk. Seprai dan gordennya sangat mengganggu: noda membandel, goresan, dan bau yang tampaknya lebih mudah dibuang daripada dicuci. Ketel di kamar sudah tua dan kotor sampai tidak bisa diminum, begitu pula mesin kopinya. Kualitas airnya sungguh tak terbantahkan: di Indonesia, kualitas airnya sudah dipertanyakan, dan di sini, tampaknya mereka sama sekali tidak memikirkan bahan yang mereka gunakan untuk menyiapkan makanan, bahkan di restoran kelas atas sekalipun. Situs web tersebut mengklaim hotelnya tenang dan kamar-kamarnya tenang. Kenyataannya, sistem kedap suaranya fantastis. Karena iklim yang lembap, kamar-kamarnya selalu lembap dan mustahil untuk berventilasi. Ada bau apek yang terus tercium, yang entah kenapa, coba ditutupi oleh pihak manajemen, sehingga memperburuk keadaan. Bahkan pindah ke kamar hotel yang lebih nyaman dengan kolam renang pribadi pun tidak membantu. Rasanya campur aduk. Lantai dasar bahkan lebih lembap, dan semua orang di kamar atas bisa melihat Anda berenang dan berjemur di sudut kecil Anda. Privasi dan keterpencilan jelas bukan keunggulan hotel ini. Soal staf, mereka juga sangat mengecewakan. Mereka tidak peduli dengan alergi atau kebutuhan khusus Anda. Mereka hanya melakukan apa yang mereka anggap terbaik, tidak lebih. Staf pria bisa duduk di toilet wanita dan mengobrol di telepon selama berjam-jam, sama sekali tidak menghiraukan kehadiran Anda. Yang paling menyedihkan adalah toilet di bandara pun lebih bersih dan lebih nyaman daripada yang ada di hotel ini. Hotel ini mengingatkan pada bangunan-bangunan tua Soviet. Hotel ini tidak sepadan dengan harganya, atau lebih tepatnya, harga yang Anda bayarkan. Saya tidak akan merekomendasikan menginap di sini kepada siapa pun yang menghargai sedikit saja kenyamanan dan harga diri."

Hotel itu sendiri sebenarnya cukup bagus, dan lokasinya menjanjikan, tetapi insiden tersebut menodai seluruh masa menginap saya. Cara penanganan situasi tersebut sangat mengecewakan – saya mengharapkan dukungan yang jauh lebih besar dan rasa tanggung jawab yang lebih tinggi dari staf hotel. Saya sangat berharap hotel mempertimbangkan kembali dan meningkatkan standar keamanannya. Bagi saya pribadi, sayangnya ini bukanlah tempat yang akan saya kenang dengan baik."
"570.","Justine Weekes","3","2025-05-21","1","Dua dari empat kamar yang kami tempati benar-benar berbau jamur dari AC. Bukan hanya sedikit, tapi sangat kuat dan sulit tidur setiap malam. Solusi Sofitel adalah mencoba menutupi bau tersebut dengan semprotan kamar mandi beraroma sangat kuat dan memasang dehumidifier di kamar, lalu mendaftarkan Anda ke program afiliasi mereka untuk mendapatkan kredit $20 sebagai kompensasi sehingga Anda dipersilakan untuk berbelanja lebih banyak di sana. Manajemennya sangat buruk dan sangat mengecewakan untuk menginap mahal di resor yang seharusnya bintang 5. Mereka menegur kami karena tampaknya tidak cukup banyak mengeluh. Manajer mengatakan itu hanya masalah karena cuaca lembap di Bali, tetapi tidak ada tempat lain yang kami tinggali atau kunjungi yang mengalami masalah ini. Bersihkan AC Anda di Sofitel Nusa Dua!"

Sayangnya, pengalaman kami sangat mengecewakan sejak awal. Penanganan Keluhan Kebisingan yang Buruk Pada malam kedua, kami berkumpul di salah satu dari empat kamar kami untuk bermain permainan papan dan bertukar kabar. Pukul 12.15 dini hari, kami menerima telepon yang mengatakan bahwa kami terlalu berisik dan perlu mengurangi volume—jadi kami melakukannya. Lima menit kemudian, seorang karyawan hotel dan seorang petugas keamanan datang untuk mengingatkan kami lagi dan kemudian menempatkan petugas keamanan di luar kamar kami. Hal ini membuat kami sangat tidak nyaman, jadi kami pindah ke lobi seperti yang disarankan—hanya untuk mendapati bahwa lobinya panas dan tidak ada AC. Kami membayar lebih untuk kamar kami, tetapi kami dibiarkan duduk dengan tidak nyaman di lobi. Pada malam ketiga, kami ekstra hati-hati dan berkumpul di ruang tengah agar tidak mengganggu siapa pun. Meskipun demikian, kami menerima telepon lagi sekitar pukul 12.30 dini hari yang mengatakan bahwa kami berisik. Ketika kami bertanya dari pihak mana keluhan itu berasal, staf tersebut panik dan mengatakan bahwa manajer jaga akan menelepon kami. Manajer jaga kemudian mengklaim bahwa keluhan itu berasal dari lantai bawah dan bahwa kami sedang memindahkan furnitur—padahal kami sama sekali tidak melakukannya. Karena frustrasi, kami menawarkan untuk pindah ke area di mana kami tidak akan mengganggu siapa pun atau bahkan check out lebih awal jika mereka mengembalikan uang kami, tetapi kekhawatiran kami diabaikan. Keesokan harinya, mereka mengirimkan sekeranjang buah sebagai permintaan maaf, yang tidak menyelesaikan masalah yang berulang. Perilaku Invasif dan Kasar dari Staf Pada malam terakhir kami, kami membawa durian dari pasar lokal, bersemangat untuk mencobanya. Begitu kami memasuki hotel, staf mengkonfrontasi kami tentang baunya dan menggeledah tas kami tanpa izin—sesuatu yang sama sekali tidak dapat diterima di hotel yang katanya bintang 5. Tidak ada tanda yang menyatakan durian dilarang, namun alih-alih menawarkan solusi yang masuk akal, karyawan tersebut bersikap tegas dan kasar, menolak untuk membiarkan kami masuk ke hotel dengan durian. Bahkan ketika kami menawarkan untuk memakannya di pantai, mereka bersikeras agar kami berjalan-jalan di sekitar hotel dan dikawal oleh petugas keamanan. Perlakuan seperti ini sama sekali tidak perlu dan memalukan. Kesimpulan Umum Untuk sebuah resor mewah, kami mengharapkan layanan, profesionalisme, dan akomodasi yang jauh lebih baik. Namun, kami justru mengalami ketidaknyamanan, komunikasi yang buruk, dan perilaku mengganggu dari beberapa staf. Acara reuni kami terus-menerus terganggu, dan kami pulang dengan perasaan frustrasi dan tidak diterima. Kami tidak akan pernah kembali ke hotel ini dan tidak merekomendasikannya kepada siapa pun yang mencari pengalaman menginap yang santai dan berkualitas tinggi di Bali."

Makanan dan minuman juga sangat lambat, dan lalat beterbangan di sekitar, tetapi tidak ada tanggapan yang tepat. Staf mengabaikan saya bahkan ketika saya mengangkat tangan. Ketika saya pergi sarapan, beberapa anggota staf bahkan melewati saya, meskipun saya sedang menunggu untuk dilayani. Restoran bahkan tidak memiliki peralatan makan anak-anak. Meskipun makanannya enak, pelayanannya sangat lambat. Saya lapar sambil menunggu pesanan saya. Ketika saya check-in, mereka tidak memberi saya tanda terima, dan saya awalnya ditagih secara tidak benar. Pelayan tampaknya meminta tip, dan staf secara keseluruhan tampaknya membutuhkan lebih banyak pelatihan. Hanya di Toya, minuman disajikan dengan benar, dan makanan keluar dengan cukup cepat. Mereka bahkan menyediakan gelas plastik untuk anak-anak. Saya pribadi menyukai Sofitel di negara lain, jadi saya memiliki ekspektasi tinggi, tetapi Sofitel Bali adalah yang terburuk.

Saya dan pasangan saya menginap untuk menghabiskan satu malam gratis di resor ini, membayar tambahan $200 untuk mendapatkan kolam renang pribadi di halaman belakang. Kamarnya berbau seperti resor tua (berbau seperti jamur dan kamarnya sangat lembab), detailnya tidak diperhatikan (banyak jamur di kamar mandi, di sudut) dan kepala pancuran rusak... rasanya seperti menginap di vila kolam renang Airbnb di Seminyak (saya rasa Airbnb akan memiliki kondisi yang jauh lebih baik dengan detailnya). Namun, lokasi dan stafnya benar-benar ramah dan profesional dalam memberikan layanan. Saya dengan bangga mengatakan bahwa saya akan selalu memilih Sofitel jika ada pilihan tempat saya bisa menginap di mana pun saya bepergian, tetapi Sofitel di Nusa Dua ini mengecewakan saya dalam perjalanan saya dan saya mungkin tidak ingin kembali."

"579.","Ibrahim Al-Sarayrah","11","2025-01-21","1","Kepada yang terhormat: Semoga ulasan saya sampai kepada Anda sebelum Anda memesan kamar di Sofitel Nusa Dua; Mohon izinkan saya meluangkan waktu berharga Anda sejenak untuk meringankan penderitaan yang kami alami di hotel yang katanya bintang 5 ini selama LIMA HARI yang menyebalkan!!!!! Tidak ada komunikasi yang jelas dengan staf, kamar tidak terisolasi sama sekali dari lingkungan luar, pengalaman bersantap sangat buruk, tidak ada sarapan di kamar meskipun kami mendapatkan kamar mewah! Restorannya tidak bagus, layanan kamar sangat lama, baterai brankas tiba-tiba mati dan Anda harus menunggu 45 menit untuk mendapatkan seseorang yang akan memperbaiki baterainya! Kami meminta es dan mereka membutuhkan waktu lebih dari setengah jam untuk mendapatkannya, harganya sangat mahal, terutama jika Anda memesan sarapan di kamar, mereka lambat dan tidak membantu! Saya menyarankan siapa pun yang berencana mengunjungi Bali yang indah untuk tidak menginap di sini, karena sepertinya tidak ada yang peduli bahwa mereka tidak mampu memberikan layanan pelanggan dengan baik! Dan untuk referensi di masa mendatang; Mohon jangan mengambil rekomendasi dari hotel atau restoran mana pun di area ini, mereka tidak tahu bagaimana seharusnya rasa MAKANAN ITALIA, bukan hanya Italia saja, makanannya tidak enak! Namun, bagian terbaik dari masa inap kami adalah tupai-tupai yang selalu kami ajak sarapan setiap pagi! Hormat saya; Pelanggan yang tidak akan pernah kembali."
"580.","charlioko","4","2025-02-21","1","JANGAN REKOMENDASIKAN RESOR INI. Kami memesan paket upgrade 8 hari melalui Luxury Escapes (Australia). Seminggu sebelum kedatangan kami, ayah saya dilarikan ke unit perawatan intensif di Inggris dan saya harus kembali ke sana—sejak itu beliau didiagnosis menderita penyakit terminal. Kami segera memberi tahu pihak resor melalui Luxury Escapes dan secara langsung. Luxury Escapes menyarankan bahwa mereka akan meminta perubahan tanggal, dan menemukan tanggal di mana paket yang sama persis dengan harga yang sama tersedia 6 minggu kemudian—penyetujuannya sepenuhnya berada di tangan pihak resor. Setelah 3 email bolak-balik, termasuk saya yang memberikan bukti dari rumah sakit, penerbangan kembali saya ke Inggris, dan tangkapan layar pesan antara keluarga saya—dan saya menawarkan untuk membayar biaya perubahan tanggal sebesar $500 agar tidak perlu mengurus klaim asuransi selama ayah saya dalam kondisi kritis, pihak hotel menolak untuk mengubah tanggal meskipun paket tersebut tersedia. Yang lebih menyakitkan lagi, mereka mengirimkan ucapan belasungkawa kosong melalui Luxury Escapes, dan meskipun sudah diberitahu bahwa kami tidak akan bisa bepergian, saya dihubungi oleh pengemudi transfer yang menyatakan bahwa dia sedang menunggu kami di bandara. Saat itu ayah saya sedang sakit parah di ruang perawatan intensif. Pelayanan pelanggan yang serakah dan menjijikkan. Saya punya banyak teman yang mempertimbangkan untuk memesan resor ini setelah kami menceritakan pengalaman kami—Anda telah kehilangan banyak pelanggan."

Sayangnya, kami tidak menerima sarapan dan hadiah romantis di kamar seperti yang dijanjikan. Saya sangat kecewa karena ini adalah ulang tahun pernikahan kami yang ke-20 dan kami telah merencanakan hari istimewa ini di bulan Juli. Selain itu, fasilitas kamar tidak memadai. Knob shower kamar mandi terlepas dan kami harus meminta perbaikan, tirai tidak bisa dibuka yang tidak dapat diperbaiki oleh teknisi Anda, dan gantungan shower juga terlepas. Saya telah menjadi anggota Accor Plus selama 11 tahun terakhir dan telah mengunjungi Sofitel di berbagai belahan Asia, tetapi tidak pernah kecewa."
"583.","abdul shah","12","2025-01-21","1","Saya baru-baru ini menginap di resor bintang 5 ini, tetapi sayangnya, saya merasa agak kecewa. Proses check-in cukup lambat, yang awalnya terasa kurang nyaman. Meskipun kamar-kamarnya ditata dengan baik, kondisinya sudah menunjukkan usianya. Pintu kamar mandi di kamar kami hampir tidak bisa digerakkan dan berisik. Kami menginap di dua kamar: satu kamar ber-AC-nya dingin sekali, sementara yang lain hampir tidak dingin. Selain itu, salah satu saluran airnya lambat atau tersumbat saat kami tiba. Kami melaporkan kedua masalah tersebut, saluran airnya sudah diperbaiki, dan AC-nya masih bisa ditoleransi. Secara keseluruhan, properti ini memang menunjukkan tanda-tanda penuaan, meskipun masih layak. Kekecewaan terbesar kami adalah pengalaman bersantap di restoran Kweezeen. Kami membuat reservasi makan malam untuk menonton pertunjukan Barong, yang spektakuler, tetapi makanannya biasa saja. Menunya terbatas dan hambar, sementara pilihan makanan penutupnya sedikit dan kurang berkesan. Sarapan juga mengecewakan. Setelah menginap di The Westin Ubud dan Rimba Ayana, kami mengharapkan kualitas dan variasi yang serupa. Sayangnya, sarapan di sini kurang memuaskan. Yogurtnya kurang berasa, pilihan hidangan penutup dan kue keringnya minim dan tidak mengesankan, pilihan menu Barat terbatas dan monoton, dan bagian Indianya hambar. Ini adalah keluhan terbesar kami. Keluhan lainnya adalah waktu respons staf melalui email. Responsnya terkadang sangat lambat sehingga mengganggu tujuan menghubungi mereka. Saya sudah mengirim email kepada mereka tentang pengiriman tagihan akhir dan menanyakannya saat check-out, tetapi saya belum menerima balasan atau tagihan akhir, padahal sudah 4 hari sejak saya check-out. Aspek yang paling menonjol dari masa inap kami adalah pelayan yang sangat baik dan staf properti lainnya, yang selalu membantu dan penuh perhatian. Namun, mengingat masalah lainnya, pengalaman kami secara keseluruhan sangat mengecewakan. Saya harap manajemen memperhatikan masalah ini dan melakukan perbaikan yang diperlukan."
"584.","Sora Kim","5","2025-01-21","1","Sangat kecewa. Kolam renang seharusnya buka sampai jam 7 malam, tetapi ketika kami ke sana pukul 6.30 sore hari ini, handuknya sudah habis. Kami meminta handuk kepada staf, tetapi mereka bilang kolam renang sudah tutup. Jadi saya bertanya kepadanya, bukankah kolam renang seharusnya buka sampai jam 7 malam? Ada beberapa orang yang masih berenang juga. Namun, staf mengatakan tidak, kolam renang sudah tutup. Orang-orang yang sudah berada di kolam renang masih bisa berenang sampai jam 7 malam, tetapi tidak ada orang lain yang bisa masuk karena mereka akan membersihkan kolam renang. Sebaliknya, dia menyuruh saya pergi ke kolam renang di dekat klub pantai, di sana buka sampai jam 9 malam. Jadi saya bertanya untuk memastikan kepadanya, jika kolam renang di klub pantai, bukankah kita harus memesan terlebih dahulu untuk bisa menggunakan kolam renang? Dia bilang tidak, saya tidak perlu memesan apa pun karena kami adalah tamu. Kami pergi ke klub pantai setelah dia memastikan hal ini, dan sekali lagi kecewa. Pertama-tama, tidak ada seorang pun di pintu masuk. Tidak ada staf yang menyambut kami. Jadi kami harus mencari staf itu lagi. Ketika kami menemukan staf itu, kami bilang bahwa kami baru saja dari kolam renang utama dan staf di sana menyuruh kami berenang di sini. Namun, dia langsung mengatakan bahwa itu tidak benar. Kami harus memesan tempat untuk bisa berenang di sana… Kami membuang-buang waktu untuk pergi ke klub pantai, jadi tidak ada gunanya berdebat dengan staf di kolam renang. Lagipula saya tidak melihatnya ketika kami lewat. Tidak ada kemungkinan miskomunikasi dengan staf dalam hal ini. Saya orang Indonesia dan saya bertanya kepada staf dalam Bahasa Indonesia. Namun, ketika saya dan suami hendak kembali ke kamar, dia bilang mungkin sebaiknya kami bertanya dalam Bahasa Inggris dan berpura-pura tidak bisa berbahasa Indonesia. Yang tertulis di sana adalah kolam renang buka sampai jam 7 malam, dan memang seharusnya begitu. Jika ada informasi tentang waktu terakhir masuk kolam renang, seharusnya mereka menuliskannya dengan jelas, dan yang lebih penting lagi, resepsionis seharusnya memberi tahu saya ketika saya bertanya tentang jam buka kolam renang. 30 menit bukanlah waktu yang singkat. Kami harus berangkat pagi-pagi besok untuk terbang kembali, jadi malam ini adalah satu-satunya waktu kami bisa berenang. Namun, rencana kami berantakan. Saya anggota Accor Plus, dan saya hampir selalu memilih untuk menginap di Sofitel setiap kali bepergian. Saya rasa saya tidak akan pernah kembali ke Sofitel Bali."
"585.","EY","133","2024-01-21","1","Saya sudah memesan kamar di sini bulan Desember lalu. Saya ingin mengubah beberapa detail dan pengaturan kamar. Saya mendapati mereka lebih lambat dari yang saya harapkan untuk membalas. Harus menunggu sekitar 48 jam untuk pertanyaan yang relatif sederhana. Pembaruan Desember 2023: Menginap di sini selama seminggu. Hal baik: - restoran Italia - air kolam renang hangat - kamar luas Hal buruk: - kamar dan toilet kuno. - klub anak-anak bisa diperluas dan ditingkatkan. Hal yang sangat buruk: - kualitas makan malam prasmanan. Bagaimana mungkin lebih buruk daripada sarapan, terutama mengingat harganya. - staf check-in yang tidak membantu - pantainya. Pasirnya kasar dan keras. Begitu banyak batu dan kerang sehingga Anda benar-benar tidak bisa berjalan tanpa terluka. Alga hijau tersebar luas di pantai. Salah satu pantai terburuk yang pernah saya kunjungi. ------------------------ Saya rasa mereka tidak terlalu bersedia membantu atau berusaha keras untuk mengatasi masalah saya. Saya masih mempertimbangkan apakah saya harus membatalkan kunjungan dan pergi ke tempat lain di Nusa Dua. Sejauh ini saya tidak menikmati pengalamannya."
"586.","Shahd Anani","3","2025-01-21","1","Saya akan berbagi pengalaman saya yang membuat frustrasi dengan Sofitel Bali. Mereka kebanyakan mencari uang, tidak ada penawaran atau promosi yang nyata, dan selalu ada biaya tambahan yang harus dibayar. Kami ditawari promosi makan malam spesial dengan diskon untuk makan malam/makan siang kedua, Anda dapat melihat brosur terlampir yang mereka berikan kepada kami. Kami membayar makan malam dengan menu 3 hidangan untuk dua orang dan memilih restoran Cucina untuk makan malam. Menu tersebut memiliki biaya tambahan yang harus dibayar (jika Anda memilih sesuatu yang tidak standar) dan diskon tidak berlaku untuk makan malam kedua. Untuk kamar, mereka sama sekali tidak kedap suara. Kami bisa mendengar suara langkah kaki di koridor dan kami bisa mendengar suara air di pipa pembuangan setiap kali seseorang menyiram toilet. (Sangat romantis untuk liburan bulan madu). Stafnya kurang komunikatif dan kurang sopan santun untuk bersikap profesional, padahal seharusnya ini adalah hotel mewah bintang 5. Mengenai sarapan, kami tidak dapat menerima sarapan di kamar kecuali kami membayar sejumlah uang yang tidak wajar untuk mengantarkan sarapan yang telah kami bayar ke kamar."

Tiba pukul 13.00, saya diberitahu bahwa vila 2 kamar tidur kami belum siap. Tidak seperti hotel Accor lain yang menawarkan check-in lebih awal sebagai bonus, saya diminta menunggu selama 2 jam tanpa ruang tunggu/aktivitas yang memadai, sehingga kami hanya bisa berkeliling di tengah suhu 30 derajat. Proses check-in memakan waktu 45 menit yang mencengangkan dan sangat rumit. Mereka bersikeras meminta kartu kredit fisik yang digunakan untuk pemesanan, yang sudah ketinggalan zaman dan konyol di era digital saat ini. Secara keseluruhan, saya sangat kecewa dengan layanan dan kurangnya apresiasi terhadap anggota setia. Saya mengharapkan yang jauh lebih baik dari merek mewah seperti Sofitel."

"589.","Vanessa R.","12","2024-01-21","1","Awal yang buruk. Semoga membaik. Saya sering bepergian dan pernah menginap di tempat-tempat mahal, seperti homestay dan komunal. Ini hampir mendekati masa menginap saya selama sebulan di Bali, dan semua tempat di sana bagus, kecuali yang ini. Saya memutuskan untuk memanjakan diri dengan beristirahat sejenak di Sofitel Resort di Nusa Dua. Mereka menempatkan saya di kamar di atas area bar/pesta yang ramai. Rasanya seperti berada di klub. Karena lelah, saya meminta pindah, tetapi tidak mendapat respons sampai saya menelepon 3 kali. Mereka menunjukkan pilihan lain - di atas kamar keluarga dengan anak-anak bermain di kolam renang pribadi mereka. Kamarnya juga berisik. LALU ketika itu tidak berhasil, mereka menawarkan untuk memindahkan saya dari kamar tidur king yang sudah saya bayar ke kamar dengan dua tempat tidur twin yang disatukan! Tanpa menyebutkan pengembalian uang. Ini sungguh tidak profesional. Akhirnya setelah menolak pilihan tempat tidur twin ini, saya menemukan kamar yang tenang dengan tempat tidur king. Saya menerima kamar ini. Sebagai gantinya, mereka memberi saya voucher makan malam, hanya pilihan prasmanan. Awal yang buruk. Stafnya ramah, tapi ada yang kurang kalau kita menyuruh orang seenaknya begitu 👎🏽"

Punggung saya benar-benar sakit karena tempat tidurnya yang kecil ini. Kami meminta upgrade kamar dengan Pak Udayana untuk upgrade berbayar, tetapi dia tidak repot-repot membantu kami mengurangi biaya meskipun layanannya sangat buruk di sini. Tidak ada ruang untuk menyimpan koper di sini dan kami terus-menerus terbentur kaki karena ruang yang sempit. Tempat ini bahkan tidak pantas mendapatkan 1 bintang. Menuntut mereka adalah pilihan terbaik. Monster penghisap uang."

Kolam renangnya sudah tua dan anak-anak kami semua kakinya berdarah karena banyak sekali tepian yang tajam. Waktu tunggu rata-rata untuk makan siang atau makan malam adalah 1,5 jam. Kami menginap selama 10 malam dan meninggalkan restoran 3 kali setelah menunggu lebih dari 2 jam tanpa menerima makanan kami. Pelayanannya adalah yang terburuk yang pernah kami alami setelah 25 tahun bepergian (termasuk 5 perjalanan sebelumnya ke Bali). Jika Anda menghargai ketenangan Anda, kunjungi hotel lain."
"595.","Lilly","4","2025-01-21","1","Kami menginap di hotel Sofitel Nusa Dua selama delapan hari. Sayangnya, itu sangat mengecewakan. Tempat ini memiliki banyak sisi gelap dan kotor. Kolam renangnya berbau tembaga yang sangat menyengat, dan jika Anda mengenakan pakaian renang berwarna terang, warnanya akan berubah menjadi hijau setelah berenang. Hati-hati jika Anda berambut pirang; rambut saya langsung berubah hijau, dan itu bukan karena klorin—jika mereka memang menggunakan klorin sama sekali. Saya menduga mereka hanya menggunakan tembaga sulfat, karena baunya sangat menyengat. Saya menghabiskan tiga jam mencuci rambut sebelum bau hijau itu akhirnya hilang. Saya menyampaikan masalah ini ke pihak pengelola kolam renang empat kali, tetapi setiap kali saya hanya diberitahu bahwa kadar pH-nya baik-baik saja. Saya bertanya apa yang mereka campurkan ke dalam kolam renang, tetapi mereka selalu mengatakan bahwa mereka harus bertanya kepada staf kolam renang. Saya tidak pernah mendapatkan jawaban yang tepat. Prasmanan juga jauh dari harapan. Tidak ada yang didinginkan, dan menunya sama setiap hari. Mentega benar-benar meleleh dan encer seperti sup, tetapi kemudian dimasukkan kembali ke lemari es dan disajikan kepada pelanggan… Stafnya sangat ramah tetapi juga sangat tidak kompeten. Tidak ada penjaga pantai di kolam renang, dan banyak ubin yang hilang, sehingga menimbulkan bahaya. Kamar-kamar memiliki bau yang sangat menyengat, dan saluran pembuangan kamar mandi tersumbat. Setelah saya melaporkan masalah ini empat kali, akhirnya masalah tersebut teratasi. Kebersihan juga sangat mengecewakan… Lantainya kotor, kamar mandi belum dibersihkan dan masih ada rambut dari tamu sebelumnya, kerusakan akibat air di dinding, dan bahkan tidak ada segelas air gratis. Kami check-in pukul 11 ​​malam, dan semua orang sangat ramah, tetapi kemudian mereka mencoba menjual kamar dengan kolam renang dengan harga dua kali lipat dari harga yang saya bayar secara online, berulang kali menyebutkan bahwa itu adalah harga diskon khusus untuk kami… Secara keseluruhan, saya sangat kecewa dengan perjalanan ke Bali ini, dan bagi saya, ini jelas bukan hotel bintang 5. Saya tidak akan kembali dan tidak akan merekomendasikannya… Pasti ada hotel yang lebih baik di Bali. Tidak akan pernah lagi menginap di Sofitel!!!"

Meskipun telah dengan jelas menyatakan preferensi saya untuk kamar yang jauh dari area anak-anak melalui email sebelum kedatangan, staf hotel mengabaikan permintaan ini sepenuhnya dan menempatkan saya di kamar tepat di depannya. Kurangnya perhatian terhadap detail ini tidak dapat diterima untuk hotel bintang 5. Mereka kemudian meningkatkan kamar saya, tetapi kehilangan satu hari penuh dan layanan tidak membaik. Lebih lanjut, layanan di hotel sangat buruk. Keterlambatan penyajian makanan terus-menerus terjadi, yang menyebabkan pengalaman bersantap yang mengecewakan. Staf tampak tidak terorganisir dan tidak responsif terhadap kebutuhan tamu, gagal memberikan tingkat layanan yang diharapkan dari sebuah hotel mewah. Untuk mengatasi masalah saya, saya meminta alamat email manajer umum, Jean-Pierre Joncas, tetapi staf hotel langsung menolak untuk memberikannya. Kurangnya transparansi dan keengganan untuk meningkatkan masalah ini semakin menambah kekecewaan saya. Secara keseluruhan, kunjungan saya di Sofitel Nusa Dua diwarnai oleh layanan yang buruk, ketidakpedulian terhadap preferensi pelanggan, dan kurangnya akuntabilitas. Sebagai pelanggan setia Accor, ini adalah kesempatan terakhir saya untuk memberi kesempatan kepada merek ini, tetapi sayangnya, saya tidak akan kembali ke hotel ini."

Miskomunikasi, kebohongan dari staf senior, pengalaman bersantap yang buruk, nyamuk di ember es, dan kolam renang yang mulai rusak. Ini adalah hotel yang sudah lama diincar ibu saya. Kami berdua pernah ke Bali sebelumnya dan perjalanan ini benar-benar mengecewakan. Ini bukan 'kemewahan' dalam standar apa pun dan saya sarankan Anda untuk mempertimbangkan memesan tempat lain untuk liburan. Mungkin hotel ini menyenangkan saat masih baru, tetapi jelas standarnya telah menurun drastis.

Setelah lima malam, deposit telah terpakai, jadi kami menyetor lebih banyak uang ke kamar. Saat itu kami diberitahu bahwa diskon ini tidak berlaku untuk layanan kamar, promo happy hour, atau Manarai Beach House. Jika hal ini diberitahukan kepada kami saat check-in, kami akan membuat pilihan yang berbeda dan menghabiskan beberapa juta rupiah lebih sedikit. Area kolam renang - hebat. Makanan - sangat rata-rata. Kamar - lumayan tetapi ketinggalan jaman. Tidak akan kembali."

Saya mencoba menjelaskan bahwa kursi lipat tidak akan digunakan untuk anak-anak yang masih sangat kecil, tetapi mereka bersikeras. Mereka kemudian menjelaskan bahwa klub anak-anak hanya bisa digunakan selama 2 jam, setelah itu mereka akan menagih biaya. Saya tidak tahu bagaimana mereka akan memperlakukan kami dan tidak berani mencari tahu. Lagipula, siapa yang mau menginap di tempat di mana mereka mulai membacakan Syarat & Ketentuan bahkan sebelum kita sampai di sana? Mengingat banyaknya pilihan di Bali, kami memilih properti Bonvoy lainnya. Saya akan melewatkan malam gratis di Accor!"

Sangat mengecewakan karena spa hanya menawarkan 1 pijat, 1 spa kaki, dan 1 lulur tubuh selama 30 menit tanpa pilihan perawatan. Setelah berdebat panjang dengan manajer, mereka akhirnya menggantinya, tetapi secara keseluruhan pengalamannya kurang memuaskan. Berbicara tentang kamar, benar-benar bintang 1.. kamar tua, kepala pancuran rusak, wastafel tersumbat.. sangat menyedihkan. Bukan bagian terburuknya, yaitu pelayanan. Kamar kami dibiarkan terbuka setelah layanan kamar. Ketika kami mengeluh, manajernya memang meminta maaf, tetapi tidak lebih. Hotel lainnya memang memiliki pantai pribadi, tetapi ini adalah pantai terburuk di Nusa Dua. Rekomendasi saya adalah menghindari properti ini.

Dua hari kemudian, seluruh tubuh saya mulai gatal dan kaki saya terinfeksi parah. Kemudian saya harus ke dokter. Dokter mengganti biaya saya sebesar £165 poundsterling.

Baik saya dan pendamping saya merasa gatal sekitar pukul 3:00 pagi. Kami tidak bisa tidur nyenyak. Itu adalah masa menginap yang sangat melelahkan. Mengenai pengalaman sarapan, saya dapat mengatakan itu rata-rata. Tidak mengesankan. Berdasarkan pengalaman saya secara keseluruhan di sini, hotel ini ditampilkan jauh di bawah standar grup Sofitel. Itu adalah pengalaman Sofitel terburuk saya. Saya percaya, di Bali, hotel Marriott lebih baik untuk menginap daripada hotel Accor.

Saya makan Frito misto, yaitu makanan laut berlapis tepung roti dan pasta dengan makanan laut. Malam kedua kami makan di Kwee Zeen dan mencoba smorgasboard. Rasanya biasa saja. Pada malam kedua, kami menerima telepon dari resepsionis pukul 20.45 untuk menanyakan apakah kami membutuhkan sesuatu (waktu yang aneh untuk menelepon) yang saya jawab berupa teh jahe untuk membantu mengatasi sakit perut yang disebabkan oleh makanan di restoran mereka. Ketika tehnya tiba, saya dikenakan biaya $15. Secara keseluruhan, hotel ini indah dengan kolam renang yang indah dan layanan yang luar biasa, tetapi jangan makan di sini.

Layanan tamu sangat lambat dan selalu tertunda, cobalah memesan makanan dan menunggu lama untuk menerimanya. Layanan umum tidak memenuhi standar bintang 5. Tidak ada sambutan hangat, proses check-in memakan waktu. Sangat sulit untuk berkeliling resor. Sarapannya sangat standar. Antrean panjang untuk dilayani, kopi butuh waktu lama untuk datang. Secara keseluruhan, banyak tempat yang lebih baik di Bali dengan harga yang lebih murah. Peringkat keseluruhan tidak terlalu buruk. Perlu banyak perbaikan. PS: bahkan setelah manajer membalas ulasan saya, kami meminta check-out terlambat karena penerbangan kami terlambat hingga pukul 4 sore, mereka hanya menolak karena mereka tidak peduli.

(Kebisingan dari acara pembukaan klub pantai mereka merusak pengalaman menginap kami) Baru-baru ini, saya memanfaatkan promo beli 2 gratis 4 mereka untuk menginap lagi dan melihat apakah kali ini akan lebih baik. Meskipun kami tidak mengalami ketidaknyamanan apa pun selama menginap, saya rasa harga promo yang mereka tawarkan juga memberi kami pengalaman menginap yang promo. Saya menduga sebagian besar staf sekarang adalah karyawan magang, Anda bisa mengamati dari pengetahuan mereka tentang layanan hotel dan cara mereka menjawab (sesederhana akses klub anak-anak, mereka tidak yakin dengan jawaban mereka) Makanan saat sarapan hambar dan tidak ada yang istimewa, begitu pula dengan kopi yang disajikan. Desain kamar mungkin terlihat bagus di foto, tetapi fungsinya kurang ramah tamu/pengguna. Pusat kebugaran memiliki papan nama yang bertuliskan buka pukul 7 pagi, tetapi tidak pernah buka tepat waktu. Anda harus meminta bantuan staf untuk membukanya. Pusat kebugaran juga dalam kondisi yang sangat buruk. Tempat ATM sangat gelap, bawalah senter jika Anda perlu menarik uang. Saya menyayangkan kondisi hotel yang buruk akibat COVID-19, tetapi sebelum menginap di sini, kami menginap di hotel bintang 5 lain yang pelayanannya sangat baik, meskipun tingkat huniannya rendah dan bisnisnya juga sedang tidak bagus. (Ngomong-ngomong, kami senang menginap di hotel lain itu)."

Sangat mengecewakan karena kami mengharapkan liburan yang santai. Bahkan bisa terdengar dari kamar kami. Resor ini paling cocok untuk anak muda berusia 20 tahun, kalau saja harganya tidak terlalu mahal. Sayang sekali, padahal seharusnya bisa menyenangkan."
"613.","Seamus Denison","19","2023-01-21","1","***HOTEL TERBURUK DI BALI***. Ini adalah 2 hari terakhir dari petualangan 3 minggu saya di Bali dan saya merayakan ulang tahun saya di hotel yang saya kira mewah. Dari sambutan di tempat reservasi, pemesanan saya telah dibayar di muka atas nama saya karena itu adalah hadiah ulang tahun saya. Komunikasi melalui Sofitel sangat buruk. Saya harus membayar menginap dua malam dengan kartu kredit saya. Pemegang hadiah sangat malu dan tidak ada balasan email kepada mereka untuk menanyakan pemesanan mereka. Sambil menunggu kamar, ada acara Halloween Brunch dan saya memutuskan untuk mencobanya. KACAU! Staf berlarian untuk mengisi kembali prasmanan dan menabrak tamu (saya) beberapa kali. Lebih parahnya lagi, pelayan minuman kami mengatakan bahwa mereka terlalu banyak bekerja dan kurang dibayar. Akhirnya saya masuk ke kamar saya yang tertata rapi, meskipun saya harus memanggil petugas kebersihan setelah 10 menit karena kamar dipenuhi nyamuk dan saya digigit nyamuk sebanyak 20 kali. Petugas kebersihan hanya meninggalkan obat nyamuk di kamar dan saya bersikeras agar kamar disemprot dan kami bisa pergi sementara itu dilakukan. Petugas kebersihan kembali dengan semprotan dan pergi. TV tidak berfungsi, jadi saya harus menghubungi resepsionis lagi. Makan malam Senin malam, dari sambutan hingga perpisahan, tidak menyenangkan, makanan prasmanan tidak segar dan masih ada sisa makan siang semalam. Staf pelayanan hanya terdiri dari 5 pelayan untuk restoran berkapasitas 200 orang. Minuman selamat datang baru sampai di meja saya setelah memintanya di bar layanan. Layanan minuman selama satu jam saya berada di sana tidak ada sama sekali. Saya menunggu 10 menit untuk membayar tagihan. Tidur saya di malam terakhir terganggu oleh troli layanan yang melewati kamar saya pukul 5 pagi dan terus berderak melewati pintu. Saat check-out, saya berbicara dengan manajer resepsionis yang mengatakan bahwa saya telah menyampaikan banyak poin bagus dan email saya akan diteruskan ke Manajer Hotel. Manajer Hotel, Agus, membaca semua poin saya dan pada akhirnya memberi saya peningkatan kamar pada kunjungan saya berikutnya. Saya memiliki pengalaman 20 tahun di sektor Pariwisata dan saya belum pernah mengalami hal seperti di Nusa Dua Sofitel. Saya bepergian ke Bali beberapa kali setahun dan telah datang ke sini selama lebih dari 30 tahun. Berdasarkan pengalaman yang saya alami dari penyambutan hingga perpisahan, saya TIDAK AKAN PERNAH mengunjungi Sofitel Nusa Dua lagi. 1/10 Hotel ini membutuhkan manajemen baru karena apa yang saya alami tidak dapat diterima."

Balita saya terbentur kepalanya pada malam pertama di kamar 6025. Keponakan saya terpeleset di kamar yang sama karena lantainya terlalu licin akibat materialnya. Dagunya terbentur dan bengkak. Pintu penghubungnya terbuat dari gipsum, bukan kayu. Saya bisa mendengar petugas kebersihan tertawa dari kamar 2216, dan kami menginap di kamar 2215. Saya harus menegur mereka agar diam karena mereka sangat berisik. Kebersihannya sangat buruk. Banyak sekali debu! Meskipun lokasinya strategis dan kolam renangnya bagus, menurut saya pilihan materialnya tidak ramah untuk bayi atau setidaknya balita. Layanan saat sarapan juga sangat buruk. Kopi disajikan tanpa sendok teh. Detail-detail kecil seperti ini perlu diperhatikan."

"616.","Tm Dg","38","2025-01-21","1","Accor perlu meninjau kembali staf dan kualitas kamar mereka di Sofitel Bali. Saya harus pindah ke 5 kamar berbeda dalam 4 malam, merusak liburan saya. Setelah periode sibuk, saya memesan Sofitel Bali untuk bersantai dan menyegarkan diri. Sayangnya, ini adalah pengalaman unik dalam arti yang paling negatif. Dari saat manajer jaga menegur saya dan bahwa pelancong solo diremehkan karena pemesanan grup, hingga saat saya harus pindah ke 5 kamar berbeda dengan masing-masing kamar bermasalah; misalnya, Pintu penghubung yang tidak bisa ditutup, jadi saya mendengar semua yang dikatakan dan dilakukan tetangga saya, kebocoran air, dan pemadaman listrik pukul 2 pagi (meskipun terjadi pukul 5 sore dan staf mengatakan semuanya baik-baik saja)... semuanya di kamar yang berbeda... Staf memang memberikan beberapa solusi, tetapi setelah setiap solusi, muncul masalah lain... Saya hampir berkemas dan meninggalkan properti ini.... Meskipun beberapa staf berusaha sebaik mungkin untuk memberikan pengalaman positif terbaik kepada para tamu, beberapa staf sama sekali tidak peduli.... Rupanya ini pertama kalinya terjadi, tetapi ini seharusnya tidak terjadi sama sekali... Saya akan merekomendasikan Accor untuk memeriksa properti ini lebih dekat untuk memastikannya memenuhi standar kamar dan tingkat layanan yang diharapkan dari merek Sofitel. Staf dapat belajar dari properti lain di Indonesia seperti Movenpick Bali, Pullman Ciawi Vimala Hills, atau Fairmont Jakarta. Lain kali saya ke Bali, saya pasti akan menginap di properti yang berbeda."

Selain itu, ada retakan di meja rias batu dengan ujung tajam yang bisa melukai kulit, terutama anak saya. Kami juga mencium bau asap rokok yang memenuhi ruangan. Setelah membahas masalah ini dengan pihak manajemen, kami dipindahkan ke kamar lain. Namun, kamar mandi di kamar baru tersebut penuh kecoak, yang menunjukkan pengendalian hama dan kebersihan yang tidak memadai, mengingat kamar ini berada di lantai 3. Kami belum pernah mengalami begitu banyak masalah di hotel bintang 5, dan akibatnya, kami akhirnya mempersingkat masa inap kami dari 9 malam menjadi hanya 2 malam dan pindah ke hotel lain."

Saya tidak pernah menyangka akan mendapatkan pengalaman seburuk ini di hotel besar seperti Sofitel. Kamarnya bahkan tidak memenuhi standar hotel bintang 5, tidak ada kopi dan cangkir di kamar. Manajemen hotel yang buruk dan tidak terlalu memperhatikan tamu, bagi mereka Anda hanyalah nomor satu. Tidak sepadan dengan uang dan waktu, karena bagi kami, kami hanya merusak suasana hati dan harus pergi sarapan di luar hotel, karena mengantre telur selama 15 menit di pagi hari bukanlah hal yang menyenangkan."
"619.","Rohit Ghadge","12","2023-01-21","1","Kami pergi ke sana untuk merayakan ulang tahun pernikahan kami dan ulang tahun istri saya. Kami tidak mendapatkan kamar yang kami inginkan saat melakukan pemesanan jadi kami meminta hotel untuk meningkatkannya dan kami siap membayarnya tetapi mereka mengatakan Anda akan mendapatkan kamar dengan pemandangan taman saja karena kamar lain sudah dipesan, saya seperti ok itu adil, mereka tidak memiliki kamar yang tersedia. Tetapi kekecewaan yang sebenarnya dimulai ketika kami melihat kamarnya, cukup kotor, noda gel mandi di kaca kamar mandi, kamar dengan pemandangan taman tidak memiliki pemandangan taman, sebaliknya kami memiliki semua vila di depan kamar kami. Kulkas mereka tidak berisi apa pun. Ada retakan di dinding dekat stopkontak AC. Teh dan kopi yang disimpan di kamar adalah merek yang sangat normal. Kami pergi dan berbicara dengan salah satu anggota staf, menunjukkan padanya foto-foto kamar, dia menjadi sangat takut, kami diyakinkan olehnya bahwa dia akan berbicara dengan manajer dan melakukan sesuatu tentang hal itu tetapi ketika kami kembali ke hotel tidak ada yang menghubungi kami, tidak ada yang meninggalkan catatan untuk kami, tidak ada perubahan di kamar. Kami hampir membayar 480 USD hanya untuk menginap 2 malam dan kami memiliki ekspektasi yang sangat tinggi terhadap hotel ini. Kami merasa sedikit tersinggung ketika semua orang ditawari minuman selamat datang dan kami hanya disuruh duduk di salah satu sudut. Maksud saya, setidaknya itulah yang bisa Anda lakukan untuk menyambut tamu yang lelah. Kualitas sarapan mereka sungguh sangat buruk. Stafnya selalu kebingungan. Saya menunggu 15 menit hanya untuk menerima satu set peralatan makan baru. Meminta pasta saus putih yang lebih buruk, istri saya meminta omelet keju dan orang di stasiun telur memintanya untuk mengambil omelet sayuran sebagai gantinya, serius?? Mereka benar-benar merusak hari istimewa kami yang kami datangi ke sana. Pasti tidak akan kembali ke hotel menyedihkan ini."
"620.","Prana Jiwandhana","13","2021-01-21","1","Saya menghabiskan 2 malam untuk bulan madu saya pada bulan Desember 2016. Saya menginap di Honeymoon Suite. Ada empat hal yang mengecewakan saya. 1. Check-in sangat terlambat: Saya tiba di Sofitel pukul 13.00, dan kamar saya belum tersedia. Saya harus menunggu 3,5 jam hingga mereka mengizinkan saya masuk ke kamar (pukul 16.30). Sofitel tidak memberikan pengembalian uang dan layanan tambahan untuk mengatasi situasi ini. 2. Informasi palsu tentang restoran sarapan: Keesokan paginya, saya ingin sarapan di salah satu restoran Sofitel. Ketika saya tiba di restoran, staf memberi tahu saya bahwa meja sudah penuh, jadi dia mengarahkan saya ke restoran Sofitel lainnya. Kemudian saya bertanya apakah restoran kedua memiliki menu yang sama dengan yang pertama, dan dia menjawab ya. Keesokan harinya, saya berhasil masuk ke restoran pertama dan saya menemukan bahwa menunya berbeda dengan lebih banyak variasi makanan. Saya merasa staf mengolok-olok saya. 3. Layanan kamar yang kasar dan tidak suportif: Saya baru tahu kalau tidak ada pengering rambut di kamar saya. Jadi saya menelepon layanan kamar untuk meminta satu, dan dia bersikeras bahwa ada pengering rambut di kamar saya. Saya harus berdebat dengannya sampai akhirnya menyetujui permintaan saya. Saya tidak percaya saya mendapatkan layanan seperti ini dari hotel premium. 4. Tidak ada check-out terlambat: Setelah kekecewaan saya pada poin nomor 1, saya meminta check-out terlambat. Mereka tidak mengizinkan saya melakukan check-out terlambat. Singkatnya, saya tidak mendapatkan pengalaman yang menyenangkan setelah membayar mahal. Saya tidak akan merekomendasikan Sofitel Nusa Dua kepada siapa pun. Sejauh ini, ini adalah bagian terburuk dari bulan madu saya."

Bidet toilet, pengering rambut, lampu sudut yang terputus, tirai yang rusak, pembuka botol yang hilang. Makanan yang disajikan di Club Millésime tidak higienis dan banyak lalat! Seseorang telah menyebutkan bahwa kamar-kamar sudah usang dan saya sudah memperkirakannya, tetapi makanan yang disajikan dalam kondisi tidak higienis di Club Millésime adalah titik terendah baru di properti ini!"

Selain itu, staf di klub anak-anak sama sekali tidak membantu. Ketika Anda mengatakan Anda lupa kaus kaki, staf tidak akan memberi tahu Anda dapat membeli dari klub (Anda harus bertanya apakah mereka menjual atau tidak). Saya juga memperhatikan bahwa tidak semua orang dewasa memakai kaus kaki, tetapi kami diwajibkan sepanjang waktu. Rupanya, aturan mereka digunakan tergantung pada suasana hati staf. Jika Anda mengatakan tidak puas dengan aturan masuk dan layanan mereka, staf tidak akan mengatakan apa-apa selain ingin Anda pergi. Kami telah tinggal di lebih dari satu hotel di Bali, dan Sofitel Hotel adalah yang terburuk. Terlalu banyak aturan dan batasan, kurang bantuan dan hangat. Ini juga pertama kalinya saya begitu marah dan menulis ulasan panjang. Tidak akan memilih hotel ini lagi."

Manajer mengatakan bahwa ia akan menempatkan kami sejauh mungkin dari konstruksi, tetapi akhirnya ia menempatkan kami tepat di atasnya. Setelah itu, mereka malah memindahkan kami lebih jauh, yang memakan waktu sekitar satu jam. Dibandingkan dengan hotel-hotel terdekat di Nusa Dua, hotel ini yang terburuk. Bahkan tidak mencapai 3 ⭐️. Sulit untuk bersantai di sini. Sayang sekali waktu yang terbuang sia-sia."

Begitu saya membuka pintu kamar pertama, baunya sangat tidak sedap dan saya benar-benar melihat jamur. Saya harus meminta Anda untuk mengganti kamar saya karena membuat kami sakit kepala oleh jamur. Saat kami menunggu kamar baru, kami akan makan siang tetapi staf tidak mengizinkan saya duduk di restoran karena meja sudah disiapkan untuk makan malam pada pukul 3 sore. Seorang anggota staf menawarkan saya layanan kamar tetapi saya masih menunggu kamar baru. Pukul 4.15 sore saya mendapat pesan melalui aplikasi WhatsApp untuk mengambil kunci kartu kamar baru dari resepsionis. Saya berjalan turun tetapi mereka mengatakan itu belum dibaca. Saya harus kembali. Saya harus berjalan di sekitar hotel dari jam 2 siang dan saya merasa kesal dengan layanan gila ini. Saya akhirnya mendapatkan kamar baru pada jam 5 sore. Kami benar-benar kelelahan dan siang hari sudah berakhir. Kami memesan Laks dan Nasi Goreng untuk layanan kamar. Laksanya lembek dan kuahnya habis. Kami menyesal memilih Sofitel Nusa Dua. Hari ini yang saya rasakan hanyalah lelah, lapar, marah, dan sakit kepala di malam Natal. Saya mengerti ini musim ramai, tetapi Anda harus meningkatkan sistem dan layanan Anda. Saya senang menginap di Sofitel di negara lain, jadi saya biasanya memesannya saat bepergian, tetapi saya tidak yakin lagi. Saya kecewa. Banyak hotel lain yang seharusnya jauh lebih baik daripada di sini dengan harga yang lebih murah."

Kami memiliki kamar dengan akses kolam renang yang tidak memiliki kualitas hotel bintang 5. Tempat tidur yang sangat tua dan tidak nyaman (kami menginap selama 1 minggu, bayangkan apa yang kami rasakan sekarang), kamar yang bau. Saya tidak ingin menyebutkan air pancuran. Baunya seperti ada yang mati. Layanan penyambutan sangat sangat buruk. Ketika kami pertama kali masuk, kami menunggu dalam antrean selama 45 menit hanya untuk check-in. Ada 3 tempat Anda dapat makan. Sarapannya sangat enak. Tetapi 2 tempat lainnya, omg, kami memesan hidangan utama, hidangan utama, dan hidangan penutup. Pemesanan kami (ya, Anda harus memesan untuk masuk) pukul 19.30, kami menunggu hingga pukul 21.10 untuk hidangan utama kami. Ini tidak lambat. Jadi maaf tetapi tidak dapat menemukan kata-kata yang tepat untuk layanan ini. Kami frustrasi dengan semua layanan. Kami juga meminta check-out terlambat karena besok penerbangan kami pukul 22.00. Mereka bertanya kepada manajer mereka yang duduk di sebelah meja penyambutan tamu. Dia tidak memeriksa apa pun dan mereka mengatakan mereka tidak dapat menawarkan ini. Untuk detail selengkapnya, silakan ikuti saya. Saya akan berbagi lebih banyak. Saya penulis surat kabar online Australia Post. Jika Anda membayar sebanyak ini, Anda pantas mendapatkan lebih.

Kamarnya kuno - timbangan rusak, tempat sampo di kamar mandi rusak, TV hanya punya 1 saluran (tidak ada TV pintar??), seprai dan seprai bernoda, ketel tetapi tidak ada teh, kopi, susu. Kulkas mini bar tetapi kosong. Hanya 1 obat nyamuk yang tidak pernah diganti. Tisu toilet tidak pernah diisi ulang. Lampu di kamar tidak masuk akal untuk dinyalakan atau dimatikan - nyalakan lampu toilet di pintu depan! Dikunci di luar kamar oleh layanan kamar. Saya tidak mengenakan apa-apa selain handuk dan menunggu 1 jam sampai suami saya kembali untuk mengizinkan saya masuk. Masih menunggu kompensasi dari manajer yang dijanjikannya. Ubin di sekitar halaman licin. Saya terpeleset dan jatuh dua kali, kaki saya memar di salah satu air terjun. Sarapannya prasmanan. Beberapa makanan sudah terlalu lama didiamkan dan tidak enak - suami saya sakit setelah sarapan di hari ketiga. Kami memilih kopi dan croissant setelahnya karena itu adalah pilihan yang aman. Serangga menutupi buah untuk mendapatkan jus buah segar. Orang-orang menggunakan tangan mereka untuk mengambil makanan dan mengembalikannya - sangat tidak higienis. Makan malam di Kwee Zeen benar-benar mengecewakan - Jangan tanya tamu bagaimana mereka menginginkan steak mereka jika steaknya adalah steak sandwich! Makan malam di Toya fantastis, begitu pula stafnya. Staf di bar kolam renang dan sarapan prasmanan juga fantastis. Staf kebersihan sangat ramah - selalu menyapa dengan halo dan apa kabar. Dian dari Discovor Tour luar biasa, begitu pula tur yang dia pesan untuk kami. Eben, pemandu wisata kami, adalah aset berharga bagi Sofitel. Suami saya harus tinggal 3 hari tambahan setelah saya pergi. Dia menginap di Seminyak dan membayar setengah harga. Rumah semi-detached ini memiliki kamar mandi spa di kedua kamar. Smart TV di ruang tamu dan kedua kamar tidur serta pemutar DVD. Dia bilang makanannya benar-benar lezat. Kami sudah memesan untuk tahun depan, tetapi akan menginap di Seminyak."

Sayangnya, orang itu mengundurkan diri dan keadaan memburuk dengan cepat. Rupanya Sofitel tidak menunjuk penggantinya, atau penggantinya tidak mau melakukan tugasnya. Kami bahkan tidak bisa menghubungi staf kami kembali. Kami mencoba berkoordinasi dengan tiga orang berbeda di Sofitel, dan mereka terus saja mencoba mengalihkan kami ke orang lain. Pada satu titik, setelah semua frustrasi ini, seseorang menyuruh kami mengirim email! Tentu saja, tidak ada yang membalas email itu juga. Itu bukan layanan hotel bintang 5. Kami siap membayar deposit 30%, dan bahkan tidak bisa mendapatkan kontrak dari siapa pun. Gila sekali, kan? Di tengah pandemi ketika semua hotel juga sedang berjuang. Semoga ulasan ini membantu pasangan lain menghindari bencana ini. Gelar pernikahan Anda di tempat yang menghormati dan menghargai Anda."
"632.","Jennie Wong","7","2023-01-21","1","Kami menginap di Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua dari 24/10/2022 hingga 31/10/2022. Penerbangan kami dari Bali pada 31/10 adalah malam hari. Sekitar tanggal 26/10 atau 27/10, kami bertanya kepada resepsionis apakah kami bisa melakukan check-out terlambat pada 31/10. Kami diberitahu bahwa hal itu dapat diatur dengan biaya tambahan jika kami memberi tahu resepsionis satu hari sebelum check-out. Pada 29/10, suami saya mulai merasa tidak enak badan dan pada 30/10 kami pergi ke Rumah Sakit Siloam di Nusa Dua. Ia mengalami demam 38 derajat. Pada 30/10, kami pergi ke resepsionis Sofitel untuk membayar biaya check-out terlambat. Saya memberi tahu resepsionis bahwa suami saya sedang tidak enak badan dan kami membutuhkan kamar untuknya beristirahat. Kemudian kami diberitahu bahwa kamar-kamar sudah penuh. Kami kemudian berhasil menemukan hotel lain yang dapat menampung kami hingga malam hari. Akan lebih bijaksana dan membantu jika Sofitel dapat kembali memberi tahu kami lebih awal bahwa mereka telah memesan kamar dan menanyakan apakah kami masih ingin melanjutkan check-out terlambat, sebelum mengalokasikan kamar untuk tamu berikutnya. Saya sebenarnya bertanya kepada hotel lain yang melayani kami di hari terakhir, apa yang akan mereka lakukan jika ada tamu yang tidak sehat yang meminta check-out terlambat dan bersedia membayarnya. Namun, kamar mereka sudah penuh. Mereka mengatakan akan berusaha sebaik mungkin untuk mencari kamar di hotel saudara mereka. Pendekatan yang jauh lebih bijaksana dan tentunya penuh kasih sayang."
"633.","Claire Dew","74","2023-01-21","1","Resepsionisnya kurang ramah. Saya dialokasikan kamar twin bed, butuh waktu lebih dari satu jam untuk memilih kamar lain untuk kamar king. Memang di pemesanan tertulis kamar Deluxe, tapi seharusnya dia bertanya dan mengonfirmasi kamar yang mana saat check-in. (Twin atau king) meskipun kami berdua sedang berduaan dan menatapnya saat check-in. Tidak bisa memesan restoran BBQ karena sudah penuh untuk 2 malam, jadi saya harus berjalan kaki ke hotel lain untuk makan malam. Saya memesan sarapan prabayar, dan saya senang membayar ekstra untuk diantar ke kamar karena sarapannya penuh di restoran dan semua orang menyentuh peralatan makan di prasmanan, jadi sangat tidak higienis untuk flu dan COVID. Tapi ternyata tidak, mereka bilang saya harus membayar LAGI dengan jumlah penuh jika saya ingin sarapan diantar ke kamar 🤷‍♀️ … mereka perlu mengubah aturan itu sesegera mungkin karena sarapan prasmanan adalah tempat yang rawan penularan COVID. Mesin kopi rusak jadi tidak ada cappuccino yang tersedia 🙈 WiFi-nya lambat, jadi saya hanya menggunakan kuota internet saya sendiri untuk rapat. Tidak ada pembersih tangan di mana pun, dan ketika saya menemukannya, semuanya kosong atau rusak. Saya pergi ke restoran untuk makan siang. Tidak ada meja untuk duduk di luar! Hanya kursi rendah atau kursi berjemur. Tidak ada meja sama sekali. Mereka menagih tagihan saya ke kamar, lalu 1 jam kemudian ada telepon yang mengatakan saya tidak bisa melakukannya. Sangat membingungkan karena saya senang membayar saat itu juga. Saya diganggu oleh 9 panggilan tak terjawab yang menuntut pembayaran segera meskipun saya sudah memberikan kartu kredit saya saat check-in. Saya pergi untuk pijat, bertanya apakah mereka sibuk, dia bilang tidak, jadi saya pergi jalan-jalan. Sekembalinya saya, saya memesan pijat dan dia bilang sudah penuh untuk beberapa jam ke depan… 🤷‍♀️ Pro - Kamarnya luas, tetapi pencahayaannya sangat sulit digunakan. Lokasinya bagus dan area resornya indah. Sayangnya, saya harus menginap di sini lagi bulan depan untuk konferensi lain yang tidak saya nantikan. Semoga lebih baik. Satu hal yang saya alami untuk pertama kalinya, masuk ke hotel dengan suasana hati yang baik dan pulang dengan perasaan stres dan kesal karena seluruh proses menginap di sana sungguh melelahkan. Saya lebih suka hotel yang praktis!"
"634.","Matthew Aldo Susabda","58","2023-01-21","1","Saya menulis ulasan ini berdasarkan pengalaman pribadi (total 5 malam), jadi ulasan ini sepenuhnya subjektif dan pengalaman Anda mungkin berbeda dengan saya. Saya sudah beberapa kali menginap di Ap*rva, juga pernah ke Fo*r Seas*ns, Conr*d, W*stin, Gr*nd Hy*tt, dan H*lton. Jadi, sulit untuk tidak membandingkan. Nah, bagi saya, Sofitel sebagai hotel resor bintang 5 tidak sebanding dengan mereka. Pasti tidak akan kembali lagi. Makanan: Saya sarapan di Club Millesime pada pagi pertama dan sayangnya salah satu dari tiga pesanan saya tidak jadi. Sarapan di Kweezeen hampir setiap hari kacau (ngomong-ngomong, ini musim liburan), cukup sulit untuk mendapatkan mentega. Sisi positifnya, restoran mereka (Cucina dan Toya) menyajikan makanan dan layanan yang enak, saya menikmatinya. Layanan: Menurut saya, 40% stafnya tidak ramah, senyumnya minim. Saya bertanya 4-5 kali tentang pembuat kopi Webber di kamar, tetapi tidak ada yang tahu cara menggunakannya. Tidak mendapatkan layanan merapikan kamar pada pukul 5 sore, meskipun saya tidak ada di kamar. Yang terburuk, pada hari keempat, kamar saya terkunci tanpa alasan yang jelas. Hari itu keluarga saya berencana pergi ke kebun binatang. Pukul 08.00 saya keluar untuk sarapan, pukul 09.00 saya kembali untuk mengambil beberapa barang, mematikan lampu, dan memasang tanda ruang rias di gagang pintu, tetapi kartu saya tidak berfungsi, lampu oranye. Pergi ke meja resepsionis di Club Millesime, mereka bilang akan mengirim teknisi, menunggu selama 20 menit, tidak ada yang datang. Saya memberi tahu salah satu staf tata graha yang lewat untuk memberi tahu meja resepsionis tentang masalah ini dan meminta mereka untuk merapikan kamar nanti. Coba tebak? Kembali pada pukul 19.00, kamar masih terkunci. Kembali ke resepsionis, menunggu teknisi, kamar dibuka, dan... kamar tidak dibersihkan dengan kartu yang ditempel di pintu yang mengatakan staf tidak bisa membersihkan kamar karena lampu jangan diganggu menyala. Broooooo, itu karena saya tidak bisa masuk kamar, jadi saya ingatkan kalian. Check out jam 11.00, tapi check in jam 15.00?! Ayolah... ini resor bintang 5 di Bali. Ini pertama kalinya saya menulis ulasan panjang dan memberi 1 bintang seperti ini karena suasana liburan saya jadi hancur. Mungkin kalau saya bule, mereka akan memperlakukan saya lebih baik. Catatan tambahan: Spa-nya super bagus oleh Bu Nur, tapi tidak membantu kesan saya terhadap hotel ini."
"635.","Jasmine Png","59","2023-01-21","1","Ini akan menjadi kunjungan pertama (sayangnya) dan terakhir saya ke hotel ini, dan saya harap ulasan ini akan meyakinkan beberapa dari Anda untuk tidak menginap di hotel ini, yang sangat mengecewakan saya. Sedikit latar belakang: Saya bepergian dengan balita berusia 2 tahun dan ini adalah pemberhentian terakhir saya di Bali, dengan kami menghabiskan 3 malam di Sofitel. Sebelumnya, kami berada di daerah pegunungan Munduk dan perjalanannya panjang dan melelahkan (jika berkendara sendiri) meskipun sempat berhenti beberapa kali untuk makan dan istirahat. Jadi, kami sangat menantikan kunjungan kami di Sofitel. Setibanya di Sofitel: Senang melihat petunjuk arah yang jelas menuju lobi Sofitel, dan lega ketika diberitahu bahwa akan ada layanan valet, jadi saya tidak perlu khawatir tentang parkir dan cukup menitipkan mobil. Namun, kelegaan itu hanya sesaat. Kami diantar ke area resepsionis oleh staf untuk check-in, tetapi karena semua konter sudah penuh, kami diminta untuk menunggu di area sofa. Balita saya sekarang, karena perjalanan panjang, sangat gelisah, dan tentu saja suasana hati saya juga sedang tidak baik karena saya harus terus-menerus menenangkannya. Ketika pelanggan baru berdatangan, mereka langsung dilayani sementara keluarga saya menunggu, mengira akan ada yang memanggil kami saat giliran kami tiba. Baru setelah sekitar 15-20 menit kami merasa ada yang tidak beres dan mulai mendekati salah satu konter. Kami sangat kecewa ketika menyadari tidak ada staf yang tahu keberadaan kami, dan staf sebelumnya tidak menyerahkan dengan benar ke konter check-in. Baiklah, mari kita lanjutkan. Kamar: jadi saya tidak yakin apakah karena wajah kesal saya saat check-in yang membuat kami mendapatkan kamar yang kurang diinginkan (Nomor 1101). Oke, jadi tidak ada pemandangan, tidak apa-apa, kami bisa mengatasinya, saya hanya membayar USD$200/malam. Saya kecewa karena mereka tidak menyadari bahwa saya punya balita, yang perlu tidur siang setiap hari, dan memberi kami kamar tepat di sebelah area renovasi. Akibatnya, balkon saya sangat berdebu dan kebisingan yang dihasilkan dari renovasi membuat balita saya tidak bisa beristirahat, dan saya rasa saya harus menghadapi amukannya. Berikut daftar hal-hal lain yang perlu diperbaiki: (1) Keran berlumut, pancuran hujan, dan tombol siram toilet (2) Kotak tisu tidak ergonomis, menyebabkan semuanya macet (3) Tidak ada pasokan air panas di hari pertama (4) Nomor concierge tidak bisa dihubungi meskipun sudah berkali-kali dihubungi (ketika ingin bertanya tentang (3)) Sejujurnya, kami sebenarnya rela melewati hal-hal di atas karena hanya menginap 3 malam. Tapi hal-hal berikut ini benar-benar membuat saya kesal, dan mendorong saya untuk menulis ulasan ini (saya masih marah sekali): (5) Tidak ada yang melayani kami dari konter valet ketika kami berkendara kembali ke hotel dari perjalanan sehari kami di hari kedua. Prioritas diberikan kepada tamu yang baru check-in yang berada di belakang kami. Kami ditinggalkan tak berdaya di sana dengan balita yang rewel. (6) Tidak ada layanan tata rias kamar!!! Setelah kembali ke kamar pukul 1 siang, kami sangat kecewa karena kamar kami masih belum dirapikan. Kami memastikan lampu DND tidak menyala (sakelarnya tidak diberi label dan Anda perlu mencoba-coba untuk mengetahuinya, termasuk tombol DND yang bentuknya sama dengan sakelar lampu) sebelum kami melanjutkan perjalanan di pagi hari. Saat menghubungi petugas concierge, kami diberi tahu bahwa layanan tata rias seharusnya dilakukan mulai pukul 9 pagi dan staf mungkin melewatkan kamar kami saat mereka sedang melakukan ronda. Meskipun mereka menawarkan untuk melakukannya segera atau nanti, pengalaman saya sejauh ini sungguh mengecewakan dan ini adalah titik puncaknya dan semoga tidak ada orang lain yang mengalami hal yang sama seperti saya. Sebagai penutup, setelah berjalan di sepanjang pantai, kami dapat melihat semua hotel lain di sepanjang pantai memiliki kualitas yang serupa (dari segi pemandangan, bukan layanan). Oleh karena itu, saya sarankan Anda untuk mempertimbangkan memesan hotel lain di sepanjang pantai dan Anda akan mendapatkan pengalaman dan pemandangan pantai yang serupa. Selain itu, kami memiliki kesan yang sangat baik tentang Sofitel di Singapura, tetapi pengalaman ini benar-benar merusak keseluruhan kesan. P.s. Saya baru menginap di hari kedua, tetapi hotel ini sudah memberi saya peringkat bintang 1 atau lebih rendah; semoga saya bisa bertahan selama dua malam tersisa!"
"636.","Ирина Ситнова","5","2023-01-21","1","Saya terkesan dengan kunjungan sejauh ini! Kami pergi ke restoran hotel ini di malam hari, kami sedang memilih hotel untuk menginap selama sebulan, karena kami tidak pernah menemukan vilanya! Semua keinginan itu sirna, gara-gara suatu kejadian buruk, yang bahkan tidak saya temui di Varunga. Mereka meminta kelapa muda untuk anak itu, tidak dingin, kami diberitahu bahwa mereka sudah membekukan semuanya. Kemudian mereka meminta air panas untuk mengencerkan kelapa muda. Akibatnya, sebotol besar air mineral Balian sudah termasuk dalam tagihan. Ketika ditanya dari mana Anda mendapatkan air panas saya, mereka menjawab - dari mesin kopi. Kemudian saya meminta mereka untuk membawakan apa yang telah mereka buat. Hampir semua staf datang dan mulai menjelaskan bahwa Anda tidak puas dengan kelapa muda yang dingin, lalu membayar airnya. Kesalahpahaman seperti itu meniadakan semua kesan tentang hotel bintang 5 ini. Kami adalah pemegang status Marriott, di jaringan hotel ini, staf tidak pernah membiarkan diri mereka serendah ini. Namun, ada kegagalan serius dalam sistem ini, yang terpenting adalah manajemen hotel! Tolong jelaskan kepada mereka terlebih dahulu: tidak semua orang minum minuman dingin, apalagi anak-anak! Anda sendiri yang harus mendinginkan semuanya sekaligus. Sangat rendah dan tidak masuk akal! Tentu saja, staf dengan demikian mendapatkan pendapatan tambahan, dan ini, dengan segala hormat kepada jaringan hotel ternama, sangat tidak masuk akal dan bodoh."

Selama saya bulan madu di bali , hotel sofitel sangat mengecewakan .untuk teman teman yang ingin berlibur dan menginap di sofitel bisa mempertimbangkan lagi jika keadaan lagi high seasond ,pelayanan menururn di Banding Sebelum ny. Kami menginap dari tanggal 29 hingga 30 April. Setibanya di sana, kami menitipkan barang bawaan kami di konter hotel, dan mereka memberi kami label bagasi. Kami check-in pukul 10.40, tetapi kamar belum siap. Karena saya dan istri akan pergi, staf hotel mengatakan akan menelepon kami jika kamar sudah siap. Kami meminta label bagasi dan mengatakan akan menitipkannya di kamar. Sekitar pukul 13.00, mereka menelepon kami untuk mengonfirmasi bahwa kamar sudah siap. Pukul 21.30, kami kembali ke hotel dan mengambil kartu kamar. Setibanya di kamar, bagasi kami tidak ada (belum diantar) dan beberapa lampu rusak. Kami menelepon staf dan diberi tahu bahwa bagasi kami belum diantar. Setelah menunggu lama, mereka masih belum datang, jadi saya pergi ke lobi untuk mengambilnya sendiri (Anda bisa memeriksa CCTV di hotel). Kami sangat kecewa. Ini bukan seperti hotel bintang 5. Jika Anda mencari liburan yang santai, saya sangat merekomendasikan hotel ini. Anggota Platinum - Anggota Seasara Klasik Tanggal check-in: 29 April 2022 Tanggal check-out: 30 April 2022 Setibanya di hotel, saya menitipkan barang bawaan dan memberikan label bagasi. Kemudian, saya check-in sekitar pukul 10.40, tetapi kamar saya belum siap. Karena saya dan istri akan pergi ke luar hotel, staf mengatakan akan menelepon ketika kamar saya siap. Sekitar pukul 13.00, staf hotel menelepon dan mengatakan kamar saya sudah siap. Mereka meminta label bagasi saya agar dapat mengirimkan barang bawaan saya ke kamar. Saya kembali ke hotel pukul 21.30, lalu meminta kunci kamar. Sesampainya di kamar, saya mendapati barang bawaan saya tidak ada, dan lebih parahnya lagi, salah satu lampu kamar mati. Lalu saya menelepon mereka untuk meminta barang bawaan saya dikirim ke kamar. Setelah menunggu cukup lama, tidak ada yang datang. Jadi saya pergi ke ruang penyimpanan barang bawaan dan mengambil barang bawaan saya sendiri. (Staf hotel dapat memeriksa dari CCTV apakah saya melakukan hal yang benar atau tidak) Saya sangat kecewa dengan layanan yang diberikan Sofitel kali ini. Rasanya seperti penurunan kualitas bagi saya. Saya sempat berbulan madu di Bali, dan menginap di beberapa hotel bintang lima, tetapi Sofitel adalah yang terburuk. Bagi siapa pun yang berencana berlibur dan menginap di Sofitel, sebaiknya pertimbangkan kembali, terutama selama periode musim ramai. Layanannya tidak sebaik dulu."

Saya menginap di sini selama 6 malam (24-30 Oktober 2020), tetapi layanannya buruk. Tidak ada kue selamat datang untuk layanan platinum. Makanan yang disajikan di kamar dingin dan hambar. TV dan saluran telepon tidak berfungsi sama sekali. Saya menemukan kelabang di kamar dan kadal besar (biawak) di kolam renang, dan tidak ada tanggapan langsung dari manajer. Stafnya juga tidak membantu dalam kasus ini. Hotel ini memberikan layanan yang baik kepada selebritas yang dipromosikan untuk mempromosikan hotel ini (teman saya), tetapi tidak kepada tamu yang benar-benar membayarnya!"
"640.","Win Sinatra","9","2018-01-21","1","Sofitel Nusa Dua kurang rapi dan kurang memperhatikan detail. Hotel ini sangat mengecewakan dan sungguh memalukan untuk sebuah hotel yang disebut mewah. Untuk hotel bintang 5 dengan harga yang ditawarkan, kualitasnya sangat pas-pasan. Layanan tata graha sangat lambat, terutama saat meminta perlengkapan toilet. Saya harus bertanya 3-4 kali sebelum perlengkapan datang. Kebersihan kamar sangat buruk. Saya harus menggosok bak mandi sendiri sebelum menggunakannya untuk pertama kali karena ada residu atau kotoran yang menumpuk, mungkin disebabkan oleh tamu sebelumnya. Beberapa bagian kamar tampak seperti telah dibersihkan secara menyeluruh selama berbulan-bulan karena debu yang menempel dapat menumpuk, terutama saat jari-jari Anda menyisir meja kopi. Belum lagi, Anda akan menemukan sarang laba-laba di sudut-sudut kamar. Selain itu, pembaca kunci dan kartu kunci kamar saya tiba-tiba berhenti berfungsi di hari terakhir saya menginap dan mengunci pasangan saya di luar kamar. Untungnya, saya ada di dalam kamar untuk membukanya. Jika Anda menginap saat liburan tahun baru, ada jamuan makan malam wajib yang harus Anda hadiri dengan biaya tambahan. Sekali lagi, untuk harga yang Anda bayar, kualitas makanannya mengecewakan, misalnya hidangan lautnya tidak segar dan pilihan makanan lainnya kurang menarik. Sarapannya lumayan, tapi kebersihannya sangat buruk - ada kotoran burung di meja kami yang tidak dibersihkan saat meja ditata. Tidak akan merekomendasikan hotel ini kepada siapa pun. Sebaiknya Anda coba Movenpick untuk menginap. Harganya setengahnya, tetapi kualitasnya jauh lebih baik. Atau Hotel Mulia di Nusa Dua adalah tempat menginap yang jauh lebih baik."
"641.","UTKARSH AGARWAL","44","2023-01-21","1","Ini adalah properti Sofitel terburuk di dunia. Kamar saya tidak ber-AC selama menginap, bahkan setelah staf berusaha memperbaikinya. Bayangkan cuaca Bali tanpa AC, bahkan kamar hostel pun ada AC di sini. Stafnya sama sekali tidak menunjukkan simpati, empati, dan sopan santun. Alih-alih menawarkan penggantian kamar, mereka malah menyalahkan pergantian shift dan mengklaim hanya kamar ini yang bermasalah, seolah-olah saya yang diberi kamar itu atas pilihan saya sendiri. Teknisi yang mencoba memperbaiki AC tidak hanya gagal melakukannya, tetapi juga meninggalkan wastafel kamar mandi yang sangat kotor dan bernoda, dan tidak sopan untuk membersihkannya. Selain AC, mereka bahkan tidak repot-repot menyediakan fasilitas dasar seperti kantong teh, bubuk kopi, atau gula, apalagi mengisi minibar berbayar. Manajer jaga bahkan tidak sopan untuk meminta maaf dan mencoba membeli jalan keluar dari mimpi buruk ini dengan menawarkan tumpangan taksi seharga 5 dolar ke bandara. Saya pikir Accor Group benar-benar perlu merombak manajemen properti ini, jika tidak, seluruh merek mereka akan menjadi taruhannya."

"643.","sticky bear","154","2023-01-21","1","Saya baru-baru ini menginap di Sofitel Nusa Dua. Karena Australia membuka kembali perbatasannya, saya memutuskan untuk mengunjungi Bali untuk Perjalanan Keluarga Pertama kami setelah Lockdown untuk menghabiskan waktu berkualitas bersama 4 anggota keluarga lainnya. Kami memesan 3 Kamar King Mewah dengan Pemandangan Laut. Dari hari pertama check-in di Sofitel pada tanggal 30 Juni hingga 4 Juli, masa inap kami dipenuhi masalah demi masalah. Hal ini menyebabkan masa inap kami sangat tidak menyenangkan. Pengalaman ini meninggalkan kesan yang sangat buruk karena sama sekali tidak dapat diterima untuk sebuah Resor Mewah Bintang 5 seperti Sofitel Nusa Dua. Standarnya sangat buruk sehingga saya rasa hal ini perlu diperhatikan semua orang! 1. Putri saya yang berusia 25 tahun dan pasangannya kehilangan separuh koper berisi pakaian bermerek dan uang tunai AUD 500 setelah petugas kebersihan membersihkan kamar mereka, yang mana Sofitel menolak semua tanggung jawab. Saat itu sudah waktunya check-out dan kami bergegas membersihkan kamar pukul 10 pagi, kami juga sudah memesan perawatan Spa, dan terlebih lagi, kami harus mengejar penerbangan. Manajer jaga datang ke kamar kami dan memberi tahu kami bahwa ini sudah pernah terjadi sebelumnya dan putri saya seharusnya mengunci kopernya. Mereka akan mencoba memeriksa CCTV. Saya bilang, tentu saja mereka akan mengenakan pakaian curian di dalam seragam mereka, memasukkannya ke dalam kantong sampah, dll. Manajer jaga menjawab bahwa mereka akan pergi ke rumah staf dan melakukan penggeledahan. Awalnya, ia berempati dan mengatakan akan berbicara dengan Manajemen Tinggi dan akan menghubungi kami kembali. Nada bicaranya berubah setelah berkonsultasi dengan Manajemen dan menyangkal semua tanggung jawab. Kami ingin membuat laporan kehilangan dan pencurian, tetapi pihak hotel menolak membantu kami, dan meminta kami untuk pergi ke kantor polisi setempat dan membuat laporan sendiri. Manajer jaga dan Manajer keamanan menolak untuk membantu kami lebih lanjut. Saat kami melanjutkan perjalanan ke Singapura dan Malaysia, putri saya dan pasangannya menemukan semakin banyak barang yang hilang dari koper mereka, termasuk uang tunai AUD500, yang ingin mereka gunakan untuk menukar mata uang untuk berbelanja di Malaysia. 2. Sebuah pengisi daya portabel tertinggal di meja makan kamar hotel ketika kamar kami diganti karena kebersihan yang buruk dan masalah kebocoran. Pengisi daya dicuri dari kamar beberapa menit setelah kami menyadari bahwa kami meninggalkannya di meja makan, dan kami pun mengadu kepada Manajer Tugas. Ia mengaku tidak ada di kamar, dan sekali lagi, tidak ada tindakan yang diambil. 3. Kamar kami (kamar lama dan kamar yang sudah diganti) memiliki berbagai masalah seperti perlengkapan kamar mandi bekas setelah check-in, kamar mandi bocor dari pancuran, kebersihan dan higiene yang buruk, handuk kotor bernoda serangga dan riasan, kopi/teh dan perlengkapan mandi yang tidak diisi ulang, pemandangan laut yang buruk meskipun kami sudah membayarnya, pintu geser rusak yang tidak bisa dikunci, tidak ada peredam suara yang menyebabkan kami terbangun dengan suara bising di pagi hari, belatung dan telur serangga di meja makan, botol air pecah yang tidak dibersihkan selama beberapa jam meskipun kami sudah meminta beberapa kali, tumpahan kopi besar di lantai yang tidak dibersihkan setelah menghubungi petugas kebersihan. 4. Saya mendapati pintu kamar saya dibiarkan terbuka sedikit setelah barang bawaan saya dikirim ke kamar. Ini mengkhawatirkan mengingat seseorang, siapa pun, bisa saja mencuri barang bawaan kami atau sesuatu dari kamar. Standar keselamatan dan keamanannya sangat minim, kami merasa barang-barang pribadi kami tidak aman selama menginap di Sofitel, pertama PENCURIAN dan sekarang ini. 5. Layanan makan ala carte di Kweezeen sangat lambat. Kami harus menunggu untuk memesan, lalu harus meminta makanan beberapa kali, dan setiap kali para pelayan mengangguk tanda setuju tetapi tidak pernah kembali untuk melayani kami. 6. Seorang anggota keluarga mendaftar untuk salah satu sesi yoga di Sofitel. Waktu yang diberitahukan staf saat pendaftaran salah, dan ketika anggota keluarga saya pergi untuk menghadiri, diberitahu bahwa sesinya sudah selesai. Saya sedang mencari penasihat hukum sekarang tentang LIBURAN KAMI YANG HANCUR dan BARANG-BARANG YANG DICURI, kami juga ketinggalan penerbangan karena semua drama ini! TIDAK AKAN PERNAH LAGI, AKANKAH KAMI MENGINAP DI SOFITEL LAIN!"

Terlebih lagi, kamar tersebut bahkan belum siap untuk tamu baru. Ada keset basah bekas di kursi dan perlengkapan mandinya belum siap, jadi sepertinya mereka memaksakan kamar yang belum siap untuk kami. Deposit untuk 4 kamar juga tampaknya hanya dibebankan pada 1 kamar. Kami harus menjelaskan kepada setiap layanan kamar, petugas bar kolam renang, dan petugas restoran bahwa deposit tersebut untuk kamar yang lain. Pada hari terakhir, kami hanya diberi waktu check-out hingga pukul 13.00, tetapi pada pukul 12.00, kami bahkan tidak bisa menggunakan semua kunci lagi. Mohon maaf, Sofitel Bali belum mempertahankan standar bintang 5 seperti dulu."

Jelas tidak dapat diterima. o Petugas kebersihan datang sekitar 30 menit kemudian untuk mengganti seprai, dan harus menggunakan 4 set seprai yang berbeda untuk menemukan satu set seprai yang bersih. o Saya mengerti bahwa ini adalah layanan outsourcing, namun mencerminkan kurangnya kontrol kualitas oleh Sofitel saat meletakkan seprai bersih di tempat tidur. o Keesokan paginya setelah mandi, saya harus meminta handuk kami diganti karena kotor. o Jelas kamar tidak memenuhi standar minimum hotel bintang 5 sebagaimana mestinya. • Waktu untuk makan a la carte di Kwee Zeen, Toya, dan melalui layanan kamar semuanya melebihi 45 menit untuk pesanan sederhana seperti sup. Di restoran, terkadang waktu tunggunya lebih dari 1 jam, dan makanan tidak pernah diantar bersamaan. Makanan selalu datang dengan jeda waktu yang cukup lama. Ini berarti satu orang makan sementara yang lain menunggu, hal ini sangat tidak nyaman. • Waktu yang dibutuhkan staf Resepsionis untuk melakukan sesuatu sangat lama dan tampak senang membuang-buang waktu berharga tamu. o Ini termasuk Manajer Resepsionis Tri dan Yumi yang memberikan berbagai janji untuk terus-menerus mengecewakan kami. Tri khususnya sangat cepat menyerahkan semua tanggung jawab penanganan barang kepada staf tingkat bawah, kinerjanya sangat buruk. o Secara keseluruhan, staf Resepsionis menyampaikan pesan yang tidak konsisten kepada tamu yang mencerminkan kurangnya pelatihan tentang proses. Manajer menunjukkan kurangnya kepemimpinan dan inisiatif dan terus-menerus membuat alasan untuk barang-barang yang menjadi kesalahan orang lain, bukan kesalahan hotel. o Secara keseluruhan, Manajer Resepsionis Anda berbohong, memanfaatkan situasi, dan sengaja menyesatkan. • Juga mencatat ketika saya check-out, yang memakan waktu 1 jam, tamu lain mengalami masalah yang sama persis dengan saya. Jelas prosesnya rusak. Secara keseluruhan, barang-barang ini membuat masa inap saya sangat tidak memuaskan dengan deposit pertama saya yang tidak dilepaskan setelah saya membayar biaya yang disebutkan di atas. Sofitel memiliki 9 juta Rupee yang belum masuk ke rekening bank saya hingga hari ini, 24/08/2022 pukul 15.00. Saya telah menghubungi bank saya sore ini untuk melanjutkan proses ini. Mereka menjelaskan bahwa jumlah tersebut belum dicairkan oleh Sofitel, dan jika Sofitel memberi tahu bank saya, dana tersebut akan segera dicairkan. DANA TERSEBUT TETAP BELUM DICAIRKAN DAN DITAHAN OLEH SOFITEL. Akibatnya, liburan kami hancur dan saya tidak akan pernah merekomendasikan Sofitel lagi."

Ratusan orang mengantre panjang begitu dekat satu sama lain untuk sepotong pizza atau pasta dingin. Memalukan. Ini tidak dapat diterima di semua tingkatan. Sama dengan sarapan. Kami tidur dengan perut kosong selama 2 malam berturut-turut! Ini karena kami tidak dapat memesan makanan dari tempat lain karena Nyepi. Di pagi hari kami pergi ke pantai dan menemukan air dengan banyak plastik di dalamnya. Banyak sekali! Dan tidak ada personel hotel yang membersihkannya. Butuh waktu dua jam dan 4 tas besar untuk membersihkan sebagiannya. Tetapi sampah datang dalam jumlah besar. Staf hanya sibuk memasang tempat tidur berjemur. Benarkah? Bagaimana dengan membersihkan air dan pantai terlebih dahulu? Harap hindari hotel yang tidak menjaga lingkungan!"

Expedia juga menghubungi mereka beberapa kali untuk mencoba memperbaikinya atau mengembalikan uang pemesanan saya agar saya dapat memesan lagi di lain waktu. Sofitel telah menghubungi saya untuk mengatakan bahwa layanannya tidak dapat dikembalikan dan mereka akan menyimpan uangnya... Sangat buruk dan tidak profesional dari hotel sebesar ini. Saya tidak akan pernah kembali lagi dan akan memberi tahu semua teman dan keluarga untuk tidak repot-repot menginap di hotel ini.

"650.","Aileen Bak","6","2023-01-21","1","Mengerikan. Kalau saja saya bisa mencegah siapa pun menginap di sini, itu akan luar biasa. Sejujurnya, kamar dan fasilitasnya indah. TAPI. Restoran Cucina membahayakan kesehatan saya ketika saya makan di sana. Saat ini saya sedang hamil 5 bulan dan meskipun sudah memberi tahu staf Cucina bahwa saya hamil (mereka dengan baik hati membuatkan ulang pasta makanan laut saya ketika saya khawatir dengan juru masaknya. Meskipun saya tidak mengerti mengapa mereka memasak pasta terlalu lama), seorang pelayan mengantarkan minuman gratis ke meja saya dan tidak memberi tahu saya bahwa minuman itu mengandung alkohol. Saya minum sedikit dan baru menyadari bahwa minuman itu mengandung alkohol ketika seorang supervisor datang untuk memeriksa kami dan terkesiap melihat minuman di atas meja. Tentu saja saya sangat marah dan khawatir. Ketika saya mengeluh kepada seorang wanita Italia, yang saya duga adalah manajer restoran, dia berkata, Saya tidak bisa berkata apa-apa sekarang. Mereka memang meminta maaf, tapi apa gunanya? Restoran ternama macam apa yang memberi pelanggan makanan/minuman tanpa memberi tahu mereka apa yang mereka konsumsi?! Cucina tidak menawarkan layanan pemulihan apa pun. Jadi saya harus kembali ke kamar dan memuntahkan makan malam saya untuk menghilangkan alkohol sebisa mungkin. Saat saya muntah, suami saya pergi untuk berbicara dengan manajer jaga dan dia mengizinkan kami check out terlambat sebagai kompensasi. Bayangkan betapa terkejutnya saya melihat keberanian Cucina menagih kami seluruh makanan yang karena kelalaian mereka, berakhir di toilet. Saya pikir tindakan yang tepat adalah membebaskan biaya untuk makanan yang membahayakan keselamatan saya dan anak saya yang belum lahir. Tapi saya rasa di Sofitel Nusa Dua, standar mereka tentang apa yang dapat diterima, kebijakan restoran, dan pelatihan staf sangat berbeda dari apa yang dianggap dapat ditoleransi di tempat ternama mana pun di dunia. Saya dari Singapura dan bahkan warung kaki lima akan mengembalikan uang Anda jika makanan/minuman mereka membuat Anda bermasalah. Tapi tidak, Cucina di Sofitel Nusa Dua bahkan tidak bisa melakukan itu. Pengalaman yang buruk. Sofitel Nusa Dua merusak liburan pasangan terakhir saya dan mengkhianati kepercayaan saya."

Ketika saya check-in hampir pukul 9 pagi hari itu, saya bertanya apakah ada staf berbahasa Mandarin. Pihak hotel memberi tahu saya bahwa ada staf yang berbahasa Mandarin dari pukul 7 pagi hingga 4 pagi keesokan harinya. Karena saya sedang bepergian keesokan harinya dan tiba di hotel larut malam, saya tidak bertanya apakah staf berbahasa Mandarin masih ada. Saya menelepon pukul 9 pagi ini untuk menanyakan tentang staf berbahasa Mandarin, dan mereka mengatakan tidak ada hari ini. Saya tidak tahu apakah ada staf seperti itu. Ketika saya check-in, saya harus bertanya apakah ada jadwal hotel sebelum mereka memberikannya kepada saya. Staf layanan mengatakan bahwa pihak hotel akan menjelaskan berbagai layanan hotel. Namun, mereka tidak memberi tahu saya bahwa saya boleh mengambil foto hari itu dan hanya mengabaikannya. Mereka mungkin mengira saya tidak mengerti dan tidak menggunakan penerjemah untuk berkomunikasi dengan saya. Rasanya sangat buruk. Beberapa malam yang lalu, saya menginap di Hotel Four Seasons, dan meskipun mereka bilang staf Tiongkok tidak ada di sana, mereka tetap menghubungi staf Tiongkok untuk berkomunikasi dengan saya.

Kami mengirimkan surat rumah sakit, tetapi kedua permintaan kami ditolak dan hanya dikirimi email penolakan standar. Layanannya sangat buruk.

Sofitel sudah mendatangi pengacara mereka dan mengancam saya karena menulis di Trip Advisor tentang pengalaman saya. Saya merasa lucu karena saya mengatakan yang sebenarnya, dan sepertinya Sofitel lebih tertarik merahasiakannya karena mereka tahu betapa memalukannya memperlakukan tamu seperti ini.

Mereka menandai Pemesanan saya sebagai dibatalkan dan memberi tahu bahwa itu adalah pemesanan yang tidak dapat dikembalikan. Berdasarkan Hukum Internasional dan Klausul 'Force Majeure', saya berhak atas pengembalian dana penuh, termasuk $60 yang mereka tagihkan kepada saya untuk mengkonversi dari AUD ke mata uang mereka. Saya membayar AUD $2.074. Ini sangat mengecewakan dari Hotel ini yang serakah dan tampaknya menjadi hukum bagi diri mereka sendiri. Tindakan ini sama saja dengan pencurian."

Mereka berjongkok di kursi pantai meskipun barang-barang kami ada di atasnya. Dan mereka meninggalkan pantai dalam kondisi yang menyedihkan (kaleng, sampah, kantong plastik).

In this Era, gojek atau grab food itu hal yang tidak bisa dihindari, kebijakan kalian dalam meng handle penerimaan makanan2 customer sangat buruk, hanya alasan tidak ada meja yang proper dan bisa menganggu food safety customer, masa di tahun 2025 masalah meja saja, masa hotel luxury bintang 5 tidak bisa beli meja? teknologi food delivery seperti itu sepertinya sudah berlangsung 5 sampe 6 tahun kebelakangan di Indonesia, masa kebijakan nya masih seperti itu? Selama trip kemarin saya ke bali, saya nginap di 2 hotel 5 star luxury berbeda, yaitu The mer* Sanur dan Padm* Ubud, boleh lah kalian belajar sama Mer* Sanur, kebijakan penerimaan makanan nya yang sangat customer friendly, oh iya saya juga sangat miris terhadap kebijakan solusi yang kalian berikan, contoh lah padm* ubud saya komplain terkait makanan mereka langsung saya diberikan complimentary lain. Sedangkan penangan customer komplain kalian apa? saya cuman di telepon oleh duty manager kalian dan bilang mohon maaf, that's all? sungguh sangat buruk manajemen hotel sofitel ini. Dengan sudah 2 kali pengalaman buruk di tahun ini di hotel2 accor, saya jadi berpikir untuk kedepan nya apakah saya apakah akan tetap menginap di hotel jaringan accor yang padahal saya ada member PLATINUM di jaringan Accor? atau mungkin saya akan pindah ke marriott atau hilton atau hyatt"

Jaoh2 hotel 600rb masih bisa menyediakan pilihan yg lebih mahal. Variant breakfast buffetnya banyak dan recommended.. sayangnya utk ala carte resto italianya sedang renov tutup. Cuman buka malam hari dgn dining area outdoor. Trus sering ada tamu negara katanya. Dan kebetulan pas hari itu ada tamu tertinggi negara dtg bermain ke sofitel beserta rombongan keluarganya. Hasilnya 1/4 pantai ditutup aksesnya..banyak protokoler lalu lalang di daerah pantai bikin tidak nyaman bersantai lama2 di pantai. Beberapa fasilitas seperti archery jg ga bisa dipakai pada saat itu. Pilihan makanan ala carte sangat terbatas dan tidak menarik utk hotel sekelasnya. Untung ketolong beach club manarai.. lokasi kurang strategis.. apalagi skrg kondisi nusa dua belum bangkit kembali. Jadi bisa dbilang ga ada kegiatan apa2 malam hari di nusa dua. Ke daerah hotspot malam hari seperti jimbaran aga jaoh. Tidak ada benefit apa2 ya utk basic member accor disini.

"736.","dew k","1","2026-01-07","2","Pengalaman saya menginap di Sofitel Nusa Dua Resort, sayangnya, adalah yang paling mengecewakan di antara semua pengalaman Accor saya. Meskipun saya anggota Platinum dan Accor Plus, saya merasa bahwa kedua status tersebut tidak memberikan manfaat atau pengakuan nyata selama saya menginap. Layanan kebersihan jauh dari memuaskan — handuk, air minum kemasan, dan perlengkapan teh atau kopi seringkali tidak diisi ulang, yang memaksa saya untuk berulang kali meminta atau menyerah karena terasa terlalu merepotkan. Meskipun saya dapat memahami kurangnya peningkatan kamar karena tingkat hunian yang tinggi, saya kecewa menerima email promosi beberapa hari sebelum menginap yang menawarkan peningkatan kamar berbayar. Ini memberi saya kesan bahwa Sofitel Nusa Dua Resort memprioritaskan penjualan peningkatan kamar daripada mengakui dan menghargai anggota Platinum yang loyal. Tingkat layanan dan suasana keseluruhan resor tidak terasa seperti properti mewah sejati. Kualitas sarapan sangat mengecewakan, dan saya akan mengatakan bahwa kualitasnya bahkan di bawah standar sarapan Novotel. Variasi dan kesegaran makanan sangat mengecewakan, dan banyak item yang kurang rasa dan menarik. Anggur yang disajikan di resor juga merupakan poin negatif lainnya. Saya memesan segelas Sauvignon Blanc yang rasanya sangat teroksidasi dan hambar sehingga saya hampir tidak bisa mengenalinya. Rasanya seperti botol itu sudah dibuka hampir dua minggu, yang sama sekali tidak dapat diterima. Club Millésime biasa saja dan jelas kekurangan staf. Pada dua kesempatan, keluarga saya duduk di meja selama lebih dari 30 menit tanpa ada yang menanyakan pesanan kami. Masih banyak lagi yang bisa saya katakan, tetapi jujur ​​saja, saya tidak ingin lagi menghabiskan waktu saya untuk menceritakan semua kekecewaan ini. Pengalaman ini membuat saya sangat kecewa dan mempertanyakan apakah Sofitel Nusa Dua benar-benar menghargai anggota setianya."
"737.","Thu Yain","81","2025-12-24","2","Saya tidak mengerti ulasan-ulasan bagusnya. Ya, pelayanannya secara sepintas memang bagus. Tapi, selain itu, biasa saja. Meskipun staf klub tampaknya sedikit lebih ramah dan luar biasa. Fasilitas selamat datang hanyalah sekeranjang buah. Meminta perpanjangan waktu check-out dan tanggapannya sangat buruk. Selain itu, kamar-kamarnya sudah tua. Pagar berkarat. Kami berjalan di sepanjang pantai dan dapat melihat kolam renang hotel lain tampak lebih baik dan lebih bersih. Nusa Dua jauh dari banyak tempat, jadi pastikan untuk menyewa sopir atau mobil."
"738.","Priscilla Chrisanita","8","2025-11-21","2","Sejujurnya, meskipun hotel ini bintang lima, sayangnya pelayanannya seperti hotel bintang tiga. Tidak seperti hotel bintang lima lainnya di Bali seperti Kempinski, Hotel Ritz Carlton, Hyatt Regency, atau Andaz, Anda bisa menemukan pengalaman mewah yang sesungguhnya dengan harga yang sama dengan Sofitel. Di Sofitel, banyak kolam renang berwarna hijau seperti lumpur karena perawatannya yang buruk. Dan untuk semua aktivitas seperti bersepeda dan klub anak-anak, Anda harus membayar ekstra. Pilihan sarapannya sangat buruk. Di klub anak-anak, sebenarnya ada lebih dari 8 staf yang bertugas, tetapi Anda tetap tidak boleh meninggalkan anak-anak di klub anak-anak kecuali membayar layanan tambahan. Jadi, saya akhirnya menemani anak-anak dan menceritakan kepada staf di klub anak-anak bahwa mereka sedang bergosip karena mereka tidak ada kegiatan! Sebagai anggota Accor, saya sendiri adalah anggota Gold dan suami saya adalah anggota Platinum, Anda tidak akan mendapatkan peningkatan apa pun! Meskipun dalam benefit Anda disebutkan bahwa Anda akan mendapatkan kamar terbaik yang tersedia, mereka justru memberikan Anda kamar yang menghadap ke tempat parkir! Jadi, jika Anda mengharapkan layanan mewah, pertimbangkan baik-baik untuk pergi ke Sofitel. Saya jamin merek mewah lain akan memberikan layanan yang lebih baik! Di sini seperti Anda terbang dengan maskapai berbiaya rendah di mana Anda harus membayar ekstra untuk apa pun."

Sayangnya, kami sangat kecewa dengan hotel ini. Hotelnya sangat kuno, kamarnya bagus tapi biasa saja, akses ke lautnya buruk, dan kami berharap lautnya bagus untuk berenang, yang sayangnya tidak terjadi di sini. Airnya sangat keruh, banyak kapal kargo yang lalu lalang, banyak karang, dan ombak yang kuat membuat lautnya tidak terpakai dan hanya menjadi pemandangan yang indah. Stafnya sangat perhatian, tetapi itu sama sekali tidak membenarkan harga yang sangat mahal di sini. Semua makanannya setidaknya dua kali lipat lebih mahal daripada di semua hotel lain tempat kami menginap, yang berarti kami makan di luar setiap malam. Kami tidak merekomendasikannya."

Karena kesalahan agen, hal ini tidak diatur. Setelah diberitahu, kami segera mencoba menyesuaikan pemesanan agar anak-anak kami dapat tinggal bersama kami. Meskipun demikian, saat check-in hotel memberikan anak-anak kami kamar terpisah di lantai yang berbeda, yang secara efektif mengharuskan orang tua dan anak-anak di bawah umur untuk tinggal terpisah. Kami dengan jelas menyatakan bahwa ini tidak dapat diterima dari perspektif keselamatan anak dan tanggung jawab. Manajer Bertugas menolak untuk bertanggung jawab, menyatakan bahwa itu adalah masalah agen dan tim reservasi, dan hanya menawarkan penurunan kelas kamar, meskipun kesalahan bukan dari pihak kami. Tidak ada upaya berarti yang dilakukan untuk menjaga agar orang tua dan anak-anak tetap bersama — bahkan pada Malam Tahun Baru. Sebagai anggota Accor Corp Plus, kami mengharapkan kesejahteraan tamu dan keselamatan keluarga menjadi prioritas. Pengalaman ini telah sangat merusak kepercayaan kami pada merek Sofitel, dan kami tidak akan kembali."

Bahkan setelah saya memperingatkan mereka tentang warnanya, mereka tidak mengambil tindakan. Bintang lima bukan untuk makanannya.... Saya sangat kecewa dengan pengalaman menginap ini. Club millésime sangat bagus dan ramah serta profesional. Jangan pergi ke Sofitel. Anda membayar terlalu mahal untuk kenyamanan dan kesenangan yang kurang."

Sarapan mengecewakan: kurang berkelas, disajikan tanpa perhatian, dan ruang sarapan terasa terlalu panas.

Bahkan di area umum hotel, Anda dapat melihat banyak hal yang tidak terawat atau tidak terawat dengan baik seperti batu bata yang lepas, finishing yang buruk, dan kerusakan umum."

"747.","Taylor Pullen","140","2025-01-21","2","Kami telah menginap di Sofitel Nusa Dua lima kali sejak 2018, dan meskipun awalnya kami menyukai resor ini, standar layanannya terus menurun setiap kali kami menginap. Sayangnya, kunjungan terakhir ini kemungkinan akan menjadi kunjungan terakhir kami. Kamar-kamarnya tetap dirancang dengan indah dan nyaman, menampilkan kemewahan yang Anda harapkan dari sebuah properti Sofitel. Namun, beberapa kesalahan kecil namun berdampak, seperti kursi yang hilang di meja makan kami, membuat kegiatan sederhana seperti makan bersama pasangan terasa canggung. Kami menyadari bahwa sekarang tidak ada lagi camilan yang tersedia di bak mandi mini dan pilihan minuman telah dikurangi. Kami juga mengalami masalah dengan air panas dan kunci di pintu belakang kamar dengan kolam renang kecil kami rusak sehingga siapa pun bisa masuk ke kamar kami. Namun, masalah yang paling terasa adalah layanan makanan dan minuman. Terlihat jelas bahwa sebagian besar staf adalah pekerja harian, dan sayangnya, hal ini menyebabkan kurangnya pengaturan. Saat makan siang Natal, misalnya, kami menunggu 45 menit untuk minum, dan 30 menit untuk kopi keesokan paginya saat sarapan. Pelayanan di meja terasa terburu-buru dan hambar—sangat berbeda dengan yang Anda harapkan dari resor bintang 5. Sedih juga melihat piring-piring pecah dan retak di prasmanan. Sofitel Nusa Dua masih memiliki banyak potensi, tetapi standar layanan dan perhatian terhadap detail perlu ditingkatkan secara signifikan agar layak disebut resor bintang 5. Untuk saat ini, kami akan mencari tempat lain untuk liburan berikutnya."
"748.","MickMcM","7","2025-05-21","2","Kamar kami belum siap saat tiba, kami diberitahu untuk pergi ke bar dan menunggu (kami memiliki 3 anak di bawah 8 tahun), akhirnya kami dikirimi pesan bahwa kamar kami sudah siap, yang mana 2 jam kemudian. Begitu kami tiba kembali di resepsionis, staf meminta kami untuk duduk dan menunggu karena mereka sedang sibuk. Setelah beberapa saat, kami mendekati meja kosong di mana wanita itu menjelaskan bahwa dia sedang sibuk, pada dasarnya kami menyuruhnya untuk membereskannya, yang dia lakukan (butuh waktu kurang dari 2 menit). Kamarnya sangat mendasar. Ini adalah tempat pertama di Bali yang tidak terasa seperti Bali. Staf sangat kasar di resepsionis dan di kafe tepi kolam renang. Kedua meja tempat mereka duduk kami memiliki meja yang belum dibersihkan dan kursinya rusak."
"749.","S Heslop","9","2025-09-21","2","Sayangnya makanan yang disajikan tidak memenuhi standar hotel bintang lima, cukup mengecewakan. Stafnya luar biasa. Lokasinya di pantai sangat menakjubkan, hanya saja makanannya perlu diperbaiki."
"750.","Ruchita Agarwal","8","2025-03-21","2","Kami memilih menginap di Sofitel Nusa Dua untuk bulan madu kami. Propertinya sangat bagus. Namun, pengalaman saya kurang memuaskan. Saya memesan paket kamar dan spa karena ingin bersantai di hari terakhir bulan madu kami. Di hotel, mereka bilang hanya bisa menawarkan pijat di pantai, bukan di pusat 'So Spa' mereka. Saya akan dikenakan biaya tambahan untuk suasana pusat spa untuk pijat yang sama. Hal ini tidak dijelaskan secara detail saat pemesanan (tangkapan layar terlampir). Cuacanya terlalu panas dan lembap untuk menikmati pijat di pantai terbuka. Saya merasa kurang nyaman. Spa adalah tentang pengalaman, dan bagi saya, pengalaman itu hancur. Saya terpaksa menikmati pijat di tempat tidur kamar hotel (bahkan tempat tidur pijat pun tidak disediakan). Tempat tidurnya terlalu empuk saat pijat, dan saya kesulitan bernapas selama pijat karena leher saya tidak bisa bersandar dengan benar di tempat tidur kamar hotel. Ini bukan pengalaman yang saya harapkan dari hotel bintang lima. Sangat mengecewakan."
"751.","Aditi Nanavaty","77","2025-06-21","2","Proses check in sangat lambat meskipun kami sudah melakukan check in online juga. Dia terus mengulang hal yang sama dan merupakan orang yang paling lambat melakukan check in secara langsung. Kami mendapat peningkatan kamar tetapi ada masalah pemeliharaan di kamar - telepon tidak berfungsi, gelas hilang dan kemudian pada malam hari ada kecoak berjalan di tempat tidur. Untungnya kami hanya menginap semalam karena kami harus berangkat pagi-pagi sekali! Ada banyak hotel di Bali yang bisa Anda pilih untuk menghabiskan uang. Pengalaman yang buruk."
"752.","Mohammed Nasr","10","2025-06-21","2","Saya mengalami pengalaman yang sangat mengecewakan di Sofitel Nusa Dua, yang akhirnya membuat saya memutuskan untuk keluar sebelum masa menginap saya berakhir. Properti ini terasa ketinggalan zaman dan perlu banyak perbaikan — tentu saja tidak memenuhi harapan resor bintang 5. Hampir setiap fasilitas dikenakan biaya tambahan, yang tidak dikomunikasikan dengan jelas di awal. Selain itu, semua harga dicantumkan sebelum pajak, sehingga biaya yang dikeluarkan terasa menyesatkan. Untuk resor dengan nama Sofitel, saya mengharapkan standar kualitas, layanan, dan transparansi yang jauh lebih tinggi."
"753.","Steven","17","2025-05-21","2","Pengalaman menginap kami mengecewakan karena pelayanan yang tidak ramah, komunikasi yang buruk, dan kurangnya nilai untuk uang. Proses check-in terasa dingin, dan alih-alih perkenalan, kami justru didekati oleh seorang fotografer yang menawarkan jasa pemotretan. Kejutan yang direncanakan pun terlaksana sehari lebih awal, meskipun pihak hotel kemudian meminta maaf dan mengundang kami makan malam. Kamar pemandangan laut kami hanya memiliki pemandangan pohon palem, dan sarapan seharga 25€ yang terlalu mahal itu gelap, berisik, dan tempat duduknya acak. Secara keseluruhan, dibandingkan dengan hotel lain yang pernah kami inapi, pengalaman menginap di hotel ini tidak sepadan dengan harganya, dan kami tidak akan kembali."
"754.","Renato Trentin","43","2025-06-21","2","Saya kecewa dengan masa inap saya. Hotel ini layaknya hotel bintang 5, tetapi layanan dan makanannya kurang. Minumannya juga sangat mahal. Hotel ini tidak memenuhi standar resor hotel lain di Nusa Dua. Sebaiknya cari tempat menginap lain."
