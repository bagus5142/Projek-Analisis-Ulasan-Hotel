"1.","Nash Md","29","2025-12-18","5","Our 5 days and 4 nights stay at The Westin Nirup Island was truly exceptional. From arrival to departure, the experience reflected thoughtful luxury, impeccable service, and genuine hospitality. The service was outstanding. Warm, attentive, and highly professional. The food was consistently excellent, and the breakfast spread was premium in both quality and variety. A very special and heartfelt mention goes to Nono, who welcomed us from the ferry terminal and took exceptional care of our family throughout the stay. His warmth and sincerity made a lasting impression, and our children became especially attached to him. We would also like to sincerely thank the wonderful teams who made our stay seamless. Food and Beverage Team Akif, Cindi, Evi, Putri, and Sela Front Desk Team Batara, Rara, Faroq, Shafa, and Satria Wellness Team Tree, Gaga, and Raja, who supported and engaged our children with activities throughout the stay Bell Boy Team Rezy, Anang, and Yoga, who safely transported us via buggy around the island Management Team Hazel, Daisy, and Omen, whose leadership is clearly reflected in the consistent five star service across the resort Our room was clean, cozy, and beautifully designed, with a calming sea facing view that made every morning peaceful and refreshing. The island’s exclusivity, combined with well curated activities, meant we never felt bored. The direct ferry from HarbourFront made travel smooth and efficient. This stay was absolutely worth the price. Our entire family left feeling happy, relaxed, and grateful. We will definitely return."

"3.","Zee Wong","47","2025-12-11","4","We stayed 2 nights on the package which included 3 meals. Overall we had a good relaxing time with highlights being the great weather (we were lucky), beautiful serene waters and view, the public pool (it was never too crowded when we went in afternoon), the warm smiles and kindness of the staff, the lovely Heavenly bed and finally, the wonderful spa massage. I hope Westin Nirup will work on improving these points to ensure returning guests: 1. Better service workflows. At breakfast, when guests are brought to the table, we were not asked for our drinks order. So we would have to get attention of staff just to order our drinks, which arrived as we were nearly done with our food. For lunch and dinner, upon getting seated, sometimes our waters were not filled, crackers not given to our table only, cutlery was missing etc. We often had to work to get staff’s attention in a not-crowded restaurant. Tightening these service gaps will allow guests to truly relax and feel cared for. 2. Food and drinks taste. I think most Singaporean guests count on having a stellar nasi goreng and mee goreng - there’s still some ways to go, and I hope you will get there! We ordered a milkshake and a coconut lime cooler and neither were good; after that, we stuck to canned drinks only. Since you earn on drinks, this is a missed opportunity for the business! 3. Island hopping activities - would love some eco tours or visiting neighbouring islands, if at all possible. 4. Pillows were too soft 🙃 Thank you to all the staff at Westin Nirup - keep going and keep improving!"
"4.","Elvin Too","26","2025-12-01","5","Just stated two nights at this lovely new hotel. Service was fantastic in all aspects. The birthday setup in the room was the best I’ve ever seen, and each day there was a personalised card signed by various staff members wishing us well. The views from the room, lobby, pool, restaurant was expansive - felt like a world away even though we were just an hour by direct ferry from Singapore. Seafood was fresh and delicious, though pricey. There are also economical options that won’t break the bank (fried rice, fried noodles) for budget conscious travellers. I anticipate prices will go up significantly once the hotel fully opens, direct ferry frequency increases, and the hotel gets on the radar of Singapore residents looking for a quick getaway."
"5.","Melissa","259","2025-12-01","1","The island, the gym and the staff are great. BUT this is at best A Holiday inn experience at westin $300 prices. the prices clearly target Singaporeans who want a quick getaway, but u may get a better bang buck in Bintan. Constellate Pool was so small, guests were competing for sun chairs. Ordered alcohol but our orders were often forgotten or took too long to come (because they had one guy serving and pouring the drinks, poor guy)… Hardcore Music suddenly blaring haphazardly at Sunday 10am At the pool while everyone is relaxing… some guests just left, and forced participation for aqua aerobics in the already small pool…. See video. The hotel is clearly still having teething issues. Some food was good (at Salt, and constellate burgers) but others were bad…. With limited selection…they may need to think more deeply about crowd control in various areas. We also got reminders to pay early right after breakfast because of the crowd…Which rlly doesn’t feel like a relaxing hotel experience, but like we are cows being herded in a farm 🤣 Maybe I expected too much out of a westin."
"6.","Dona Toh","32","2025-12-01","5","Lovely weekend getaway, especially now that there’s daily ferry direct to Nirup island. Hotel wise - nice, clean rooms with strong water pressure and hot water (always a plus in these island resort) and of course, as mentioned many a times, very attentive staff! Shout out to Aqim (server in Island Kitchen) and FOH concierge for their kindness to us. Will definitely come back again. Probably just a small feedback: it’ll be great to have a room service menu in our room.. it’ll make ordering room service so much easier although I don’t mind having all my meals at Westin’s restaurants too"
"7.","Mathieu Sneep","133","2025-10-01","5","Amazing stay at The Westin Nirup Island! 🌴 This hotel is all about wellness and tranquility. The staff are incredibly hospitable and make you feel right at home. Facilities are top-notch: a beautiful pool, relaxing sauna, a small beach with its own pool and beach bar, a well-equipped gym with daily classes, and excellent massages. During my stay, some parts of the resort and nearby villas were still being finalized, but the team handled it very well and quickly moved me to a quieter room. It’s clear they’re putting the finishing touches on what’s already a fantastic resort, and it will only get better. If you’re looking for a place that blends luxury, privacy, and convenience, just a short boat ride from Singapore, this is a great option. Watching the Singapore skyline shimmer on the horizon makes it even more special. Highly recommended!"
"8.","Moretti","8","2025-12-01","1","Where to begin. First of all, this is not a complaint about the service effort. It was good and can clearly tell they tried their best. The gym is also a clear 5/5....its hard to find a proper squat rack in a gym. The rooms are also very nice. Onto the feedback - firstly this is definitely not the same standard as other Westins globally, despite charging SG prices. It was probably the worst Westin when you comp it to Westins in just about every other city in Asia. Hence the 1 star. So here are a few points...a non exhaustive list. 1. Food is really not good. And because it is a captive market and no option to Grab, it was all we got. This was probably a 2/5 for me. 2. There are probably 100 units and the rooftop pool only has 15ish beach chairs? Pool size is basically no different than a small apartment pool. Clearly not thought through and sure enough, on Saturday, when the resort is not even at full capacity, there were guests queing for a beach chair. What about Salt Beach club? Sure...its an option, but (i) the view is inexistent and (ii) beach feels as uncombed as Palawan beach at Sentosa. 3. Why does it take forever to get a drink here? Ordered espresso + latte at breakfast and it took 15 minutes (finished food already). Ordered beer twice at the pool and it never came (but they did bill me for the beer). Ordered a wine bottle for dinner and it took also 20 minutes (was already done eating first course). Ordered beer at the restaurant as we were waiting to depart after checking out and it also took 20 minutes. Seriously is the fridge at the other side of the resort? 4. As I said above - service staff was trying their best and are very friendly, but they weren't trained very well. Also, receiving a letter to advise me to check out right after breakfast to beat the checkout rush is really what I expected from a hostel and not a Westin. 5. Saves the best for last. Please do not do your electro dance themed Water Aerobics workout in the morning at your main pool. It was loud, annoying, and was enforced second hand participation for everyone else at the pool. Plus, dont forget we only have 4 to 5 other attractions here, so it isnt like as if we can escape elsewhere"
"9.","Steven Famy","28","2025-12-01","5","The Westin Nirup Island is a beautiful, quiet, and modern destination, with a touch of high-tech convenience that makes everything feel fresh and well-designed. The island offers stunning ocean views and a peaceful atmosphere, now made even more accessible with a direct ferry from Singapore, making the trip quick and effortless. The hotel is new, clean, and thoughtfully built, giving a premium impression from the moment you arrive. A great place to visit if you appreciate beautiful scenery, tranquility, and a modern resort experience. Highly recommended!"
"10.","Joanne S","49","2025-12-01","5","We enjoyed every bit of our stay at Westin Nirup. Great serendipity for a weekend retreat from the hassle and bustle of Singapore. Only cons is the long check in line on a Saturday. Apart from that, service is awesome and breakfast spread is great with lots of variety. Sea sport activities is still limited with not much motorised activities. Love the infinity pool and spa. Recommended for couples or families to enjoy an escapade from the city."
"11.","cherie collins","40","2025-12-01","3","The service, food, and room were very good. Also, the gym is well equipped. However, the resort had some downsides. - Construction. There is quite a bit still ongoing and some lasted past 9pm. No suites were completed; only standard rooms. - Lack of elevators. Hope you like stairs and ramps. - Check in/out. This is a very clunky process. Because of the ferry arrivals and departures, large numbers of guests are coming and going at the same time. Hotel needs to figure this out before they get any busier. - Lack of a small shop for essentials and trinkets. Due to being trapped on the island, this would be a great add. Most resorts have a place to grab a snack or soda or souvenir. - Water activities advertised by hotel require cash payment and cannot be charged to your room. - Getting to and from the island by ferry and through immigration and customs is slow. The island seems lovely. And the staff are attentive and kind. But the negatives knock off a couple of stars for me."
"12.","Roland Yeo","8","2025-12-11","4","Our family of 4 booked into Westin last weekend for a short holiday. The newly opened hotel still have additional facilities under construction. What they lack in terms of facilities like children playground, small retail shops and more dining options, the entire team from reception to restaurant and housekeeping really more than make up for the shortfall. Their enthusiasm, commitment to ensure all guests enjoyed their stay there speaks volumes. Thank you."
"13.","Amanda","44","2025-10-01","5","This hotel is a really nice choice for a family getaway. There are lots of fun water activities like banana boat rides, paddle boarding, and kayaking. The price is definitely worth it considering the private island experience. That said, a few things could be improved. The shuttle boat to the island is too small, and the staff seemed a bit unorganized during the loading process. Also, there’s no proper waiting area for guests while waiting for the boat. And for the sea itself, don’t expect crystal-clear blue water it’s more greenish, so not the best. Overall, still a good experience and worth visiting for the island and activities."
"14.","Taiji Master","235","2025-12-01","3","⭐ 3.5 / 5 Beautiful island, great people — but still half-baked. After a 2D1N (almost 2 nights) stay, here are my honest thoughts on this new property: People & Service The people here are 101% friendly — genuine smiles everywhere. Service-wise, about 90% of them know what they are doing, so “software-wise”, no issue at all. Pre-Arrival & Transfer The pre-arrival email was rather plain, not quite at Westin’s usual standard. Pickup at Harbour Bay was fine — staff were polite and attentive, but the boat ride was rocky. The welcome session on Nirup Island felt average, and it would have been nice if Titanium or Platinum elites were recognised or prioritised — there were fewer than 30 guests anyway. Check-In & Room Check-in was slow and a little messy, though I could tell they were trying hard. The escort to the room was excellent — a genuine 5-star touch. The room itself was decent, with thoughtful details like motion-sensing light switches and soft-close sliding doors. But entertainment-wise, the experience fell short: limited TV channels, casting didn’t work, and the Netflix/YouTube apps were useless since you can’t log in. HDMI supposedly supported — but no port or cable in sight. Food & Beverage This area needs the most improvement. There’s only one all-day dining restaurant with a limited menu. Breakfast uses the same à la carte menu as regular dining, so the variety feels minimal. No egg station, few sides for omelettes, and even simple over-easy eggs didn’t come out right. The second restaurant, Salt Seafood, serves much better food, though it only opens Fri–Sun and many dishes were sold out. The bright side — Sindi and April from Salt were fantastic: friendly, knowledgeable, and genuinely customer-focused. Alcohol is 5× more expensive than Singapore, so water might be the wisest choice. The poolside outlet, Constellate, feels more like a tent setup than a full restaurant. When you see the menu and presentation, you might lose your appetite a little — at least I did. Spa The spa front-desk staff were friendly and welcoming, while the masseur was excellent — attentive, skilled, and communicated well in English. Unfortunately, the facilities did not match their standard: a clogged shower, and a dirty sauna with white powder residue on the wooden floor — likely from the hot stones when guests splash water. It should really be cleaned daily. On the bright side, their ginger tea was superb. Overall This place has great potential. The team’s heart is in the right place, but the property still feels half-cooked. With better food, more polished operations, and proper maintenance, it could become a true island paradise. And with another 2 days and 1 night to go, I am honestly not sure how I will survive without decent food… good thing I packed two cup noodles — probably my best meal plan here. 🍜😅 If they really make it, this can be a paradise. Maybe they should hire me to fine-tune their SOPs and quality — I might just help them get there faster. 😉 Since this shares the same owner as Marriott Batam, where they truly did a superb job, you might want to pop over there instead — at least until this one finds its rhythm. 🌴"
"15.","Megan Chai","18","2025-08-01","5","My recent stay at The Westin Nirup Island Resort & Spa was truly outstanding. The hotel is beautifully designed, extremely clean, and feels brand new—the attention to detail can be seen in every corner. The rooms are spacious, modern, and very comfortable, with large smart TVs, balconies or patios, and luxurious amenities like bathrobes and separate sitting areas. Service throughout the property was prompt and attentive, with staff always ready to help. The breakfast selection exceeded expectations, offering everything from a live grill station and noodle counter to delicious cakes and roasted duck. Even during busy periods, staff were proactive in finding seats and making guests feel welcome. The resort’s facilities are impressive: there are two outdoor pools, a full-service spa, a well-equipped gym, and a kids’ club, making it ideal for both families and couples. Activities like canoeing, paddleboarding, and access to the private marina add great value for those looking for adventure and relaxation. Overall, The Westin Nirup Island is a perfect island getaway with a blend of luxury, comfort, and thoughtful hospitality—a wonderful place to unwind and enjoy the natural beauty of Nirup Island."
"16.","Filip Aniés","37","2025-12-01","5","Perfect for anyone looking for a relaxing get-away. The staff are so kind and hospitable. Food is great. The island is the resort, and vice versa. Had my best night's sleep in a long time."
"17.","Sharon C","13","2025-09-01","5","While getting there was a bit challenging (the location isn’t the most accessible, with 2 step ferry trip), the staff were incredibly attentive they knew exactly when we arrived and immediately assisted us. Very seamless arrival despite remote location The resort is clearly still developing, and while kids' activities were somewhat limited, they did have a few activities, similar to other Marriott. First day it was quiet and uncrowded vibe. We did a mini bartender exercise that was a fun. Kiddo really enjoyed mixing his own mocktail, and it was a great start for day1. Total of 3 restaurants you can dine at. 2 in the boarding options. Half or full boarding options available. They made sure you are well hydrated within the resort. food was better than expected, well executed 👏 Another hiccup: the beach activity center only accepts cash (no room charging), which was inconvenient since we didn’t carry cash. They managed to give us enough information for wire. It’s odd that not everything is integrated into one billing system for private island.hopefully they streamline this soon. On the bright side, the massage services were excellent - one of the best parts of the stay Final Thoughts: ✔ Pros: tranquil ambience place, attentive staff, good massages, fun activity available for kids ✖ Cons: Limited kids activities, cash-only beach activities, still under construction in parts. Once fully completed, with more amenities and activities in place, it could be a fantastic getaway. For now, it’s a work in progress, but the hospitality makes up for the current limitations."
"18.","Camila Estrada","9","2025-09-01","5","We had the absolute best time here. It was a short ferry ride from Batam. And the amenities are absolutely amazing. The resort is beautiful. Yoga was our server and he was so kind and helpful. It’s a very easy trip from Singapore. We will definitely be back."
"19.","Nashlie Yao","9","2025-11-01","5","Amazing and beautiful getaway just 30 mins away from Singapore! Staff were extremely friendly and attentive. Highly recommend visiting their spa and gym! A must visit for a quick unforgettable island experience."
"20.","Prateek","8","2025-09-01","2","Just had a weekend trip to this property and genuinely writing this to help anyone planning to visit soon, since its a new property. Location: BEAUTIFUL island, butttttt getting here is like fighting a war. Boat from Harbour Bay is overloaded, suffocating and unsafe. In total from SG, the trip is about 6 hours due to weird boat timings to Nirup. Food: Have 3 restaurants, 2 are quite nice and chef is willing to go out of the way. The sunset bar, with western menu is crap! Service: Hotel is still under construction so anything you ask for is unavailable. SPA is full of inexperienced staff, and most things unavailable. Would i revisit? Only if they start a direct ferry from SG, and they are fully functional. Its currently cheating clients to come and waste time if you are not completely open! Many better Mariott options instead of choosing this."
"21.","Lim YH","35","2025-10-01","5","Impeccable service by the team! As the resort is fairly new, it’s calming and peaceful. Really like the presentation and taste of the food as well. Truly a place to be at if you want to take a break. Special shoutouts to all staff at the reception, Cindi and Adi from Island Kitchen and not to forget Resti the housekeeper."
"22.","Delicia Tan","33","2025-08-01","5","Westin Nirup offers what so few resorts manage—space, stillness, and discretion. For most of our stay, we were the only guests. The service was impeccable: Yoga, Chef Amin, and Adi at Island Kitchen were thoughtful, polished, and quietly attentive. The setting is pristine, the architecture restrained and tasteful. The spa, while competent, lacked the indulgence expected of the Westin brand. The journey—via a crowded two-step ferry and an unexpected island stop—was less elegant. But once you arrive, the noise fades. This is a place of potential. Best enjoyed before the world takes notice."
"23.","Man Kien","72","2025-09-01","5","New hotel, very nice building. Some part still under construction. Go there by ferry from harbour bay, 20 mins only. Staff very friendly and helpful. Using hotel buggy cart to travel within island. Foods was nice, environment is clean and nice too. Definitely go again."
"24.","Joe Chia","13","2025-12-01","1","the guest service is incredibly lousy. i booked for a higher room. the reception keep telling me there is no room in the higher floors without bothering to check. after my insistence, they found a room on the second floor. while this is happening, their staff made my wife and me walk to the lobby and back when we could have waited in the wrong room they placed initially!"
"25.","Anastasia Param","5","2025-08-01","5","CHILL GETAWAY WITH AMAZING SERVICE We recently stayed at The Westin Nirup Island and had a wonderful experience. Although the resort is still in its early stages with some areas under construction and a few facilities like the menu selection and water sports options still being finalized, the service was truly exceptional and made all the difference. A special shoutout to Chef Amin, Danang, Cindy, and especially Adi, who went above and beyond throughout our stay. Adi was incredible—almost like our personal butler—always one step ahead and making sure we were comfortable and well taken care of at every moment. Their genuine hospitality and attention to detail made us feel truly valued. Despite the minor inconveniences of a newly opened resort, the warmth and dedication of the team more than made up for it. We can already see the huge potential this property has once everything is fully up and running. We look forward to returning again in the future to enjoy the full experience!"

"28.","Lizzie Maxted","2","2025-01-01","3","We moored our boat in the Marina for 2 nites 6-8 June . Although the Marina is fully operational the “Westin Hotel resort” will be opened early 2025 . The Marina facilities however needs some “tweaking” 1. The ladies shower room has slated wooden panels that allows the public full view of the changing area - suggest a screen to be put across the wooden panel 2.The rain shower is great but shower area does not drain properly and hot water was available . 3. The club house seating - chairs around the dining area are too low making dining uncomfortable. 4. Laundry facilities was also not available. 5.Considering that we were the only visitors at the Marina - The restaurant offered a full menu & was delicious . The staff went out of their way with their friendliness & service - Kudos to the staff . 6. The beach bar/pool and recreational seaports area is 7 minute walk away from the main clubhouse but since we were the only visitors it was deserted . This island will be a great place for boaters once The Westing hotel and it's full amenities is up and running ."

No vegetarian options, so buffet was useless. Limited choices with food being made on best effort basis. Staff is very nice n Service is super good. Our experience of property went up to 4 star however tanked during departure. For 2.15 ferry departure, hotel asked us to leave at 1pm. We need to wait for entire ferry to clear immigration, today there 100 ppl. So waited over 1.5hr mostly standing n sweating as no fans or aircons. Then we had to que to clear immigration and scan everytjing though this is isolated island. So be ready and get ur food if u r vegetarian."
"60.","臧傑晧（Jeff Tsang）","13","2025-12-01","2","Resort ini masih belum sepenuhnya selesai hingga November 2025. Fasilitas seperti klub anak-anak dan vila di atas air masih dalam pembangunan. Untuk layanan yang sudah dibuka, jujur ​​saja saya merasa layanan tersebut masih kurang dari yang biasanya Anda harapkan dari sebuah resort Westin. 1. Proses check-in agak lambat. Meskipun lobi memiliki banyak tempat duduk dan mereka menawarkan minuman selamat datang dan handuk dingin, staf tidak mengarahkan tamu untuk duduk dan menunggu. Akibatnya, semua orang masih mengantre di konter, yang sangat disayangkan. 2. Kamarnya sendiri bagus, baru, dan didesain dengan selera tinggi. Namun, pintu geser kaca tidak tertutup rapat, sehingga setiap kali ada sedikit angin laut, suara angin di dalam kamar menjadi cukup keras, hampir seperti badai di luar. 3. Pulau ini tidak memiliki pantai dangkal yang luas, dan karena aktivitas manusia yang padat di sekitar area tersebut, garis pantai dipenuhi dengan bebatuan dan puing-puing. Satu-satunya pantai di pulau ini pada dasarnya tidak cocok untuk bersantai, dan Anda tidak akan dapat mengambil foto pantai berpasir yang bagus. 4. Karena pantai tidak dapat digunakan dan Anda tidak dapat berenang di laut, kolam renang tanpa batas (infinity pool) menjadi satu-satunya pilihan. Namun, kolam renangnya sangat kecil—sekitar 5x20 meter—untuk resor dengan setidaknya 100 kamar, dan hanya ada sedikit kursi berjemur. Rasanya seperti mereka tidak ingin terlalu banyak orang di kolam renang. 5. Peta menunjukkan beberapa jalur hutan, tetapi sebenarnya hanya beberapa jalur tangga pendek, tidak layak dikunjungi. Karena kolam renang dan pantai tidak praktis, pada dasarnya tidak ada tempat lain untuk dikunjungi. 6. Gedung-gedung tamu hanya setinggi tiga lantai, tetapi tidak ada lift. Tamu harus mengandalkan lereng dan tangga untuk berpindah antar lantai. 7. Pusat kebugaran sangat bagus, baik dari segi peralatan maupun pemandangan. 8. Lingkungan spa bagus, tetapi stafnya jelas kurang terlatih. Teknik pijatnya kurang konsisten, tekanannya tidak merata, dan menjelang akhir terapis tampak terburu-buru karena manajemen waktu yang buruk. 9. Untuk prasmanan luar ruangan hari Sabtu di Salt, makanannya enak, tetapi pencahayaannya terlalu redup, sehingga sulit untuk melihat apa yang Anda ambil. Tidak ada juga alat pemanas, jadi semua hidangan disajikan pada suhu ruangan. Akan lebih baik jika makanan tersebut tetap hangat. 10. Karena ini adalah prasmanan BBQ, saya berasumsi mereka ingin menampilkan proses memanggang yang segar, tetapi mereka menempatkan tusuk sate dan irisan daging mentah tepat di antara ikan bakar dan daging bakar yang sudah matang. Tamu yang tidak memperhatikan mungkin secara tidak sengaja mengambil makanan mentah. 11. Layanan koktail di Sunset Bar sangat lambat. Bahkan dengan hanya tiga kelompok tamu, dua koktail membutuhkan waktu 15 menit untuk sampai, dan minumannya tidak seimbang dan encer. Rasanya seperti mereka harus mencari resepnya secara online. 12. Sarapan di Island Kitchen sangat bagus—makanan enak, lingkungan yang indah, dan pemandangan yang menawan. Secara keseluruhan, pulau ini masih belum lengkap dan layanannya belum sepenuhnya sempurna. Jika Anda memiliki poin atau miles tambahan untuk ditukarkan dengan menginap gratis, mungkin ada baiknya datang untuk menginap di akhir pekan. Hotel ini belum sepenuhnya selesai (per November 2025). Fasilitas seperti klub anak-anak dan vila di atas air akan ditambahkan kemudian. Terus terang, layanan yang sudah dibuka masih jauh dari standar resor Westin yang seharusnya. 1. Proses check-in lambat. Meskipun lobi memiliki banyak tempat duduk dan menyediakan minuman selamat datang serta handuk dingin, mereka tidak mengarahkan tamu untuk duduk sambil menunggu, sehingga semua orang harus mengantre di konter, yang sangat disayangkan. 2. Kamar-kamar umumnya bagus, baru, dan didesain dengan baik. Namun, jendela dari lantai hingga langit-langit tidak tertutup rapat, sehingga bahkan angin laut yang sedikit pun menciptakan suara angin yang cukup keras di dalam kamar, membuat ruangan terasa seperti sedang diterpa badai. 3. Karena pulau itu sendiri tidak memiliki pantai dangkal yang cukup luas, dan perairan sekitarnya dipenuhi aktivitas manusia, pantai dipenuhi bebatuan dan sampah. Saat ini, satu-satunya pantai di pulau itu pada dasarnya tidak cocok untuk rekreasi, dan tentu saja, tidak mungkin untuk mengambil foto pantai yang indah. 4. Karena pantai tidak dapat digunakan, berenang di laut tidak mungkin dilakukan. Ditambah lagi, kolam renang infinity-nya cukup kecil. Hotel ini memiliki setidaknya 100 kamar, tetapi kolam renangnya hanya berukuran sekitar 5 x 20 meter, dengan hanya beberapa kursi santai, yang secara efektif membuat pengunjung enggan menggunakan kolam renang. 5. Peta hotel menunjukkan beberapa jalur hutan, tetapi hanya beberapa anak tangga pendek, tidak sepadan dengan usaha. Jadi, jika Anda tidak bisa pergi ke kolam renang atau pantai, sebenarnya tidak ada tempat lain untuk pergi. 6. Kamar-kamar tamu hanya setinggi tiga lantai, tetapi bangunan itu sendiri tidak memiliki lift; Anda harus menggunakan jalan landai dan tangga untuk naik dan turun. 7. Fasilitas gym dan pemandangannya fantastis. 8. Lingkungan spa bagus, tetapi stafnya jelas kurang terlatih. Teknik pijatnya tidak memuaskan, tekanannya tidak merata, dan menjelang akhir, waktunya tidak tepat, sehingga perawatannya terburu-buru. 9. Prasmanan luar ruangan di restoran Salt pada Sabtu malam memiliki makanan yang enak, tetapi pencahayaan di area persiapan makanan kurang baik, sehingga sulit untuk melihat apa yang Anda ambil. Selain itu, tidak ada sistem penghangat makanan, jadi makanan selalu berada pada suhu ruangan; akan lebih baik jika lebih hangat. 10. Selain itu, karena malam itu adalah prasmanan BBQ, mereka mungkin ingin menyajikan makanan seolah-olah baru dipanggang, jadi mereka menempatkan tusuk sate dan irisan daging mentah di antara area ikan bakar dan daging bakar yang sudah matang. Saya masih tidak mengerti, tetapi orang-orang yang tidak tahu ini mungkin akan mengambil daging mentah tersebut. 11. Minuman di Sunset Bar disajikan sangat lambat. Meskipun hanya ada tiga kelompok pelanggan di restoran, kami memesan dua koktail dan menunggu 15 menit hingga minuman tersebut tiba. Selain itu, rasa minumannya tidak merata, dan rasanya tidak cukup kuat. Mungkin mereka menghabiskan waktu mencari resep koktail secara online... 12. Island Kitchen memiliki makanan sarapan yang enak, lingkungan yang nyaman, dan pemandangan yang indah. Singkatnya, fasilitas di pulau ini saat ini belum lengkap, dan pelayanannya belum sempurna. Jika Anda memiliki poin atau miles tambahan yang dapat ditukarkan dengan akomodasi gratis, Anda mungkin mempertimbangkan untuk menginap satu malam di akhir pekan."
