"1.","Paul Fisher","274","2025-12-01","5","The Intercontinental Jimbaran Bali is an amazing experience, from the moment our driver dropped us off we were greeted by a Balinese lady wearing traditional kebaya with the sound of Balinese Gamelan music in the background. I must say the entrance and lobby are both amazing. The gardens are an oasis of tropical vibes and the sound of birds and water features. Our room was outstanding, we stayed in a two story suite on the forth floor with a balcony overlooking the gardens, located in building one. The room was clean and the king bed very comfortable. The air con was nice and cool and the toiletries are by Byredo with nice fragrance. They have many pools, the main pool has a pool bar looking over the beach. The restaurants located in the hotel are all good, a short walk outside the resort you will find many warungs, massage spas, convenience stores, cafes etc. you can also walk along the beach to the famous seafood restaurants on the beach, we will definitely be back to Intercontinental Jimbaran."

We are on our anniversary with our parents got the club mezzanine room it’s large and very comfortable. But only one minus thing is air con which I think it’s could be colder ?? As Bali it’s very very warm. Club staff are also very nice but when it’s come to very busy it’s will be slow service sometime. Overall we are got very pleasant to stay here and it’s will become our first choice if we are coming back to visit Bali again ! /thank you"

We recently held a retreat for 40 people at this hotel, and we are beyond impressed with the flawless experience from start to finish. The hotel's environment is stunning! The big swimming pool, nice beaches and lush gardens offered countless beautiful photo spots, allowing us to fully immerse in the perfect Balinese vibe. While the hotel has been established for some time, the rooms and facilities are very well-kept and preserved. And all rooms are very spacious. We hosted a welcome dinner at the Sunset Bar, which was an absolute triumph with its breathtaking views. The hotel also helped us arrange a sacred temple blessing ceremony, complete with traditional attire for our guests. It was a unique and deeply cultural experience that everyone loved and appreciated. A huge thank you to the Sales team, who was incredibly supportive and provided tremendous assistance throughout the planning process. The entire coordination were seamless. All staff members were exceptionally friendly and attentive, making us feel welcome at every turn. We highly recommend them for any group events and personal travellers. Look forward to returning!"
"4.","Mr Gee","32","2025-12-01","5","We had 3 nights at Intercontinental Resort Bali as a family. It is a large hotel with all the quality you expect from Intercontinental. The grounds are vast and immaculate. There are many pools to suit all ages though shade is a precious commodity and rather lacking. Access to the beach is easy and it’s lovely soft sand and clean. Plenty of food options in Sumter, breakfast by the pool was delightful way to start the day. Great staff and service. Ko, the Japanese restaurant was excellent though felt a little rushed to be hurrried out at 10pm but the sushi was divine. The sunset beach bar should have been an unforgettable place for cocktails and watching the sunset but rather loud live bands, some playing baby shark and other kids songs rather ruined the atmosphere. Our room was clean and comfortable allowing us quality sleep."
"5.","Abdulrahman Alamri","7","2025-12-01","5","Dear InterContinental Bali Resort Team, We would like to express our sincere appreciation for the warm welcome, excellent service, and exceptional attention we received throughout our stay at your wonderful resort. Our experience was truly memorable, and we are grateful for the hospitality shown to every member of our family. We would also like to extend our special thanks to Agus from Taman Gita Restaurant. His outstanding manners, genuine kindness, continuous attentiveness, and sincere dedication to his work left a remarkable impression on all of us. Please convey our heartfelt gratitude to him — every member of our family appreciates his efforts. Thank you once again for making our stay exceptional. We look forward to visiting your resort again in the future. Warm regards,"

Untuk service sangat baik dan cepat bahkan managernya datang untuk minta maaf. Juga kalau menginap beberapa hari, breakfastnya itu2 mulu sih gk banyak berubah dan untuk orng indonesia lebih baik order makanan khusus jgn ambil makanan prasmanan nya. Request khusus untuk nasi goreng atau mie goreng biar rasa nya medok. Parkiran juga cukup luas."
"7.","Stephanie Harriman","3","2025-12-11","5","During our stay, we had the pleasure of meeting a young gentleman Ananta at breakfast who stood out with his kindness and warm manner. Beyond that, every staff member was outstandingly friendly, welcoming, and respectful, always greeting us with a smile and wishing us a good day. The hospitality here truly made a difference in our experience."
"8.","GRAND AL","1686","2025-11-01","5","The IC Bali resort, what a majestic complex. So green and beautiful maintained. Has some pools, entertainment, restaurants. all you can wish for. Also it has some cabins for the beach itself. The staff is auper nice. The only one thing that i could mention is that the rooms and buildings are old. you see it really well in some places, but at least it is in a good shape. But for people who love modern rooms this is maybe not your fo to location. i really enjoyed it ."
"9.","Helen Woodward","3","2025-12-11","5","Exceptional service from all staff, better than other Bali resorts I've stayed in. We loved the elegant Club dining room, afternoon tea was a highlight, the food was excellent in all venues. We enjoyed the smaller but more intimate Club pool. Special mention: Yunda, Dai Wi (Club manager) and Lisa (hair stylist in the beauty salon) and many more, all professional, friendly and seamlessly efficient. Thanks for a delightful holiday!"
"10.","Dewi Soumiadatri","34","2025-12-25","2","Pros: beautiful landscape, luxurious amenities such as shampoo and soap. Good intercontinental brand. House keeping is regular however the phone smells like smoke when you made call. They might forget to clean the phone handle. Cons: Food in random 3 star hotel in Kuta is way better than their food. I got food poisoning and vomiting badly from the breakfast. I suspected from the old rice that they stored in the fridge and served it again and again. Rice was dry and old. My daughter got food poisoning from the milk. Most of the food choice is not fresh maybe prepared day before to cater big number of guests. We tried the dinner and the same case, you will expect quality food from such lux resort however they served cold food with no salt taste. Service at the activity center near the pool was very rude. They assumed that we stayed 1 night just because I am not foreigner, we stayed 9 nights. One other guy also made rude comment in Balinese language stating that non white guests are just burden when I picked up towels. I am Balinese and understood the comment however I did not confront them but truly annoyed by the comment. They smile n being polite at the front but made cynical comments at your back in Balinese language. Spoiling my holiday feeling being treated like we are burden. On the bright side, The people at the front lobby who greet the guests are the best. Very professional and helpful. Thank you to them. Unfortunately no I will not give my business in the future again."
"11.","Amanda","93","2025-11-01","5","Good sized room not too cramp. Clean. Great amenities. Great service, nice locations lots of eateries nearby (walking distance via the beach if you want seafood), love the direct access to the beach. The downside is that the beach is not as beautiful as nusa dua beach (clear water, white sand), but still clean enough to swim around. Second, this maybe the first 5star hotel i visited which we have to pay if we want to join ANY kids activities (even only flying kite). Luckily my kid only loves to play in the beach ;) kids club probably more suited for up to 4yo. Other than that, this hotel is fantastic n we love it."
"12.","Belinda Piesse","8","2025-11-01","5","⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ We recently stayed at the InterContinental Bali Resort and had the most incredible experience. From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed with warmth and hospitality, and every detail of our stay was perfect. What truly stood out was the staff. They went above and beyond to make us feel like royalty. Traveling with a food allergy can often be stressful, but the team ensured I was always well taken care of. Their thoughtfulness made our holiday not only stress-free but unforgettable. A special thank you to: Eko – Manager at Taman Gita Suyasna – Waiter at Taman Gita Lingga – Waiter at Taman Gita Ananta – Waiter at Taman Gita Suyra – Manager at Jimbaran Gardens Kusuma – Belle Cucina Each of them showed genuine care, kindness, and attention to detail that made our stay so memorable. The resort itself is stunning — beautiful grounds, amazing facilities, and such a peaceful atmosphere — but it was the people who made it truly special. We leave with the happiest memories and can’t wait to return. Highly recommend to anyone visiting Bali!"
"13.","Dorene Mae","121","2025-11-01","5","Stayed in Room 4316 The room felt quite damp due to humidity, and there was a persistent urine smell in the toilet that didn’t go away. The shower could use a deep clean — I found patches of mould that blended in with the marble veining. Our balcony had a lovely view of the gardens with a glimpse of the ocean, but unfortunately, it received no sunlight, making it difficult to dry wet swimwear and leaving the room feeling damp and humid. We later realised that opening the balcony door made the hardwood floors wet from condensation. The couch had noticeable stains. Although staff clearly tried to clean it, as a bit of a germophobe, I couldn’t bring myself to sit or lie on it without placing a towel first. The bedding was okay, though the pillows flattened quickly and weren’t very supportive. It’s clear this is a 30-year-old property, and I can imagine how stunning it must have been in its prime. In retrospect, I should’ve requested a room change once I realised we were in one of the older rooms, but since we arrived late at night and had a toddler in tow, it was easier to settle in. That said, everything outside the guest room was absolutely fantastic. The staff truly make this resort special — so genuine, warm, and hospitable. Reception and the bell desk were always ready to help with deliveries, questions, or small change. Housekeeping serviced our room twice daily, which was a lovely touch. Breakfast at Taman Gita was phenomenal — a proper 5-star spread. We enjoyed sitting in different areas each morning: sometimes outside overlooking the bridge with the trio musicians, sometimes on the balcony facing the lotus pond. Special thanks to Suyasna, Oka, Widi, and Tiwi, who were all exceptional. The service across the resort was consistently impressive. For example, when dining at Sunset Beach or Jimbaran Gardens, staff would always check how everything was — even when we simply couldn’t finish a dish. Oka at breakfast remembered how much my daughter loved rambutan and surprised her with a freshly peeled bowl on our last day, even though it wasn’t available on the buffet. Sunasya even made me jackfruit fritters after noticing I loved the fresh jackfruit — they were divine. The staff at the pool bar and Jimbaran Gardens were equally wonderful. We had no issues finding a sun lounge as it was a quiet period, though I imagine it gets busier during school holidays. My tip: head to the pool to reserve a lounge before breakfast — by the time you finish, it’s perfect for a swim. Jimbaran Beach is gorgeous — soft sand and clean during our stay. While it’s a public beach with seafood restaurants at one end (and the occasional bit of rubbish, like in most developing countries), the stretch in front of the resort was well maintained. The pools were lovely, though the main one could use a bit more shade. Despite the room’s shortcomings, I would highly recommend InterContinental Bali Jimbaran for its incredible staff, beautiful grounds, and excellent facilities. We’d definitely return."
"14.","Emre Ozturk","35","2025-09-01","5","We truly regret not booking a longer stay at this hotel. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly, making us feel very welcome. The property never felt overcrowded, and the sunbed areas were well-spaced, allowing for a very relaxing and peaceful holiday. You can even order directly to your sunbed via QR code, which is very convenient. The restaurants are elegant, and the food is absolutely delicious. Rooms are clean, comfortable, and well-maintained. We especially enjoyed playing in the waves and taking sunset walks along the wide beach—it was such a memorable experience. The hotel is also very close to the airport, which made us realize it would have been the perfect place for our last night before flying home. Considering Bali’s heavy traffic, this location is ideal for a final stop before departure. I would definitely recommend it to others looking for a stress-free stay before their return flight."
"15.","Matthew Sainsbury","20","2025-10-01","3","This is a five star resort, in a five star location, with five star service. Stunning pools everywhere with plenty of deck chairs, a beautiful beach right there, and multiple food (western and Indonesian) and drink options. The breakfast buffet was particularly impressive. Staff were friendly, helpful, and plentiful. The room was wonderfully comfortable and the shower decadent. The location is also excellent. About 20 minutes from the airport, and providing excellent access to the entire (beautiful) south of the island. To be clear I absolutely loved the hotel and would stay there again without a second thought. So why the rating? Unfortunately the noise leak from our room to our neighbour’s was terrible and there was a young family there with two young kids and a baby. When we’re paying five star rates and specifically looking to relax, being woken by a screaming baby just isn’t acceptable."
"16.","Simon Norra","55","2025-11-01","5","From the moment we arrived, everything was pure perfection. The resort offers a fantastic variety of restaurants, each with its own atmosphere and excellent cuisine, making every meal a new highlight. By night, the entire hotel transforms into a dreamlike scene with its stunning light design, creating a warm and elegant ambiance across the gardens and pools. A beautiful and unforgettable stay."
"17.","adnama ewor","12","2025-10-01","5","I want to tell you that this has been THE MOST amazing stay. The service is impeccable. The staff are so happy and kind and want to ensure you have a wonderful time. The food is great. The room is super comfy and quiet. The entire resort is so clean. The facilities are so good. Activities are fun. The beach is great. Only wish is that they do beach chairs but we rented the cabana and that was great. I highly recommend this resort!!!"
"18.","Daniel Singh","6","2025-11-01","5","I've stayed in many IHG resorts BUT this resort stood out among the rest as it was Intercontinental Resort. My wife & I enjoyed it very much and the sad part was we should have stayed for few more days only to enjoy the facilities. My son stays at IHG as he's a Platinum member. He said he doesn't go out of resorts as he enjoys the stay at Intercontinental Resorts. I promised myself never to go back to Bali 10 years ago bcoz of behaviour of young Australian tourists who behave like hooligans in Bali. We only went for a wedding and Intercontinental changed my mind. We enjoyed it very much this time. Yes the GRAB driver cheated us from Intercontinental to airport. He asked me for 20,000 Rupiah which we paid him in cash BUT sitting in the lounge my email disclosed that I was charged 70,000 Rupiah as well. This left a bitter taste in my mouth. The amount was meaningless ($A5.46) but cheating is what I don't like. I wrote to Grab & they refunded the amount and took strong action against the Grab Driver. I felt relieved that there are good companies and people in this world. PS. Lesson learnt: To pay by credit and get receipt on email."
"19.","poussin kechit","22","2025-09-01","5","Currently staying at the InterContinental Bali and the experience is absolutely wonderful. The Balinese Suite is stunning — spacious, tastefully decorated, and beautifully blending traditional Balinese charm with modern comfort. The artwork throughout adds a refined and authentic touch. The pools are gorgeous, the beach is clean and peaceful, and the restaurants serve excellent, well-prepared food with great variety. The staff is extremely welcoming and helpful. A special thank you to Yulia for her kindness and attentiveness, and to Agung Joni for her quiet professionalism and care. This place perfectly balances heritage and modernity. We’re enjoying every moment."
"20.","Ling Chen","15","2025-12-01","5","On the day of check-in, there was a small issue with the room. Ms. Vinola resolved it very professionally and quickly. She promptly fixed the original problem and, with her warm and attentive service, took care of every detail thoughtfully. Thanks to her help, my entire four-day stay was extremely comfortable."
"21.","John Webb","8","2025-10-01","5","If sunsets are your thing, this is certainly your go to luxury tropical resort on Jimbaran Bay. We stayed for 5 nights and could honestly not fault a single thing. From the moment you arrive you are greeted so warmly by the staff, and service throughout the hotel, and our stay were absolutely amazing, every single staff member makes you feel special. The gardens are so lush and very well maintained, a delight for the eyes."
"22.","Uzayr Ali","46","2025-08-01","4","Stayed here in June. It was a pleasant stay, the hotel grounds are big and nicely maintained for the most part. The room was spacious and clean but had some evident signs of wear and tear, this carried through to the hallways as well. The breakfast buffet had a good variety of choices, it does get busy in the mornings and it's been the first time I've had to queue for breakfast at a hotel. Service was good, although the attendants at the breakfast service sometimes came across cold. I really enjoyed the sunset restaurant, it was a really nice atmosphere with lovely staff. Overall would maybe return if I could score a good offer!"
"23.","Ronald en Sandra","12","2025-12-25","5","It is a Great Hotel! Especially the service is great. I can recommend all the restaurants. They all have their own identity, and the food is delicious. Chef Rahmat prepares the most delicious menus."
"24.","Rachel M","9","2025-12-01","5","The spa at the Intercontinental is truly amazing, from its relaxing atmosphere to the comfort of the massages. Marni, the staff who served me is incredibly friendly and helpful, and the consultation regarding my massage needs was spot on. I enjoyed the Bali Ocean Serenity Spa experience. After indulging in hot water baths and a sauna session, the massage was more relaxing than I could have imagined! I highly recommend this spa."
"25.","Clement Garzon","7","2025-12-04","5","Beautiful stay in Intercontinental Bali. We enjoyed everything. The rooms are spacious. The breakfast is really great, special mention to Dicky ! All the staff are friendly and careful. I defenitly recommend the place."
"26.","Debbie Elder","6","2025-10-01","5","Great hotel stay! Staff are fantastic and always friendly and welcoming. Really looked after me with my dietary restrictions of gluten free. Rooms are spotless and very comfortable. Breakfast was one of the best we have had. Shout out to Dinda and her colleagues at Sunset bar for dinner."
"27.","Peer Spengler","3","2025-11-01","3","We stayed a few nights at the InterContinental Bali after coming from a smaller boutique resort in Ubud. The property itself is beautiful, well maintained despite its age, and the staff are exceptionally friendly and professional. However, the guest experience feels less balanced due to the visible separation between Club InterContinental guests and regular guests, especially at the beach area. The Club section was mostly empty during the day, while the regular area was crowded, and several Club guests still used the non-Club section instead of their designated area. When I asked about using one of the many vacant Club loungers in the shaded area, I was politely but firmly told no and directed to the regular section. It is not that the Club area looks nicer, it is simply empty, while the regular section lacks shaded loungers and feels overcrowded. This policy creates an unnecessary divide that does not reflect the warmth and kindness of the staff, who were truly wonderful throughout our stay."
"28.","Photo Yayy","8","2025-09-01","4","Five stars service for all the staff! Beautiful resort! You could hear the birds sing in the morning 😊 The only down side is that the room consistently smell a bit damped (hopefully no mould around) which could feel a bit hard to truly relax. Restaurants and laundry are way too expensive, apparently it’s 5 to 10 times more expensive than local Bali price."
"29.","Joy C","5","2025-10-01","5","Angga at the breakfast served us and he was so friendly and helpful! Intercontinental staff standard are very high and they uphold 5 star services value very well. My 3rd time to be back with my family and definitely will come back again. Highly recommended for family great clean pool, bigger room than standard size, and nice food. Breakfast buffet are one of the best in the world. So fresh and tasty. Thanks for having us!"
"30.","Wong Cho Wai","5","2025-10-01","5","My recent stay at the InterContinental Bali Resort in Jimbaran was fantastic, and I'm already looking forward to my next visit. The rooms were spacious, clean, providing a perfect sanctuary after a day of exploring. What truly sets this resort apart is the outstanding service from the staff. From the front desk to the restaurant servers, everyone was incredibly friendly, attentive, and genuinely went above and beyond to ensure I had a fantastic experience. Beyond the excellent service and food, the resort’s grounds are lovely. I loved having direct access to the beach, ideal for morning walks and watching sunsets."
"31.","Miles Templeton","189","2025-08-01","5","We had a truly enjoyable family holiday at InterContinental Bali. The resort is beautifully set on manicured gardens with a direct beachfront location—a perfect backdrop for a relaxing getaway. We stayed in a mezzanine room, which was spacious and ideal for families with kids. The highlight of our stay was undoubtedly the Club Lounge experience. We had access to the lounge, which included afternoon tea and an exceptional level of personalised service. The staff here were absolutely outstanding—always smiling, attentive, and genuinely welcoming. Special thanks to Dela, Indra, Rudi, Deva, Yunda, Gita, Rama, Yoga, Mika, and Aditya. Their warmth and professionalism made every visit to the lounge feel special. The resort features two large pools, both fantastic for families and well maintained. We also want to acknowledge Bagiada from the pool staff—friendly and helpful throughout. We booked a family photoshoot with Sedhar, the resort photographer, who was caring, kind, and patient, making the whole experience enjoyable and relaxed. Dining-wise, the resort offers two main onsite options: Taman Gita (Gardens) and Sunset Beach Bar & Grill. While the staff were friendly, we found the food and service to be average. We dined onsite mostly for convenience, but for future guests, we’d recommend exploring local restaurants outside the resort for a more memorable culinary experience. All in all, a beautiful resort with exceptional service in the Club Lounge, great for families, and a stunning location to unwind in Bali."
"32.","Eman Athans","85","2025-10-01","5","Amazing property, lush gardens and beachfront access with kid friendly facilities which is a plus. Staff are super friendly and go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable. Some concern with damp rooms though. Ask for a dehumidifier and air purifier if you feel required. Even though we went in a busy period, it doesn’t feel overcrowded due to the large property size. Club lounge facilities and staff are top notch."
"33.","Trindade Cafe","10","2025-09-01","5","Best experience ever. Incredible Resort with impeccable service and out of this world surroundings with extremely well looked after gardens, great pools, and delicious food in all restaurants. Buffet breakfast was sensational and plenty. It is on the pricier side as it’s expected for a 5stars resort right on the beach, but totally worth it. Talking about beach, Jimbaran beach is not what some people say on their comments, ar least wasn’t our experience. We found the beach beautiful, very peaceful, with perfect swimming, great walks and not busy (like some other beaches in the region) it only got busier at Sunset for the Seafood sunset dinner (which by the way was delicious and totally worth it, we went to Made Bagus). The sunsets on the beach, or from the Resort are like a dream. The staff is amazing and really do their very best to make sure you have the best experience. We’ll definitely go back."
"34.","DWI ANDI LISTIAWAN","18","2025-12-25","1","Table Management di Restoran Taman Gita saat weekend buruk sekali, karena rame banget kami keluarga ber-6 dikasih meja buat ber-4 saja. Minta 4+2 awalnya boleh jadi tidak boleh."
"35.","Monica Marie Naka","1","2025-08-01","5","I loved this hotel! Everything was great, from the service, amenities, and the food! My favorite part was the breakfast buffet! The food changed everyday and Ananta was always so kind to us! He would greet us every morning and asked us if we wanted anything special or asked if we wanted anything that was not in the buffet! I loved dragon fruit so he would bring us dragon fruit every morning with no questions asked! He was the sweetest and always had a bright smile! Every person in this hotel is always so sweet and accommodating! We will be coming back for sure!"
"36.","Kinna Patel","28","2025-08-01","5","Lovely hotel - excellent staff who make the experience of being in such a big hotel very personal. Good spot on the beach and we enjoyed a lovely evening having dinner and drinks. The staff especially Renata and Sukra definitely enhance the experience. The views and peace make it a super fun way to relax and soak up Jimbaran. The only downside has been the length of time it took to check in and then a further couple of hours delay to get the room - well.past 5pm by this time - only to.find the room allocation was not what had been requested and agreed. However, the hotel and staff are a good choice in Jimbaran."
"37.","Jayne Lanyi","3","2025-11-01","5","Such a comfortable and luxurious stay in Jimbaran hard to fault the property and service is outstanding. Great breakfast and other meals really enjoyed our stay at Intercontinental with special shout out to Ananta for his warm and attentive service at Taman Gita made our breakfast very enjoyable with mangosteens and Balinese name and caste discussion, thanks! Steve and Jayne."
"38.","Shadia G","11","2025-10-01","5","We've had such a wonderful experience at the intercontinental. The rooms were spacious, the resort is clean and picturesque and the staff were amazing. Especially Suyasna at breakfast who went out of his way to chat to our daughter everyday and bring her her favourite fruits. We'll be back! Highly recommend."
"39.","T Kross","316","2025-09-01","5","Such a beautiful hotel! The Japanese restaurant is excellent, and the breakfast buffet at both venues offers a great variety and quality. The only drawback was the service at the sunset bar, where the staff seemed unprepared for requests outside the usual routine. That aside, the overall stay was wonderful. Highly recommended!"
"40.","Pingyuan Chen","92","2025-09-01","5","I booked a room with club access as an IC Ambassador member, and got upgraded to a mezzanine suite. Yes the place seems a little bit aged, but I must say the experience was wonderful-- the staffs were extremely friendly and welcoming, the facilities were more than complete, superior beach access and good pools with bars, great access to nearby seafood (or other) restaurants, and the airport is also quite close by. The only thing I didn't like of my room was stinky sofa pillows. Definitely want to stay at IC Bali Resort next time I am here!"
"41.","Francesco baraldo sano","645","2025-12-01","5","A PARADISE ! No words could explain how good and nice is this resort . I am Diamond and Ambassador member IHG and I have seen a lot of Intercontinental, but this is speciale ! 360° special !

"42.","Yuyu Cendra","13","2025-11-01","5","Pertama kali menginap di Intercontinental Bali. Kamar memang agak Klasik bukan tipe modern minimalis. Vibesnya Bali banget. Property guede banget. Staf nya ramah banget dan helpful. Special thanks to Pak Eric Front desk dan Pak Ngurah Jimbaran Garden resto krn sdh bantu temukan kacamata renang anak saya. Bfast leader Pak Budi super friendly. And thanks Bu Thalia for arranging kamar view pool. Will come back for sure"
"43.","Cat Fink","13","2025-08-01","5","Our feedback about this awesome resort is very, very positive. Last year we stayed at the Bali Intercon and loved it and so returned again last week and honestly, this is an amazing hotel. The staff are professional yet friendly, the food is excellent and the grounds are superb. The beach location is brilliant to top things off. This stay was a special one for my wife and I as we were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary. We received an upgrade which was unexpected and very thoughtful - we hugely appreciated it. We stayed (two rooms) with two teens and they love it too - no mean feat!"
"44.","irwan lubis","187","2025-11-01","5","Hotel lama tapi terawat dengan baik. Walapun sedikit agak apek, tapi pengalaman menginap disini menyenangkan. Kamar luas dan bersih. Bantal kasur selimut nyaman. Kamar mandi ada bathtub dan shower yang terpisah. Terdapat 3 kolam renang dan memiliki akses langsung ke pantai. Untuk berjemur sangat nyaman. Sarapan ada 2 resto, dekat lobby dan dekat kolam. Cuma klo dekat kolam pilihan menu sedikit. Parkir luas. Ada atm mandiri dan butik."
"45.","Pui Yip Hui","40","2025-08-01","5","Delayed room check-in for more than half an hour but offered a room upgrade and club lounge access. Superb good in garden restaurant and amazing landscapes. Staff are friendly and informative. Great service and experience in club lounge. A bit let down on game room with only a tennis table and a couple of board games. With no pool table or other arcade games."
"46.","Ross B. Taylor AM","65","2025-09-01","5","We have stayed at this hotel on a number of occasions. Always top class, stylish, beautiful. Until Luxury Escapes decided to do a big promotion that has seen this big resort jammed pack with families and kids. We love kids and our grandchildren who we allocate 24 hours a week to. This resort was our sanctuary. But not now. All cafes booked out, selections unavailable, pool like a bee-hive and every sunlounge along the large shoreline taken by 8am. It must be said, however that August is peak season, so quality hotels like this can be booked-out. June is usually a little quieter."
"47.","E","54","2025-11-01","2","We always loved this place and always had great experiences but unfortunately this last visit a big turn off and definitely not great. Property needs lots of maintenance, rooms are outdated and bad smell. It’s not the 5* anymore from the past Lots of improvements needed think twice to stay, service at club lounge still perfect to be honest but all over not worth the price sorry"
"48.","Gammara Fiermandaputra","95","2025-08-01","5","One of the best hotels in Bali for staying with kids! Alasannya simpel: ada banyak sekali aktifitas yang bisa dilakukan bareng anak-anak. Bisa main di kids club (ada mini pool yang cocok sampai anak umur 12 tahun), ada outdoor playground (dan tambahan lapangan bola mini - tapi harus bawa bola sendiri ya), ada tennis court buat yang masih belajar atau cari fun, variety of swimming pools (total ada 4), ada arcade dan pingpong room, etc. banyak pokoknya!"
"49.","Irene Grow","20","2025-07-01","5","I recently stayed with my partner at your hotel for 8 nights and was more than pleasantly surprised at the resort and customer service given by the staff - they couldn't do enough for us. Our room was spacious and close to the lobby. Would recommend this resort to anyone who wants a chilled out luxurious holiday right on the beach. Thank you all for making our holiday memorable."

"52.","酒井英一郎（Eddy）","8","2025-08-01","1","The location of this hotel is excellent. It’s only 15 minutes from the airport, a 5-minute walk to the famous seafood stalls, and the coastline is perfect for early morning walks. On the other hand, the facilities and service might be the worst. Even when making requests at the front desk, they are often forgotten and rarely followed up on. The restaurant is overpriced and the food is terrible. The waitstaff is extremely rude, especially a young man named Sudiska, whose behavior was particularly disrespectful. He needs proper training. The pool is old and lacks a sense of cleanliness. This hotel may suit those who only care about location, but I would not recommend it to anyone who values good service. I had been an IHG Diamond member but decided to exit the membership due to this bad experience at Intercontinental Bali."
"53.","Sarah charles (Thewhereto)","1567","2025-08-01","5","Whilst pricy, having experienced this resort, it is definitely worth every dollar. The resort has everything you need, and they do it so well. Arriving at the lobby, it’s is classic Intercontinental style, a huge sculpture and Indonesian art aplenty. It is expansive with multiple areas to sit and lounge whilst you wait or even after check out. Plenty of counters, a concierge and welcome drinks. The staff carefully manicure all the lawns and we can see them spending hours on garden upkeep, and it looks amazing. We find our room, and it reminds me similarly of other Intercontinental rooms we’ve stayed in, so the brand really keeps up that reputation. The beds are comfortable though we book for three, we had to pay an extra $29 USD for a child bed. I’m strongly opposed to that and professed this prior to booking and upon arrival. If you book for three, there should be beds for three. Thus extra cost is exorbitant and unfair. Otherwise, we are happy, the room is spacious - balcony, couch, tv, coffee and tea making facilities, a huge bathroom, gowns and slippers. Rooms have safes and irons. The plugs are not international and only have one USB port so technology is a tad old. Don’t forget your adapter. This resort is on Jimbaran Beach so you can easily walk out onto the beach, for a dip in the ocean, or to visit a beachside seafood restaurant. As far as the whole Intercontinental property goes, it is enormous, 36 acres to be exact. Guests don’t have to leave the hotel, unless you plan to go on tours. However, given its pricy nature, we did walk out into the main strip for some great restaurants, laundry, coffee and massage. But if you’ve got the cash, by all means get it all done in the Intercontinental because obviously it’s amazing. We did what we could in the realm of our budgets. The site has wellness spaces; massage, hairdresser. The jacuzzi was awesome, no extra charge. The facilities are divided into male and female areas, each with a steam room, a sauna, hot tub and a plunge pool, plus lockers and showers. There are multiple pools including one with a swim up pool bar. People lounge all day and “reserve” their pool beds so to speak. So get out early, plonk your towel or book there and you’re set for the day. You can also have tennis lessons, hire bikes or do Pilates and a number of their other wellness experiences - keep in kind most of them cost. Holidays are also a lot about eating - so make visits to their various dining spaces. There’s a fancier restaurant, Bella Cucina, Ko Restaurant, a Japanese venue with Japanese outdoor gardens and this offers both teppanyaki and Ala carte. For most of us though, you’d be visiting Jimbaran Gardens, a poolside eatery which hosts the breakfast buffet and Ala carte over lunch and dinner. There’s Also Sunset Beach Bar & Grill, overlooking the ocean, and Taman Gita for the other buffet site. We mostly ate from the buffet and the occasional meal down at Jimbaran Gardens. The food at the buffet was outstanding; Cereals, yoghurt and fruits, an egg station, bread buffet, western and local hot dishes and also Ala carte options to order like avo from n toast or Benedict. The other buffet venue even had a whole kids station with special foods to suit their fancy. We were impressed with the food here and couldn’t have asked for anything more. One of the other great things about the intercontinental is the kids club, I mean that’s the whole reason we booked! Planet Trekkers has great staff, and it’s open long hours. The staff run plenty of activities (at extra charge) and take such good care of the children overall, we loved our stay and would definitely go again, if we got a good luxury escape deal!"

"55.","Luke Short","18","2025-08-01","5","Fabulous experience again. This is our third time at the resort and the standard remains very high. Service is excellent, the staff are very friendly and responsive and the hotel grounds are impeccable. Recommend staying in a club room. While they are more expensive, they include access to the beautiful club lounge where you can have a great daily breakfast, high tea (2-4pm) and sunset cocktails (5-7pm). Pop in there anytime during the day for complimentary tea/coffee or soft drink. Another perk is the exclusive club pool, surrounded by cabanas and sun loungers where you can sip on complimentary non-alcoholic drinks all day and cocktails from 5-7pm. Whether for weeks or days, the InterCon Jimbaran Bay is a great way to relax and unwind from the real world. It’s family-friendly and only 25 mins or so from the airport, so you’re not schlepping around in the Bali traffic for long heading from/to the airport. Highly recommend this hotel. People make the difference and I really want to call out Monica, Antara and Dewi for making our stay so special. Nothing was too hard for them and we appreciated their personal touch to everything. The team at Intercontinental Jimbaran Beach are first class."
"56.","Pamela Stewart","5","2025-07-01","5","Recently had an eight day stay…our fifth visit. No complaints at all. A fabulous hotel in every regard but especially the service. The Club Lounge was wonderful…special mention to all the staff there and especially the client service ladies. Spa was exceptional and we loved all the restaurants. Will definitely be back."
"57.","barsdan","88","2025-09-01","5","We were on a businesstrip to bali and luckily got a chance to stay 1 night in the resort. It's a 5 star resort, although not new, still has a complete facility we can enjoy while staying here. Its located by the jimbaran beach where we could walk or relax along the beach. Once checked in we got the enjoyment of our rooms being upgraded to premier rooms. There are multiple pools, with one mini pool for children. The jogging track is sufficient for morning or afternoon jog whilst enjoying sunset. It also has a fitness room, yoga class etc. So i guessed no visitor could be dissapointed The room is extra large with seaview balcony. The breakfast was great with indoneseian, asian and western meals."
"58.","And","10","2025-10-01","2","I playing tennis more than a year here. After night rain I’ve called at 8am to check courts conditions. Staff told me that’s all right. When I arrived I saw that only one court is ready where are the local coach works. Another court which I booked was wet. I asked to swipe it. When the person arrived he looks rude and he said if I don’t like it I need to play in another place. Thank you for your “five stars” service!"

"61.","Sara Dee","26","2025-07-01","5","Beautiful rooms and service. The club rooms are great as you can eat by the club pool instead of going to the lounge . The only downside is the food service is slow in Jimbaran Gardens, which was hard with kids but they were super apologetic. Food was delicious though. Just order early when having kids is my recommendation:)"
"62.","Paul Dengate","49","2025-10-01","5","If yui want to be looked after perfectly, this is THE place to go. We have been to Bali five times and are used to Bali's excellent hospitality - but the staff at the Intercontinntal take it to another leevel - pretty much perfect. There could not be a finer collection of people. Our rooms were fantastic, super comfortable beds and lovely garden views. We ar already intending to stay here again, it was so nice . PS the main pool is bequtifully warm and Bella Cucine is absolute fine dining at its best - the Osso Bucco was literally perfect . Highly recomended!"
"63.","David & Man-Yee Rivadillo","16","2025-08-01","5","Excellent buffet breakfast, and the floor staff at Taman Gita are incredibly helpful and welcoming. Family room was spacious and comfortable, if I’m being picky pillows could firmer as they were extremely soft and sofa bed for kids could have been firmer. Swimming pools, outdoor playground, beach access , spa sauna access, sunset views 👌👌. Service needed to be quicker at Jimbaran Garden and definitely at sunset grill - order early if with kids. Afternoon tea in the lounge was a lovely touch. Would recommend more additions to kids club room to cater for kids 5 plus - activities were great and my kids enjoyed making kites and fishing. Overall an excellent stay, very friendly staff especially at breakfast, would love to stay again."

We had a small issue with our previous room, which they resolved with exceptional kindness, professionalism, and helpfulness. This is exactly the kind of service that makes all the difference: not only the beautiful resort itself, but above all the warmth and hospitality of the people is the reason why we love Bali – and why we are already certain that we will return next year. Thanks to Asih, Yuni and the whole Team we once again feel truly welcomed and well taken care of at the Intercontinental Bali Resort, allowing us to fully enjoy our holiday. Their dedication and genuine hospitality have played a significant role in making our stay so very special. Terima kasih & see you next year! 🌺"

"70.","Dewata Journey","1","2025-10-01","1","At the CT Asia 2025 event, I had a very disappointing experience. The staff stationed at the entrance were not informed about the actual start time or the correct conference room. Some said it would begin at 2 PM, others said it was not open, and in the end, the conference was held in a different room upstairs. When I asked why there was such a miscommunication, I learned that the staff were only daily workers who had not been properly briefed by their supervisors. Even worse, the staff I spoke to provided incorrect information, which caused unnecessary confusion. Because of this lack of coordination and communication, my time was completely wasted. For an event of this scale, I expected a higher level of professionalism and organization."
"71.","emna ayari","16","2025-09-01","1","I requested a date change on August 6th, fully within policy. Instead of honoring it, the hotel stalled for days, repeatedly asking for proof and personal reasons — things their own policy doesn’t require. I still gave my reason and even sent my flight ticket, yet as of August 10th, they’ve done nothing. A 5-star name with 1-star efficiency."

Thanks and maybe we will be back again!"

Overall, 5 star experience for this 5 star hotel."
"76.","larry hurt","18","2025-08-01","5","The most reasonably priced 5 star hotel in Jimbaran, the hotel grounds and restaurants are 5 star, the view from our balcony of the garden was lovely, would definitely recommend staying here if you’re after a more quiet and relaxed stay. Had a small technical issue not being able to plug my Amazon streaming stick into the back of the tv in the room, but they were so quick in resolving the issue so I have to give Mr Joni and his technical team top marks for resolving the issue in double quick time thank you. My only negative which is not about the hotel but Bali in general is the traffic, it’s horrendous! My my advice is make sure you have enough choices of local restaurants within walking distance from the hotel to choose from, thankfully we have plenty of restaurants within 5mins of waking out the front onto the street and also at the rear of the hotel along the beach. However trying to get a Grab taxi to far away locations like temples and The Rock Bar the traffic is heavy all the time, whatever time Google maps is quoting you then double/triple that travel time!!!!"

"78.","Ryan","26","2025-07-01","3","The resort is nice and the staff is friendly, but I have a hard time seeing the value for the cost. For example, you can rent a surfboard for 200,00 IDR/hour or you can walk one minute down the beach of the resort and pay 100,000 IDR/day. I am not opposed to staying here again but would look for other options nearby and give them a try before coming back."
"79.","Michelle Julier","21","2025-07-01","4","The service at garden bar and sunset Beach bar and grill have been outstanding. Sudiksa was a lovely host at lunch, and made sure we had enough food and enjoyed our time. Views are impeccable. Shisha is next level!! Joni and Nico at guest services went above and beyond to rectify any issues we had as we came in a peak time and some things weren't 100% when we arrived. The spa and wellness facilities are stunning. A must use when staying here."

"83.","Hi I Am","507","2025-07-01","4","We spent 2 nights here. The property is huge. Intercontinental’s staff made us feel welcome and their hospitality was above and beyond. The only negative thing to say, is there is a really strong musty smell in the room. It did not go away on its own. Because we were celebrating our anniversary and they kindly decorated our room including putting rose petals in our bathtub we didn’t want to bother changing rooms. Otherwise I would have asked to change. The musty smell did give me a headache but I just put up with it. The breakfast buffet is a must have here. So many variety and the dining area is beautiful. You also have a choice of eating outside and they had live Balinese music playing. During the rest of the day they have live piano and Balinese music in the lobby. The manager was nice to come around and ask if we needed anything and when I told him I’d like more mangosteens he went into the back kitchen to get some more for us. We appreciated that gesture so much. There were lots of different pools on the property. Unfortunately we didn’t use it. The beach is close by and there were plenty of lounge chairs on the property. It was also kept very clean. We enjoyed looking at the different art paintings as well. We also used the jacuzzi, sauna and steam room. It was very nice."

"85.","Sharyn","13","2025-07-01","5","Spent 4 wonderful days at this resort, everything was seamless and effortless. The staff here make a huge concerted effort to streamline your experience, from check in to check out. We had two rooms booked, and had access to the Club Lounge (definitely worth the splurge). Karliya and all the other staff at the Club Lounge were so warm and welcoming right from the beginning and looked after us throughout our stay. They made us feel right at home with suggestions of what to do, and try in the region and within the resort. I’ve not felt this type of personalised welcome before, so it was such a treat. Service aside, the resort was recently renovated (during COVID) so felt extremely modern and luxurious. The grounds are so well maintained and the rooms an absolute delight. The resort leads right onto a pristine beach, and close by there are lots of BBQ seafood on the beach options to choose. I will definitely be coming back here next time I’m in Bali, and can’t imagine staying anywhere else. Loved every moment, huge thank you to all the staff who made our stay so memorable."

Complained when I got a leak from the ceiling and was moved to an upgraded room - that had other issues - gave up complaining. Others in my party also had issues with their rooms .Big resort with a lot of facilities. Food is okay but I only ate breakfast and stuck to bread and cheese. Couldn't stomach lunch or dinner. Not impressed overall but the staff were friendly, very polite and very helpful. The pools and beach are nice and they have little kids club. Wouldn't come here again by choice and only here because of a corporate booking. For the money find someplace else I stayed in a luxury villa for a third of the price. I'm have to say I'm not a fan of Bali and wouldn't return."

Loads of restaurants along the beach too serving seafood- big price range there . Good for kids . The IHG lounge was a bit underwhelming, normally there’s a bit more food . The art and sculpture is amazing around the grounds . Beautiful ponds too ."

There is a great selection of pools to swim in. And the sea was on our doorstep. We also tried out a full.body massage at the spa and the treatment was excellent and very relaxing. One of the nicest things I observed is how kind, humble and hard working the staff are. They provide a professional service and always with a warm smile.All in all I have to say this is an excellent hotel to stay in. Well worth the 5 stars."

The resort is vast with 6 blocks of rooms and a large variety of restaurants. The expansive ballroom wing is fairly new and can definitely cater to any type of function or event. The face to face service points of this hotel is definitely their hidden gem here. Every single staff member that we came across from check in, restaurants, housekeeping always had a big smile on their face and looked genuinely happy to greet us. This made a huge impact on us throughout our stay. The rooms, although dated, are fairly spacious and very well maintained. Food quality in the hotel is exceptionally good. The only improvement I would say is that the signage throughout the hotel is a bit dated and unlit at night which makes it hard to see. Although the QR code map does help. Overall I would have no hesitation staying here again and recommending it to others."

Hotel area is very large, so if you don't want to walk much, request rooms nearer to the central garden. Beyond the main lobby & garden there's a cluster of very nice swimming pools, and beyond that, direct access to public beach. Hotels can't have private beach due to local regulation, but this one is deserted anyway because of it's location. Food was good. Plenty of open space to relax and enjoy the breeze. Staff are very friendly. Can't comment on the value since I was on company event. And, oh, the public toilets have warmed seats. Super nice."

Speaking of those, there are so many thoughtful design elements wherever you look in this vast resort. The food! Excellent! Had almost every meal here and they were all delicious. The breakfast buffet was as grand and varied as any I’ve ever had. The location is fine. Though not the hotel’s fault, the traffic on this island is as bad as anywhere in the world, so it takes well over a half hour to get to anywhere that’s fun. But the taxis are cheap, so bring some air pods for the rides. Loved every minute here. Thank you, All!"

"139.","M","58","2025-01-01","2","It was fine. Not amazing. For what you pay, you don't get a lot of attention to detail that you would expect from this kind of establishment. I felt that things that just should happen in a hotel, you had to request. Like a room clean everyday. Nope, you had to request it by pushing a button and if you forget, no room clean. Or replenishment of enough bottled water or clean drinking glasses, mini bar top up. Removing your in room dinning. Having your laundry delivered when they said it would be. Had to follow up multiple times. Other things like breakfast, was so hectic every morning. They couldn't manage the demand. The club pool service was low staffed. The rooms are super dated. As are the pool lounges and the surroundings. The rooms, Ok but not amazing. Bathroom too dark. Power points not close to mirror. Light switches in rooms didn't work. Air con didn't have any regulator. Well it did just never worked. They didn't replace glasses, just popped a paper lid on dirty ones. When they did in room cleaning they would turn off air con so you would come back to a hot box. The butler's are also too over the top and awkwardly wait for a tip for just coming over 10 times a day to say hello. I found that too much. I was trying to relax with my family, I don't want to tell you 8 times a day that my day is good. I also don't want to say hello 20 times a day. I don't mean to be rude, I just wanted to chill! Over all it was fine... but It lacked that Lux attention and feel. It felt dated. Finally the kids club was pretty average unless you pay extra per kid. I found that also to be a bit too much. I paid $30 for a hotel tour which was literally them putting the kids in a golf buggy and driving them around the hotel. Stay. But there are other options."
"140.","Muhammad","273","2025-01-01","5","Very calm and quiet place. A big and clean area for spending your whole day. Staying here, you don't need to go outside for any other activities. Food is so delicious, they have separate resturants for different foods, Italian restaurants, sea food, Indonesia food, Japanese etc. It takes 15 to 20 minutes to the airport in normal traffic. The garden was so nice to walk under the shadows. The swimming pool was wide enough alongside the restaurant so you can order the food or drinks."

Even if it’s a 5 Star resort lobster pasta for 40€ in Bali??? Rooms where big and comfortable but a little damp and musty also the pillows. When the air con was on it was a little better.

Also the resting hut next to the pool is amazing. You can literally feel the ocean breeze and the sound of waves is something O find extremely comforting. So many things to enjoy and quality is guaranteed. Though, when we visited, the hotel is running a minor renovation."

Di hari kedua kejadian masih sama masuk lewat main gate tetapi diarahkan ke pintu masuk karyawan dan tetap disuruh tukar id card sama security padahal saya sudah menyebut nomor kamar 4318. Ketika saya sedang tunggu family saya prepare keluar dan saya menunggu di pantai, security menghampiri saya dan menanyakan apakah bapak menginap disini ? What's wrong with you guys ? Apakah saya terlihat miskin sampai anda semua memperlakukan saya seperti itu. Apakah kalian menilai orang dari segi uang ???

"160.","Sniper Sniper","2","2022-01-14","1","Saya adalah member Spire Elite IHG (tier tertinggi membership IHG), dimana baru kali ini saya mendapatkan treatment terburuk dari semua group IHG yg pernah saya kunjungi. Saya reservasi menggunakan redeem point (reward night) IHG selama 2 malam. Tertulis jelas dalam Web IHG bahwa membership benefit yg kami dapatkan salah satunya: Priority Check In. Pertama, Check in proses hingga lebih dari 2 jam, datang pukul 3.30 sore baru bisa masuk ke room sekitar pukul 6 sore. Awaknya Setelah menunggu hampir 1 jam kami diberikan room view bagus tapi penuh debu, info dr concierge karna kamar sudah lama tidak dihuni. Apakah pantas kamar yg bau debu menyengat & debu begitu tebal di meja serta lantai diberikan kpd tamu tanpa di cek terlebih dahulu? 30 menit kemudian kami diberikan kamar transit, kami hargai untuk Bapak Assistant Manager yg datang ke room transit kami. Check in proses yg sangat lama dan begitu berbelit untuk tamu yg butuh refreshing & istirahat. Terlalu banyak alasan yg masing2 team tidak berkordinasi sehingga berdampak pd tamu. Kami request view bagus tapi infonya akan berisik dari jam 8 pagi hingga 6 sore karna ada proyek dibawah kamar kami. Akhirnya kami mendapatkan free upgrade walau dengan cara yg sangat berbelit belit. Kedua, kami diantarkan ke room oleh concierge & dibukakan pintu kamar oleh concierge. Ternyata kunci yg diberikan pd kami tidak berfungsi, sehingga ketika kami dari luar hendak masuk ke room, tidak bisa. Saya telp ke hotel, infokan bahwa saya didepan room tidak bisa masuk, key card tidak berfungsi. Total menunggu lebih dari 30 menit dan saya telp hotel hingga 3 kali baru ada petugas wanita datang. Ketiga, apapun request yg kami sampaikan selalu mendapat respon kurang baik dari Front Office. Sangat berbeda dengan pengalaman saya di group IHG lainnya. Terlebih ini adalah moment yg saya harapkan bisa jd moment berkesan tetapi yg ada perlakuan kurang baik. Semoga sisa hari kami stay disini dapat diperbaiki."

"175.","최대한","9","2025-11-14","1","Kamar yang pertama kali saya tempati berbau apek, lantainya sangat lembap hingga air menggenang, dan selimutnya juga lembap. Bak mandinya kurang dibersihkan, meninggalkan noda rambut dan karat di bak mandi. Setelah pindah ke kamar lain, kondisi kamar lebih baik dari sebelumnya, tetapi pancurannya berbau menyengat seperti kentut, mungkin karena masalah pipa ledeng. Selain itu, bantalnya juga bau, mungkin karena tidak dicuci dengan benar. Saya pernah menginap di hotel InterContinental di banyak negara, tetapi ini pertama kalinya saya melihat kamar yang tidak terawat seperti itu. Kekurangannya jauh lebih banyak daripada kelebihannya. Kelebihannya adalah kolam renang dan lanskapnya yang memukau di siang hari. Ketika saya mengeluh tentang kekurangan yang disebutkan sebelumnya, stafnya sangat membantu dan responsif. (Mereka tidak menyelesaikan masalah, tetapi mereka melakukan yang terbaik.) Jika Anda sensitif terhadap kebersihan, atau memiliki anak kecil dalam rombongan Anda, saya sarankan untuk menghindari hotel ini atau memesan kamar yang telah direnovasi. Sekadar informasi, airnya berbau sangat busuk sehingga saya check out pukul 8 pagi dan pindah ke hotel lain untuk mandi."
"176.","酒井英一郎（Eddy）","12","2025-08-14","1","Lokasi hotel ini sangat bagus. Hanya 15 menit dari bandara, 5 menit berjalan kaki ke kedai makanan laut yang terkenal, dan garis pantainya sempurna untuk jalan-jalan pagi. Di sisi lain, fasilitas dan layanannya mungkin yang terburuk. Bahkan ketika mengajukan permintaan di meja resepsionis, permintaan tersebut sering terlupakan dan jarang ditindaklanjuti. Restorannya terlalu mahal dan makanannya buruk. Pelayannya sangat kasar, terutama seorang pria muda bernama Sudiska, yang perilakunya sangat tidak sopan. Dia perlu pelatihan yang tepat. Kolam renangnya tua dan kurang bersih. Hotel ini mungkin cocok bagi mereka yang hanya peduli dengan lokasi, tetapi saya tidak akan merekomendasikannya kepada siapa pun yang menghargai layanan yang baik. Saya pernah menjadi anggota IHG Diamond tetapi memutuskan untuk keluar dari keanggotaan karena pengalaman buruk di Intercontinental Bali ini."
"177.","Dewata Journey","1","2025-10-14","1","Di acara CT Asia 2025, saya mengalami pengalaman yang sangat mengecewakan. Staf yang bertugas di pintu masuk tidak diberi tahu tentang waktu mulai yang sebenarnya atau ruang konferensi yang tepat. Beberapa mengatakan akan dimulai pukul 14.00, yang lain mengatakan ruang konferensi tidak buka, dan akhirnya, konferensi diadakan di ruangan lain di lantai atas. Ketika saya bertanya mengapa terjadi miskomunikasi seperti itu, saya mengetahui bahwa staf tersebut hanyalah pekerja harian yang tidak diberi pengarahan yang memadai oleh atasan mereka. Lebih parah lagi, staf yang saya ajak bicara memberikan informasi yang salah, yang menyebabkan kebingungan yang tidak perlu. Karena kurangnya koordinasi dan komunikasi ini, waktu saya terbuang sia-sia. Untuk acara sebesar ini, saya mengharapkan tingkat profesionalisme dan organisasi yang lebih tinggi."

"180.","Alex Klein","143","2022-01-14","1","Kecewa sampai-sampai saya mengolok-olok situasi ini untuk mengatasinya. Pertama-tama, saya ingin mengatakan bahwa ini bukan kesalahan staf, melainkan manajemen yang masih terus menjual hotel ini kepada tamu meskipun kondisinya kurang staf dan tidak terawat. Mari kita mulai dengan proses check-in. Kami memesan suite dupleks premium. Ini adalah kamar terbaik yang bisa Anda dapatkan di sini dan harganya tidak murah. AC di kamar pertama rusak sehingga kami harus menunggu beberapa jam hingga mereka mencoba memperbaikinya. Setelah upaya yang gagal, kami dipindahkan ke kamar lain. Total waktu perbaikannya setidaknya 3 jam. Suite dupleks itu sendiri sangat gelap dengan hanya satu jendela yang terhalang pohon. Anda perlu menyalakan lampu sepanjang hari agar ruangan tetap terang. Namun, beberapa orang mungkin menyukainya, jadi bagian ini netral. Hotel ini sedang dalam pembangunan besar yang berarti Anda akan mendengar suara konstruksi yang keras setiap hari. Banyak area hotel (termasuk beberapa toilet di dekat lobi) ditutup & sedang dalam pembangunan. Banyak area terlihat sangat kotor atau bahkan rusak berlubang-lubang. Saya menduga lagi karena konstruksinya. Hotel ini sangat kekurangan staf. Hal ini mengakibatkan perawatan yang buruk di berbagai aspek. Kamar mandi kami memiliki pegangan pengatur suhu yang rusak. Ada kelelawar sungguhan (ya, hewan itu) tergantung di tangga yang mengarah dari kamar ke lantai dasar. Di bawah kelelawar itu, ada kotoran bercampur darah yang menetes darinya. Saya rasa tidak ada yang menggunakan tangga di hotel 4 lantai jadi mereka tidak merawatnya? Di **beberapa** lokasi (kemungkinannya sekitar 50:50), membawa makanan luar yang kami pesan dari resepsionis ke kamar mengharuskan kami menelepon mereka beberapa kali selama lebih dari satu jam (!). Setiap kali, mereka bilang akan memeriksa dan tidak pernah menghubungi kami kembali sehingga kami harus menelepon lagi dan lagi. Tak perlu dikatakan lagi, makanannya dingin setelah satu jam duduk di resepsionis. Terkadang mereka juga hanya membawa satu makanan yang dipesan dan harus kembali untuk mencari yang kedua. Hindari memesan sarapan prasmanan - hanya nasi goreng sederhana, sereal, dan yogurt. Jangan berharap prasmanan sungguhan, ini lebih seperti versi hostel. Harganya tidak sepadan. Terakhir, meskipun semua petugas kebersihannya baik, ramah, dan sopan, sayangnya mereka semua tampaknya mengalami masalah aneh yang sama yang belum pernah kami temui di hotel lain. Sesuatu yang tidak pernah saya duga dari hotel bintang 5 merek apa pun, apalagi Intercontinental. Semua staf tidak menggunakan deodoran yang membuat kamar berbau keringat ketiak yang kuat, sehingga kami harus membukanya selama satu jam setelah mereka pergi untuk menghilangkan bau keringat seperti di pusat kebugaran. Soal bau, bantalnya juga berbau aneh. Saya tidak tahu persis apa baunya. Staf mengatakan itu berasal dari bebek yang menjadi bahan pembuat bantal. Bantal pengganti yang kami dapatkan sedikit lebih baik tetapi masih sedikit berbau. Sekali lagi, saya tidak pernah mengalami hal ini di tempat lain. Tidak yakin apa sumbernya. Saya sangat menyarankan semua orang untuk menghindari hotel ini sampai renovasi selesai dan hotel dapat mempekerjakan lebih banyak staf untuk memperbaiki masalah pemeliharaan. Pengalaman menginap di hotel yang kurang terawat seperti itu benar-benar merusak citra merek Intercontinental. Sayangnya, furnitur yang bagus (bahkan ada beberapa noda) adalah satu-satunya hal yang baik di sini."

"183.","Wid Liu","20","2023-01-14","1","Saya menulis ini karena saya masih menginap di hotel ini. 1. Pelayanannya sangat buruk meskipun semua orang sangat sopan. Meminta isi ulang kotak tisu yang kosong membutuhkan 3 kali permintaan... Sejak sebelum jam 4 sore, baru diberikan setelah jam 8 malam. 2. Kamarnya sangat berdebu. Nyamuk senang tinggal bersama saya. Obat nyamuk tidak tersedia untuk digunakan kapan saja, harus dikembalikan setelah satu kali penyemprotan. Saya kira itu sesuai dengan perilaku yang sehat. 3. Kecoa dibasmi habis-habisan oleh obat nyamuk yang ampuh dan bangkai kecoa berserakan. Sungguh memalukan. 4. Lampu kamar kami bertindak sendiri dengan bebas memutuskan kapan harus mati dan menyala.... semuanya sepenuhnya atas kemauan mereka sendiri. Kami telah meminta bantuan dua kali. Kedua kalinya saya merasa kecewa... mereka mengatakan semuanya baik-baik saja, tetapi lampu kamar saya tidak begitu ramah sampai sekarang, saat saya menulis ini. Tadi malam kami tidur tidak nyenyak. Hari ini mungkin malam kedua kami terganggu oleh lampu kamar. (jika mereka masih bersikeras bahwa semuanya sudah diperbaiki, tetapi tidak ada gunanya). Jadi saya senang kami akan check-out besok.... Saya tidak tahan dengan hotel ini. Tulisan ini bukan untuk mendapatkan keuntungan tambahan. Ini untuk memberi tahu orang lain apa yang harus diharapkan. Singkatnya, ini adalah kebersihan InterContinental dan bersiaplah untuk tidur yang mengerikan dengan lampu kamar yang berkedip-kedip sepanjang malam."

Selama bertahun-tahun, saya menginap di sini setidaknya 10 kali lagi dan selalu menyukai propertinya. Namun, kunjungan terakhir saya cukup mengecewakan. Pertama, air di kolam renang agak keruh. Meskipun ada banyak daun di beberapa kolam, setidaknya mereka harus berusaha menjaganya agar tetap berada dalam kadar air yang wajar. Hal lain yang berubah adalah sekarang mereka mengenakan biaya untuk anak-anak yang menggunakan klub anak-anak. Saya mengerti jika klub anak-anak itu luar biasa, tetapi klub anak-anak ini agak konyol. Memang properti ini sudah tua, tetapi mengenakan biaya kepada pelanggan yang menginap di kamar klub untuk klub anak-anak itu sangat tidak masuk akal. Dan mereka mengenakan biaya per JAM. Saya belum pernah menginap di hotel yang mengenakan biaya kepada tamu mereka untuk menggunakan klub anak-anak. Saat bersantai di dekat pantai, kami berpikir untuk menggunakan Bale individual di area berumput. Dan coba tebak, ada pemberitahuan yang menyatakan bahwa Bale hanya bisa digunakan oleh tamu kamar klub, yang menurut saya bagus, tapi kita juga harus membayarnya, meskipun sudah menginap di kamar klub. Ini tidak masuk akal bagi saya. Jadi, saya membayar tambahan 30% untuk mendapatkan hak membayar Bale yang kurang dimanfaatkan? (Tidak ada satu pun yang sedang digunakan saat itu). Kesabaran saya habis ketika saya tahu mereka mengenakan biaya untuk teh di dalam kamar. Hotel mana yang melakukan itu!? Tahun 2016, saya dengar hotel itu akan dijual. Saya mengerti bahwa perubahan sering terjadi ketika ada manajemen baru, tapi ini terlalu berlebihan. Menagih tamu untuk hampir semua hal kecil yang bisa dibayangkan sungguh picik dan serakah. Bikin saya penasaran, untuk apa biaya 'Biaya Resor' itu? Sepertinya kita harus membayar untuk masuk ke resor!? Saya pasti tidak akan kembali ke sini dalam waktu dekat. Dan jika Anda memiliki anak, Anda sebaiknya mempertimbangkan properti lain di area tersebut yang memiliki fasilitas lebih baik untuk Anda dan anak-anak Anda dan kemungkinan besar GRATIS."
"185.","Cherry Louwrens","4","2020-01-14","1","HATI-HATI - JANGAN PESAN!!! Kami senang berlibur ke Bali, tetapi pengalaman ini yang terburuk. Pertama, mereka menempatkan kami (keluarga beranggotakan tiga orang) di kamar twin padahal kami meminta kamar king, sangat merepotkan. Ketika saya berbicara dengan manajer jaga, dia malah menyuruh saya komplain ke agen perjalanan saya?!! Keesokan harinya, pihak hotel memutuskan untuk menagih kami sarapan, padahal sarapan sudah termasuk dalam paket. Seseorang dari bagian hubungan klien menelepon keesokan harinya, tetapi tidak bisa memberi penjelasan apa pun, padahal dia bilang akan menelepon saya kembali. Tidak pernah ada handuk di kolam renang karena terlalu banyak tamu (?!), jadi anak saya menggigil kedinginan dengan bibir biru-biru saat berjalan kembali ke kamar (>5 menit berjalan kaki, hotel besar). Ketika saya check-out, saya disuruh melunasi tagihan (>INR1,2 juta) sebelum mereka mengatur transportasi untuk saya. Sulit dipercaya mengingat ini Intercontinental, daftarnya terus bertambah. Ada jutaan hotel yang lebih baik untuk liburan Anda di Bali, jauhi Intercontinental!"
"186.","Zoey Jones","4","2022-01-14","1","Pengalaman yang buruk secara keseluruhan.. Renovasi hotel sedang ramai-ramainya. Bar menagih saya dua kali lipat harga dan menyajikan processo flat (di hari ulang tahun saya). Staf hotel menyuruh saya pergi ketika saya masuk dari pantai dengan alasan saya tidak diizinkan masuk - saya harus memberi tahu mereka beberapa kali bahwa saya menginap di sana dan dia menolak untuk mendengarkan. Dia juga mencoba mengusir anjing saya, begitu pula banyak staf lainnya yang mengira anjing saya anjing liar.. Saya juga diberitahu bahwa untuk kopi di kamar yang menggunakan mesin kopi, saya harus membayar ekstra?? Dan untuk sarapan, tidak ada selai kacang, selai kacang, dan nutella.. mereka berhasil membawa nutella tetapi ternyata isinya adalah isian kue cokelat!!! Pengalaman ini sangat buruk mengingat harganya masih tinggi! Selain itu.. deposit saya telah ditagih dari kartu kredit saya dan belum dikembalikan! Saya mengerti bahwa masa-masa ini sulit bagi seluruh dunia, kita semua telah berjuang.. tetapi semakin banyak alasan untuk benar-benar memperhatikan tamu Anda 💯 kali lebih banyak.. Pengalaman ini meninggalkan rasa tidak enak di mulut saya dan tidak akan kembali menginap di Intercon Bali."

Kami ingin membatalkan pemesanan dan hanya ingin menginap semalam. Satu-satunya pilihan adalah membayar penuh. Mereka tidak memperlakukan tamu dengan baik! Pantainya penuh sampah. Tidak ada kursi santai atau payung. Satu-satunya hal yang benar adalah hotelnya berada di pantai. Kami ingin membatalkan sisa hari, tetapi itu hanya mungkin jika kami membayar harga penuh. Sangat tidak direkomendasikan!"

Bangunannya sendiri sudah tua, dan terasa seperti hotel turis besar di Korea. Kebersihannya juga buruk. Bahkan setelah saya tiba dan meminta mereka membersihkan kamar mandi, mereka tidak memperbaikinya. Sarapannya juga kurang dibandingkan dengan hotel lain di Bali. Kesimpulan: Kamar bintang 5, bintang 3"
"189.","Charlie Jung","42","2023-01-14","1","Pengalaman terburuk yang pernah ada! Semua staf diganti dengan yang baru (mungkin magang) dan kualitas layanannya sangat buruk. Saya mencoba membayar tagihan dengan kartu kredit Korea di Sunset Cafe dan mereka tidak menerima kartu kredit bertanda tangan. Mereka terus mengatakan Kami hanya menerima kartu kredit PIN. Semua kartu Korea bertanda tangan, jadi itu artinya mereka tidak menerima pelanggan Korea. Manajer F&B datang kepada saya dan berkata, Ini peraturan kami dan Anda bisa komplain atau melapor ke GM Hotel. Saya tidak pernah menemukan layanan & sikap seperti ini di Bali atau negara lain. Saya tidak akan pernah kembali ke Intercontinental lagi."

Kami bersenang-senang setelah malam pertama di kamar ini, kami ditemani kecoak yang menjijikkan, dan yang terburuk, hotel ini sangat terisolasi sehingga terdengar suara-suara. Malam berikutnya, kali ini, kami didatangi seekor kadal setelah menelepon rumah. Seseorang sedang bergerak tetapi tidak berhasil menangkapnya karena ia berada di langit-langit palsu. Jadi, saya menghabiskan malam dengan curiga dan tiba-tiba tidur sangat buruk. Selama 4 hari, seprai tidak diganti sama sekali. Alasan yang saya lihat adalah suami saya mengalami cedera bahu. Jadi, setiap malam dia mengoleskan krim Voltarene yang sangat kuat. Ketika kami kembali dari pantai, tempat tidurnya memang sudah selesai, tetapi seprai masih terasa sangat buruk karena seprai tidak diganti. Staf hotel sangat ramah, tidak ada yang istimewa, restoran di dalam hotel tidak menyediakan minuman dan Coca-Cola seharga 4 euro, bagaimana bisa dikatakan lebih mahal daripada di Prancis! Pantainya tidak bagus, juga tidak banyak ombak. Saya kurang merekomendasikan area pantai Nusa Dua yang tenang dan bebas ombak. Untuk menikmati ikan segar yang lezat, Jimbaran tetap wajib dikunjungi. Sekilas, hotel ini luar biasa. Sambutan hangat menanti Anda, dan kamarnya cukup bagus, cukup luas, dan bersih. Kami kecewa setelah malam pertama menginap di kamar ini; kami ditemani seekor kecoa, yang sangat menjijikkan. Isolasi hotelnya buruk, jadi kami bisa mendengar suara-suara. Namun, malam berikutnya, kami didatangi seekor kadal. Setelah menghubungi resepsionis, seseorang datang ke meja resepsionis tetapi tidak dapat menangkapnya karena tersangkut di celah langit-langit, jadi saya berjaga semalaman dan tidurnya sangat buruk. Selama 4 hari, seprai belum pernah diganti sekali pun. Saya bisa menduga penyebabnya adalah bahu pasangan saya yang sakit, jadi setiap malam dia mengoleskan krim yang sangat kuat seperti Voltarene. Sekembalinya kami dari pantai, tempat tidurnya memang sudah dirapikan, tetapi seprainya masih bau, jadi seprai tidak diganti. Staf hotelnya luar biasa. Tidak ada yang perlu dikeluhkan. Restoran di dalam hotel terlalu mahal, dan Coca-Cola-nya 4 euro, lebih mahal daripada di Prancis! Pantainya juga tidak bagus, banyak ombaknya. Saya merekomendasikan kawasan Nusa Dua, yang lebih tenang dan bebas ombak. Untuk ikan segar yang enak, Jimbaran wajib dikunjungi."

Anda dapat melihat dengan jelas perbedaan layanan pelanggan di sini."

Bahkan belum empat hari setelah badai... jadi saya mencari hotel lain."
"193.","S J","4","2019-01-14","1","Taman dan pantainya sangat indah dan indah. Saya sudah menginap di sini beberapa kali, hanya untuk bersantai seharian. Yang paling buruk adalah penerimaan tamu yang sangat buruk dan stafnya sedikit. Pada tanggal 4 Februari, pukul 11.30 pagi, ada dua resepsionis di meja depan dan staf wanita menanyakan pembayaran untuk putri saya yang berusia 5 tahun, meskipun mereka tidak mengenakan biaya untuk anak di bawah 12 tahun dengan tiket harian baru (300.000 rupiah). Kedua resepsionis itu mencoba mencari dokumen mereka di depan kami. Saya merasa mereka hanya mencoba menagih saya lebih banyak karena staf wanita itu tidak meminta maaf atau bersikap seperti itu. Saya tidak peduli dengan pemberitahuan impor darinya karena saya pernah menginap di sini dan saya adalah anggota SPG, tetapi dia hanya memberi saya struk belanja seperti supermarket tanpa menyebutkan apa pun. Ada sesuatu yang sangat mengganggu saya di depan pantai. Ketika saya membaca di menara mereka, akhirnya saya mendapat permintaan lagi. Itu hanya untuk tagihan tambahan mereka, meskipun saya sudah memberikan salah satunya ketika saya mendapatkan menara. Saya bilang padanya, dia bisa mengajukan permintaan ke resepsionis, bukan ke saya. Memang agak merepotkan dengan tiket harian, tetapi semua layanan di tepi kolam renang tetap bagus seperti biasa."

Saya sudah bertanya kepada manajemen berapa lama waktu yang dibutuhkan, tetapi mereka tidak bisa menjawab. Pukul 09.00 pagi, istri saya bertanya lagi, tetapi tidak ada jawaban. Kemudian pukul 12.00 siang, kami mengetahui banyak tamu yang sudah pindah. Dan kemudian kami ditawari untuk pindah hotel. Sebagai anggota IHG, saya merasa kecewa dengan cara mereka melayani tamu."

"201.","Snow Wu","114","2020-01-14","1","Perhatikan kebijakan pembatalan dan dendanya. Untuk voucher menginap gratis di akhir pekan Ambassodor, kebijakan pembatalan gratis hotel ini berlaku satu bulan sebelum pemesanan. Oleh karena itu, pastikan tidak ada hal yang tidak diinginkan yang memaksa Anda untuk membatalkan pemesanan dalam waktu satu bulan, atau dendanya akan tinggi dan tidak ada kemungkinan pengembalian uang. Banyak hotel dengan harga yang sama lebih baik dari hotel ini. 1 bintang untuk kerugian saya sebesar 6,3 juta IND (448 USD). Kebijakan menginap gratis di Ambassador ini berbeda dengan hotel InterContinental lainnya. Anda harus membatalkan satu bulan sebelumnya secara gratis. Hotel lain menawarkan pembatalan gratis 48 jam sebelumnya, tetapi hotel ini mengharuskan kami untuk mengonfirmasi bahwa tidak akan ada keadaan tak terduga sebulan sebelumnya, jika tidak, denda pembatalan akan dikenakan pada tarif kamar malam pertama, yang tidak dapat dinegosiasikan. Dengan harga yang sama, Anda dapat menemukan pilihan yang lebih baik di Bali. Karena kerugian sebesar 448 USD (6,3 juta rupiah), saya memberikannya 1 bintang."

Kebersihan kamar teratur, namun telepon berbau asap saat digunakan untuk menelepon. Mereka mungkin lupa membersihkan gagang telepon. Kekurangan: Makanan di hotel bintang 3 acak di Kuta jauh lebih baik daripada makanan mereka. Saya keracunan makanan dan muntah hebat setelah sarapan. Saya menduga itu karena nasi lama yang mereka simpan di lemari es dan disajikan berulang kali. Nasi kering dan basi. Putri saya keracunan makanan karena susu. Sebagian besar pilihan makanan tidak segar, mungkin disiapkan sehari sebelumnya untuk melayani banyak tamu. Kami mencoba makan malam dan kasusnya sama, Anda akan mengharapkan makanan berkualitas dari resor mewah seperti itu, namun mereka menyajikan makanan dingin tanpa rasa garam. Pelayanan di pusat aktivitas dekat kolam renang sangat kasar. Mereka mengira kami hanya menginap 1 malam karena saya bukan orang asing, padahal kami menginap 9 malam. Seorang pria lain juga membuat komentar kasar dalam bahasa Bali yang menyatakan bahwa tamu non-kulit putih hanyalah beban ketika saya mengambil handuk. Saya orang Bali dan mengerti komentar tersebut, namun saya tidak menegur mereka tetapi benar-benar kesal dengan komentar tersebut. Mereka tersenyum dan bersikap sopan di depan, tetapi melontarkan komentar sinis di belakang dalam bahasa Bali. Liburan saya jadi berantakan karena merasa diperlakukan seperti beban.

Menghapus layanan makan di kamar Anda. Mendapat cucian Anda diantar pada waktu yang mereka janjikan. Harus menindaklanjuti beberapa kali. Hal-hal lain seperti sarapan, sangat sibuk setiap pagi. Mereka tidak dapat memenuhi permintaan. Layanan kolam renang klub kekurangan staf. Kamar-kamarnya sangat kuno. Begitu pula lounge kolam renang dan sekitarnya. Kamar-kamarnya, lumayan tapi tidak luar biasa. Kamar mandi terlalu gelap. Stopkontak listrik tidak dekat dengan cermin. Sakelar lampu di kamar tidak berfungsi. AC tidak memiliki regulator. Yah, memang tidak pernah berfungsi. Mereka tidak mengganti gelas, hanya memasang tutup kertas pada gelas yang kotor. Ketika mereka membersihkan kamar, mereka akan mematikan AC sehingga Anda akan kembali ke kotak panas. Pelayannya juga terlalu berlebihan dan dengan canggung menunggu tip hanya untuk datang 10 kali sehari untuk menyapa. Saya merasa itu terlalu berlebihan. Saya mencoba bersantai dengan keluarga saya, saya tidak ingin memberi tahu Anda 8 kali sehari bahwa hari saya baik. Saya juga tidak ingin menyapa 20 kali sehari. Saya tidak bermaksud kasar, saya hanya ingin bersantai! Secara keseluruhan, itu baik-baik saja... tetapi kurang perhatian dan nuansa mewah. Terasa kuno. Terakhir, klub anak-anak cukup rata-rata kecuali jika Anda membayar ekstra per anak. Saya merasa itu juga agak terlalu mahal.
