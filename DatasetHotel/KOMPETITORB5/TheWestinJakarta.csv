"1.","Pare Roocheepaht","78","2025-12-01","5","The Westin Jakarta (Corner Room Experience) The Westin Jakarta offers an elevated experience—quite literally—as it occupies the top floors of the towering Gama Tower, providing one of the most breathtaking perspectives of the city. It's a true five-star haven combining luxury, wellness, and a spectacular location in the heart of Jakarta's Golden Triangle business district. Hotel Highlights and Amenities • Location: Situated strategically in the Setiabudi district, offering excellent access to the main business and commercial areas. • Dining at Henshin: A mandatory visit. Located on the top floors (67th-69th), this Nikkei (Japanese-Peruvian) restaurant and rooftop bar offers spectacular 360-degree views and world-class fine dining and cocktails. • Wellness Facilities: The hotel is strongly focused on wellness, featuring a beautiful indoor swimming pool, a massive, well-equipped 24-hour gym (often located on a high floor for views), and a full-service spa. • Westin Club Lounge: Available for guests in Club and Suite categories. It offers complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea, and evening cocktails in a sophisticated setting with great views. • Service: The staff are consistently praised for being warm, professional, and attentive, upholding excellent Indonesian hospitality standards. Verdict: The Westin Jakarta delivers an outstanding, modern, and memorable luxury experience. The Corner Room is highly recommended for any special occasion or business trip where you want a truly expansive, memorable, and relaxing space above the hustle and bustle of the city. While the hotel is popular and can be busy (especially the high-floor dining outlets), the peace, comfort, and view from your private corner sanctuary make it an unforgettable stay."

They have various welcome drinks and also free popcorn at the main lobby (though you need to ask for it). The room is clean and have a lot of open space. The window curtain is automated and so does the bath curtain. The TV is already a smart TV so you can easily browse using your YouTube account and watch your favorite YouTuber. Breakfast options have a really wide range of varieties. During my time of stay they offer Indonesians, Indian, Korean, Western and many more."

"7.","Didit A Irwantoko","456","2025-12-01","5","Salah satu hal yang menyenangkan di hotel ini adalah keramahan pelayanannya. Namun sayang posisinya di jantung kemacetan Rasuna Said sehingga harus sabar melihat jam yg tidak macet kalau mau turun ke jalan antara siangan atau sekalian malam lepas 2100. Lobby nya ada di lantai bawah yg harus naik dulu dan ada Room Club Kopi serta Special di 52 dan 65. WiFi nya juga gak lake ribets. Cuman sign mana mau ke mana yang kurang eye cathing misal pintu keluar/masuk, toilet male/female. Well bisa dibetulin lebih baiks 🫡👍"

"9.","Trent Prestegar","114","2025-11-01","5","Great 5 star hotel. Rooms are large and have a great view of Jakarta. Staff are all extremely friendly and professional. Pool, hot tub and sauna onsite. Great breakfast with wide variety of western, Indonesian, Korean, indian, and sweets. Location is good the only thing is traffic on the road outside can be bad especially if you need to U-turn from the other side of the main road. Lobby is on the 52ns floor and rooms above that so can be a bit tedious having to go up/down two sets of elevators to go out but worth it for the views."
"10.","Widia Hartono","88","2025-12-01","5","Datang ke The Westin Jakarta untuk menghadiri meeting asosiasi (APLI) di lantai 1, ruang Medan. Area parkir cukup luas dan mudah diakses, dengan lift yang nyaman dan modern. Ruang meetingnya berkualitas tinggi — sangat cocok untuk acara formal seperti rapat atau seminar. Makanan yang disajikan juga cukup enak dan berstandar hotel bintang lima. Secara keseluruhan, The Westin Jakarta memberikan pengalaman meeting yang profesional dan berkelas. 👍✨"

"12.","Nick Choi","88","2025-09-01","5","This Marriott property has become the hotel I visit most often while living in Jakarta. The rooms are spacious, the service is excellent, and surprisingly, the price is very reasonable. For around idr 2 million, staying at a hotel of this standard is truly a great deal. The Seasonal buffet restaurant is also worth trying. It’s about idr 700k with tax? Maybe... per person, and not only is the food quite good, but it also comes with freeflow beer. After dinner, heading up to the rooftop bar Henshin to enjoy Jakarta’s night view outdoors is always a highlight. One of my favorite touches is the in-room aroma amenity. Before bed, put a little on your pillow and lie down—the soothing scent makes for such a relaxing and restful night. With its balance of price, service, and atmosphere, it’s easy to see why this hotel is my go-to in Jakarta."

"21.","ramdhan febri","132","2025-08-01","5","Salah satu hotel yang menyajikan pemandangan dari ketinggian jakarta Lobynya saja terletak di lantai 52. Gedung hotel ini menjadi 1 dengan kantor di satu gedung yang sama. Fasilitas hotelnya lengkap, dari gym dengan alat yang cukup oke, kolam renang walaupun tidak luas dengan kedalaman yg aman buat anak anak (1,3 meter) dan ada spa juga Kesan awal menginap hotel ini cukup unik, makanan nya enak enak. Semuanya sangat cocok dilidah. Kamanya pun luas, moderen, bersih dan menenangkan (mungkin karena ada diketinggian jadi tidak ada suara bising dari jalan). Hotelnya juga dekat dengan mall dan pusat olahraga jadi akses cukup oke juga. Untuk parkiran hanya menyediakan parkir mobil."
"22.","Sarah Yang","23","2025-08-01","5","The room was upgraded and we were provided with a special check-in service right in the room.

"32.","Agnes P Sugianto","22","2025-08-01","5","Yesterday we stayed at The Westin for a short staycation with my husband and child, and it was a wonderful experience (a special occasion for us). The club room was thoughtfully decorated, esp. the mirror and towel art, it was a heartfelt feeling as we entered the room. I was also so surprised when the staffs knocked to our room, sang happy birthday, and brought a surprise cake! Not to mention the city view was beautiful at night. Later at the dinner buffet at Seasonal Taste, we were surprised again with another cake and singing. The rotisserie chicken at the buffet was especially delicious! Breakfast was also great, and I really appreciated the manager coming to our table to check on our stay. It felt very kind and genuine. Sari, our PIC and her team truly did an amazing job. On Sunday, my child joined the nail art activity hosted by Samantha, and Salsabila kindly kept her entertained while I stepped out for a bit. I came back to find her giggling and having a great time. Overall, the stay really exceeded our expectations. We felt happy, relaxed, and very well cared for. Will come back for sure."

I booked two rooms for myself, my husband, my mom, and my brother. To my surprise, the team upgraded our room to a beautiful Junior Suite, which was such a lovely gesture and made our stay even more special. The surprises didn’t stop there! During our afternoon tea at the Westin Club Lounge, I received another thoughtful surprise that made me feel truly appreciated and celebrated. A big thank you to Yolanda and the entire Westin team for making my birthday so unforgettable. I felt incredibly happy and well taken care of throughout the stay. I will definitely come back to celebrate more special moments in the future. Highly recommended!"

The rooms are big, very clean, and have a super comfortable bed and a large TV. You can hear a little street noise, but it’s not a big deal.

Makanan yg disuguhkan utk dinner sangatlah istimewa, 1. soupnya masih panas, enak, dgn topping yg banyak, menyegarkan di perut anget2. 2. The steak so tender, sangat mudah dipotong, tidak perlu banyak effort ketika digigit, dipadu dengan saus blackpepper yg tidak menyengat namun memberikan taste yg 👍👍 3. The Lobster WOW!! fresh, so juicy, and perfectly cooked! 4. Fried rice tipe nasi goreng chinese/hongkong yg tidak memakai kecap manis, diberikan irisan sayur kecil2 dan diberi potongan daging bebek, hmm yummy! 5. The dessert so beautiful, mau motong dan makannya aja kayak sayang bener. Rasanya enak sekali, rasa jeruk bercampur white chocolate, dengan rasa yang tidak terlalu manis! All the dishes tasted so gooddd, Keep.up the good work 💪💪"

"74.","Choi Jia","27","2025-04-01","5","Really impressed with the cleanliness of the room. Even compared to other 5 stars hotel i would say The Westin sets the bar high. No mouldy sealants in the bathroom, i noticed the trash bins are quite large, it's a plus point for me because i always think hotel trash bins are too small. We always ended up using paper bag to dispose things. Breakfast was ok but need more variations of menu. We also visited the bar at 67th floor, and enjoyed the experience. Staff was great and attentive. Having said that, the check in procedure was too long. Overall it was a great stay ❤️"

Karyawan ga ramah ga sopan judes semua dari satpam dipintu masuk pejalan kaki, cleaning service di wc wanita, sampai waitress diruang makan lantai 1 terutama waitressnya yg paling parah judes ketus ga sopan ngegas ngomongnya. Sbg dokter, sy sdh sangat sering simposium dihotel bintang 5 tp cuma di hotel ini sy tdk diperlakukan seperti dokter. Apa karyawan2 hotel tsb tdk tahu klo ada acara dokter di tgl 24 mei itu ? Knp karyawan hotel lain bisa profesional tapi hotel tsb tdk ? Baru kali ini sy dikecewakan oleh 5 star hotel"

Nyatanya tidak sama sekali, check in pk14:14, kamar belum siap, ok kita tunggu di lounge sampai pk 16:00 kamar baru siap, kami harus datang ke front desk berkali² untuk pastikan kamar kami siap. Saat masuk kamar tidak sesuai notes kami, request twin disediakan king, extra bed belum terpasang, sangat tidak baik tamu sudah didalam, minta extra bed saat reservasi, tapi baru set up saat tamu sudah didalam kamar. Suami put notes bahwa kami anniversary dan membawa anak². Nyatanya hanya dikasih tulisan ucapan di cermin, oke thank you. Akhirnya suami datang lagi ke front desk untuk memastikan tipe kamar, dan kita dipindahkan ke twin, tapi kamar masih belum siap, tamu baru check out, jam berapa itu sudah pk17. Akhirnya kita pergi makan dulu, dan suami baru ditelpon westin pk19 menginfokan bahwa kamar ready. Masuk kamar, apakah ada compliment anniversary atau mungkin untuk kids? Tidak ada juga. Baik gpp mungkin lupaa atau sistem error. Yah begitulah kesan pertama kami menginap di hotel ini."
"89.","Vitamin C","79","2025-06-01","5","We asked for a sunny room, but it didn't get as much light as I thought it would, and felt cold especially at night. When we told the manager that our room was too cold, she changed the room right away, and we were very grateful for that. I'm intolerant to milk and dairy, so the only thing I can eat in the dinner lounge was salad because of the buttery & dairy in the dishes. And plus it was a shame that they ran out of tempeh snacks. Anyway, the food at the breakfast restaurant was generally good, but the Korean food was too sweet & oily. The German bread pretzel was a bit disappointing because the crust wasn't supposed to be covered with butter, but it should be covered with only salt."
"90.","Jonson Li","57","2025-06-01","5","The Westin Jakarta is basically my second home in Jakarta. The room, service, and staff are the best.

It's definitely a 5-star hotel with 5-star service."
"91.","Kim Jason","1","2025-03-01","1","I have stayed at this hotel twice, but my most recent experience was an absolute nightmare. Due to a severe bacterial infection, I was completely unable to enjoy any of the hotel's services. While suffering from a high fever, splitting headache, and relentless vomiting, the hotel management was more focused on denying responsibility than providing any real assistance. The only food I had that day was a sandwich from the lounge, and just an hour later, I was hit with intense sickness. Despite this clear connection, the hotel refused to acknowledge any fault. To make matters worse, I had to cover all medical expenses out of my own pocket, including the doctor and medication. Instead of showing concern for my well-being, the management prioritized protecting themselves over providing proper hospitality. Their indifference and lack of accountability made an already terrible situation even worse. For those considering a stay at this hotel, I strongly urge you to think twice. There are plenty of other options in Jakarta that actually care about their guests' health and safety. Avoid this place at all cost."

Berada di salah satu hotel tertinggi di Indonesia, suasananya mewah dan memukau sejak pertama kali masuk. Interiornya elegan, pelayanannya nomor satu, dan kenyamanannya juara! Bagian yang paling berkesan? Buffet-nya! The Westin menyajikan berbagai pilihan menu, dari hidangan Western hingga masakan tradisional Indonesia, semua disajikan dengan presentasi estetik dan cita rasa bintang lima. Mau steak premium hingga desert, semua ada, dan semuanya ruarr biasa 😊 Makan malam sambil menikmati pemandangan Jakarta dari ketinggian tentu bikin suasana farewell party jadi lebih spesial. Secara keseluruhan, senang banget bisa menikmati momen berharga di tempat sekeren ini. Highly recommended! 👍🏻👍🏻"
"93.","Sasha Pratiwi","6","2025-04-01","1","Setiap melewati Westin, ada rasa jengkel yang tersisa. Sekitar 1 tahun yang lalu, saya ada meeting dengan client di Café/ loungenya. Security menegur saya dengan kasar karena masuk pintu keluar bukan pintu masuk (ingat pak, bapak kerja di perhotelan, bukan pabrik). Disana saya bertemu pegawai Westin yang sepertinya karyawan baru karena bingung menjawab dimana Café/loungenya. Ketika saya naik ke tujuan, salah satu waiter memberikan tatapan sinis kepada saya karena saya bertanya “apakah bisa duduk di Cafe/lounge untuk menunggu client saya” lalu dia jawab “duduk disitu aja ya Bu yang belum diberesin”, iya saya diberikan meja bekas pengunjung lain. Karena saya kesal, akhirnya saya memutari Cafe/lounge untuk mencari tempat yang nyaman untuk meeting dengan client. Hingga saya akan masuk ke tempat yang sepertinya ruang meeting (?) atau ruang vvip (?) idk. Tapi ketika saya menuju kesana, waiter sinis arogan itu memanggil saya seperti ayam “huss sstt husss jangan kesana, mau kemana? Gak bisa sembarangan kesana ya” Iya saya sedih karena direndahkan. Mungkin penampilan saya tidak pantas untuk datang ke tempat ini? Untungnya client saya hadir dan meminta saya untuk naik tangga sekali karena dia sudah sampai sana. Untuk waitress di tempat ini (sepertinya lounge) sangat baik karena aktif memberikan rekomendasi fnb untuk saya. Saya harap waiter sinis dan arogan itu bisa membaca postingan ini, jangan suka merendahkan orang karena belum tentu orang yang kamu rendahkan sesuai pemikiran kamu."

Saya hanya menggunakan ruang rapat Medan 2 6di Lantai 1, namun dr kesan yg saya dapatkan, bahwa hotel Westin ini sangat mewah. Apalagi saat menikmati makan siang, ruaar biasa...berbagi menu makanan (western maupun Indonesia) dan minuman tersaji dengan melimpah. Pun demikian dengan hidangan pencuci mulutnya, tersedia dr buah sampai dengan ice cream. Dengan lokasi tempat di lantai 51, meja kursi yg sangat nyaman, menambah betah berlama-lama di ruang makan tersebut. Yg berbeda dgn hotel lain yg saya kunjungi, waitressnya hanya mengambil piring mangkuk saja, tanpa mengambil sendok garpunya, sungguh satu pengertian yg amat sangat baik. Saya membayangkan, alangkah mewahnya apabila masuk kamar tidurnya. Namun saya hanya sebagai peserta rapat dari kegiatan yg half day meeting, sehingga hanya bisa membayangkan saja. Hotel Westin memang OKS."

My family and I have been treated exceptionally well at the Westin Jakarta, surpassing all of my expectations. I’ve experienced many 5-star hotels around the world, but the warm welcome here sets it apart. My wife particularly loved the club lounge and the room cleanliness where she enjoyed delightful conversations with the friendly staffs; especially Siti.

Dari lantai 1 kemudian langsung naik ke lantai 52 yang dimana lantai itu adalah sky lobby. Untuk lantai 50 itu ada pool, gym, and spa. Di lantai 51 baru ada resto. Untuk restonya sendiri cukup luas dan banyak menu yang beragam. Jadi bisa makan dengan suasana langit di sekitar. pelayanannya juga sangat ramah. Untuk kamarnya sendiri cukup wow ya sekali. Menambah experience saya kesini. Dimana ada bathub nya dan ada meja untuk bekerja. Pengalaman saya disini cukup berkesan sekali dan saya harap saya bisa kembali kesini nanti."
"133.","Richard","69","2025-01-01","1","Some of your security needs training on basic manner and respect. I recently visited the Westin Jakarta and was deeply disappointed with the service I received at the entrance while on a motorcycle. I mistakenly approached the wrong gate. Instead of being guided politely I was shouted at unprofessionally by the staff, causing me a great deal of embarrassment. This is unacceptable behavior, especially from a supposedly ‘luxury’ hotel. It’s important to note that it’s not the visitors fault if the signage isn’t clear – the hotel should ensure that signs are visible and easy to follow for all guests. This experience was not at all reflective of the hospitality I expected from a hotel of this caliber. It was appalling and left me completely disgusted. and to top it off, their response was downright humiliating. Westin Jakarta needs to train its staff on basic manners and respect. This level of unprofessionalism is disgraceful. Hospitality should be about making every guest feel welcome, not belittled. *Props to the security on the pedestrian gate. He did receive my complaint very well and actually apologized about it. If the management wants to check the footage : Friday, December 6th 2024 Around 7:07 PM"

"135.","강주영","107","2025-01-01","1","I usually prefer moving around and staying at different hotels rather than sticking to just one, as I enjoy comparing experiences. Last week, I stayed at another hotel for seven days, which offered warm hospitality for Bonvoy members and excellent facilities—it was perfect. Today, I moved to the Sheraton Gandaria Hotel, but honestly, I’ve been a bit disappointed. I set the room temperature to 22~23°C, but the musty smell and humidity make it uncomfortable. If I lower the temperature below 21°C, the smell and humidity go away, but it feels too cold for a good night’s sleep. I wonder if it’s just the room we’re in? The staff here are more focused on formal service than offering warm hospitality. If I return to Jakarta, I’ll likely skip this place. Friend, if you ask me, I’d recommend staying somewhere else. If you’re a Bonvoy member, there are better hotels that provide a much warmer welcome."

Ini hotel tertinggi yang pernah sy kunjungi..karena ini hotel bisnis jd hiburan untuk anak kurang dan hotelnya 1 gedung dgn perkantoran jd awal2 agak bingung aksesnya kalau tidak tanya krn hrs ganti2 lift. Tapi fasilitas utk org dewasa lengkap, kamar cukup besar, kamar mandi besar dan bagus, ad bath up serta amenities yg lengkap. Staffnya juga ramah, makanan cukup enak."
"164.","kramotakra","31","2025-01-01","5","I had the utmost pleasant stay at this luxury hotel. I was privileged to spend several days in the executive suite at 63rd floor. You can pretty much see entire Jakarta! The breakfast was solid with amazing variety as was the lounge. But what I found truly amazing was the service. The staffer were trained well. They call you by honorific and name, and know your seating and coffee preferences by second day. They strive to make your stay as delightful as possible. I thought it was rather creative to put the staffers passion and hobby right under their names. Definitely make them more personable. I want to highlight the chef who gave me custom order salmon slices, Eka who got me the late checkout, the adorable Shania of Tangerang who gave me travel tips, and gorgeous 🥰 Elvina of Medan who made me the most amazing Bailey's - Kahlua - Expresso cocktail! Delish!! Lovely smiles, lovely ladies. I was sad to leave 🥲"

"166.","Neutz","273","2025-01-01","5","Saya baru-baru ini mengalami makan malam yang luar biasa di The Westin Jakarta, dan saya tidak sabar untuk berbagi pengalaman saya yang luar biasa. Hotel ini tidak hanya menawarkan akomodasi mewah, tetapi juga menyajikan pengalaman kuliner yang tak tertandingi, terutama di restoran mereka yang menawarkan hidangan buffet yang sangat mengesankan. Menu buffet di The Westin Jakarta sungguh luar biasa. Pilihan makanan yang sangat beragam dan lengkap, memastikan bahwa setiap tamu dapat menemukan sesuatu yang memuaskan selera mereka. Mulai dari hidangan lokal autentik hingga hidangan internasional yang lezat, menu ini benar-benar memanjakan lidah dan menciptakan petualangan kuliner yang tak terlupakan. Varietas hidangan pembuka, hidangan utama, hingga hidangan penutupnya sangat mengesankan. Saya merasakan kecermatan dalam penyajian dan kreativitas dalam setiap hidangan. Baik Anda pencinta daging, penggemar hidangan laut, atau vegetarian, The Westin Jakarta menawarkan pilihan yang memuaskan semua selera. Keistimewaan dari suasana di restoran ini juga patut diacungi jempol. Pemandangan kota Jakarta yang spektakuler dari lantai tinggi menambah nilai artistik dan romantis pada pengalaman makan malam. Suasana yang tenang dan mewah menciptakan setting yang sempurna untuk makan malam bersama keluarga, teman, atau pasangan. Yang membuat pengalaman ini semakin mengesankan adalah pelayanan yang sangat ramah dan profesional dari seluruh staf. Mereka tidak hanya membantu dan informatif, tetapi juga memberikan sentuhan personal dalam setiap interaksi. Kehadiran mereka yang sigap dan responsif meningkatkan kenyamanan dan kepuasan tamu. Saya juga ingin menyoroti ketersediaan koktail dan minuman berkualitas tinggi di sini. Bartender yang terampil menciptakan minuman kreatif dan menyegarkan, yang menjadi pelengkap sempurna untuk hidangan lezat yang disajikan. Ini menambah dimensi baru pada pengalaman bersantap dan memperkaya seluruh pengalaman di The Westin Jakarta. Sebagai kesimpulan, saya dengan tulus merekomendasikan The Westin Jakarta kepada siapa pun yang mencari pengalaman kuliner yang istimewa di Jakarta. Dari pilihan makanan yang luas hingga pemandangan kota yang menakjubkan, semuanya menciptakan suasana yang tidak dapat dilupakan. Ini bukan sekadar makan malam, melainkan perjalanan kuliner yang memukau dan membuat setiap kunjungan layak diingat. Saya yakin bahwa setiap tamu akan meninggalkan The Westin Jakarta dengan kenangan indah dan kepuasan yang mendalam."

Fresh coffee did really make our day! Croissant was crispy outside and chewy layered on the inside. Their Pastry Chef did a very good job!

Bosen dgn suasana hotel bs ngopi di cafe/mall terdekat. 2. Kamar. Kalau ada bintang 7 sy kasih bintang 7. Kasurnya bnr2 empuk, nyaman. Meja & kursi kerja top class quality. Kalau pas jenuh bs terobati liat view malam Jakarta. Ada bathub yg sangat nyaman, cocok buat yg mau bawa anak2. Dan satu yg ngebuat sy sgt suka sm hotel ini, kualitas TV 55inchi 4K nya dan suguhan tontonannya amazing lah, betah bgt buat mager2an di kamar. 3. Makanan? selama tiga hari disini, sy rasa tdk ada perbedaan signifikan di variasinya, karena emang banyak juga. Japanese, Western, Indonesia Traditional, India, Chinese lengkap. Sushi sashimi is good. Indian food OK. Western food is amazing. But, Indonesia traditional food need more improvement. Potongan tempe di oreg tempe perlu lebih kecil, karena cita rasanya yg manis. Ayam geprek kurang krispi, sambal bawang masih kurang nendang, perlu sedikit lebih seasoning. Kuah bakso juga butuh lebih gurih lg. Overall utk Indonesian traditional food masih kalah enak dibanding westernnya. Oiya, the cheesy omlete that i ordered yesterday was just perfect!! 4. Overall, sy pengen kasih bintang 6 atau 7. Karena servis yang luar biasa. Tapi gugle cuma bisa kasih 5. Thank you Westin."

With respect to the morning meal, I love the bagel soo much! The Mac and cheese moreover!! Also, attempted myself to try different yogurt, blended in with nuts, real fruits. Services is the first. They helped me whenever needed. Nonetheless, I hope they'll provide meals like Fish&Chips or pudding in the future!"

The gym does get quite crowded in the morning, but clean & no issue. Love the sauna & vitality pool too. Best enjoyed after gym session. There wasn’t too many options for drinks during the night at the club lounge. Few local beers, one option of white & red wine each + gin tonic. Yet again, the city view is unbeatable. Breakfast was great. The wonton soup was especially delightful. The croissants are excellent too. Their options of 4-5 honey are great. Thank you Westin. It’s been delightful."

You can find anything you wanna eat here (both breakfast and dinner).

This is quite annoying for me."

Must try their restaurant, the food is really good and they have excellent desserts. All in all, it’s a very good place to stay or just having a meal. The traffic outside is pretty bad tho since it’s located in Kuningan area."

"192.","Adhi Rachdian","244","2020-01-01","4","Kami menginap dari hari-1 hari Raya Idul Fitri 2019 hingga besok (ketika review ini dibuat kami masih menginap) di 3 kamar. Promo paket menginap dihari libur ini ternyata sangat menyenangkan, “best buy!”. Harga terbaik dengan layanan prima. Pengalaman menginap disini bisa jadi bahan rekomendasi untuk calon tamu westin lainnya. Fasilitas yang lengkap sesuai dengan predikatnya sebagai hotel berbintang. Salah satu yang terbaik di hotel ini adalah makanan pagi (buffet)nya termasuk terbaik dibanding dibanding hotel2 lainnya. Varian menu yang lengkap, penyajian yang keren, rasa yang istimewa untuk semua jenis makanan yang saya coba. Mulai dari makanan indonesia hingga makanan internasional seperti “beef bacon” hingga aneka cita rasa minuman jus. Sehingga ketika tiap pagi makan disini ber-turut2pun tetap belum bosan dengan menu (yang dikebanyakan hotel2 lainnya adalah itu2 saja). Pemandangannya yang istimewa yang bisa melihat keindahan kota Jakarta menjadi daya tarik tersendiri mengingat restorannya menempati lantai 51. Fasilitas lainnya juga sangat lengkap termasuk fasilitas olahraga, mulai dari gym, sauna, “whirlpool” hingga kolam renang. Khusus bagi pecinta olahraga renang, memang kolam renangnya sedikit mengecewakan karena kolamnya “indoor” dan tidak luas / panjang, walaupun cukup memuaskan karena kita bisa menggunakan fasilitas ini hingga pukul 23.00. Diantara kelebihan lain dari hotel ini juga adalah sensasi pemandangannya karena saat ini hotel ini merupakan hotel tertinggi di Jakarta (Indonesia) karena kamar2nya menempati lantai 52 hingga 69. Kamarnya pun menyenangkan dengan luas yang cukup memadai"

Lalu pas di lobi, kita dicek suhu kembali. Lalu ada check in aplikasi peduli lindungi namun tidak wajib (diinfokan oleh securitynya). Fasilitas seperti gym dan kolam renang dibatasi jumlah orangnya. Kita harus booking jadwal melalui operator. Saran, booking kolam renang pas jam buka kolam saja yaitu pukul 7 pagi, sepi banget. Sauna dan vitality pool tidak beroperasi sama sekali. Heavenly spa juga tidak beroperasi. Sudah bisa breakfast dilantai 51 dengan waktu 1 jam saja. Para staff menggunakan masker dan sarung tangan. Restoran Hensin juga sudah bisa dine in namun harus booking terlebih dahulu. Kebetulan saya menginap untuk wedding anniversary dan ternyata diberi kue juga sama pihak westinnya 😆 Untuk yang membawa anak, baiknya mencari kamar yang ada bathtub, biar puas maen air. Soalnya kita hanya bisa berenang selama 1 jam saja. Semua staff ramah banget. Kaget juga ketemu beberapa staff yang mengingat nama saya. Terima kasih."

"197.","John James","153","2025-01-01","5","Not sure where to start. First off, coming from the United States, I have never experienced this level of hospitality. To stay the staff at the Westin are friendly, accommodating, and professional is just not enough. For example, I dinned by myself one night after having back issues and had a night in. The Dinning room manager Tonny Christiano, personally came over and offered to show me around. After he explained the entire offerings of the buffet, I was awestuck. That level of service is just something I personally, have never experienced. So when in Jakarta Indonesia, stay at the Westin Hotel and experience what Indonesian hospitality is all about. Many thanks and blessings to the staff, managers and everyone at the Westin. 🙏"
"198.","Ozz Lee","58","2023-01-01","4","I was here for a wedding reception and not to stay for the room. The halls were huge and beautiful, and the facility is well kept. Problem is because of the pandemic, we cant eat during the reception, they can only serve us snacks, and the food can only be given as take away boxes, which is not that good anymore since it's already cold and don't really look appetising put in boxes. Other thing that the hotel needs to address is how dark is the drive way leading from the lobby to the main road, which they need to put more lights. Overall beautiful hall, but needs more improvement."

"203.","Michael Shu","36","2022-01-01","2","I was only here for lunch at Seasonal Taste, food was mediocre at best. The view might be better at night due to the gray skies of Jakarta, but overall pretty chill place for a lunch meeting (the decor feels old tho). Price was 500K but I just found out beer is included, that's probably why the food was mediocre, I don't believe a great buffet can cost less than 500 for the food alone. I didn't enjoy the restaurant staffs tho, they're loud and joking around themselves during service. Although this is very common in Indonesia as we lack professional mannerism, it's certainly off-putting seeing it in a 5-star hotel"
"204.","Alex G","547","2020-01-01","5","Luxury at its best. Rooms are amazing, the view is amazing as well. Nothing to say. The breakfast is top notch. However, we booked one massage and the lady told us that we have to come back because the previous customer was late, as a result we were on the rush to go to the airport after that.... Massage itself was I think the best massage I had in my life."
"205.","Mari","426","2023-01-01","4","Stayed there for a week. Overall a pleasant experience. Room was good, Very spacious. However the hotel starts from level 52 and above. 52 is the lobby. There are only two lifts from the ground floor to the hotel lobby so you might need to wait for a while for the lift. From level 52 to the rest of the hotel floor(I think highest is level 69?), there are only three lifts. Also, you might need to wait a bit for the lifts every time. Breakfast food is so so. Found a caterpillar in my meatball noodle soup, they can do better with the food cleaning/hygiene. Service is good but can be a bit slow, I think it might be because of the lift issue as mentioned earlier. One thing to highlight is they really take feedback and act on it fast. I gave a feedback regarding decaf coffee and they made it available soon after that. Really appreciate the prompt response from the management. Location is not the best. Nearby mall is around ten minutes walk away but not recommended to walk there due to the hour weather and safety reason. Taking car is around 10-15 mins as well. During normal weekday, so much traffic in that area :( I might choose another hotel next time if I have a choice given the location issue."

When you try to book hotel - suites was available. I asked to come loyalty manager. And we could solve this question. Also we gave deposit on the reception. But when we was in the hotel bar we could not to write the bill (less than deposit) to the room, because front office rejected it.

The level service provided by the well-trained staff is unparalleled, exceeding even Ritz Singapore (which is a very high standard). The food is fabulous and diversified; cleanliness is a priority; rooms are spacious and pleasant, incredible executive lounge and main buffet."

Lokasi strategis karena dekat dengan pusat kesibukan Jakarta. Resikonya adalah kena ganjil genap untuk masuk ke jalan Rasuna Said. Makanan enak, obviously. Kalaupun tidak, banyak street food di sekitaran hotel. Jika dana tidak jadi masalah, maka disarankan untuk mencoba menginap di hotel ini."
"225.","Tuti Handayani","389","2020-01-01","5","We only used the meeting room for a five-day workshop. The meeting room is spacious and comfortable. The coffee is just perfect, they use a coffee maker and the taste was great. The snack is varied and delicious. The lunch time was our favourite moment during the workshop. The restaurant is on the 52 floor. You can enjoy your lunch with an amazing view of Jakarta. The food is varied from Indonesian food, Indian food, Italian food, Chinese food and Japanese food. My most favourite is the sushi station, the raw salmon tasted fresh and delicious. The desert were all delicious. You can also have ice cream! They provide a clean prayers room. The rest room was also clean. The hotel staffs were friendly and helpful. The Westin Jakarta is a very recommended 5 stars hotel in Jakarta."

"229.","Cauê Motta","73","2021-01-01","5","The Westin is the tallest building in Jakarta up until the time of this post, so that on its own makes it a unique place in town, right? But the fact that they took advantage of this feature and made the entire top part of the building a hotel (the lobby stays at the level 52, if I am not wrong) with restaurants and bars that take advantage of the incredible view. There are a range of different choices available for dining and they are pretty on par with the other 5 star restaurants in town, with all-you-can-eat buffets and great variety of food from different regions of the world. It’s conveniently located near Kuningan, which is a business district that’s currently pretty popular and a centre for expats in town. This makes the hotel an easy choice for socialisation among foreigners who can afford it (mind you it’s not a cheap place). Overall worth the visit if you’re looking for a good place to eat, but I haven’t stayed at the hotel itself, so won’t comment on the hospitality features."

Start from the service, the hospitality, the room, food, and all the facility. For the price, i think a little bit expensive, but it is very worthy for the experience that you will get. Btw they also have yakuzi ini 50th floor that will make you very very very very relax. Recommend and i will come again!"

Biat catatan adalah petunjuk jalan di area parkir sangat minim daaaaannnnn KECIL BANGET brooo 😑😑. Di tambah itu tukang parkirnya sangat tidak bersahabat. Nilainya merah untuk poin ini. Lain d bawah lain di atas. Security bagian bags check nya sangat sopan dan kooperatif. Doorman nya juga oke. Next Serasa main lopat lift 😂 soalny lobby hotel d lantai 52... Yak 52 banget Tapi tenang, liftnya ngebut banget. 52 lantai habis dalam kurang dari 1 menit 😂 dari situ, ketemu sama frontdesk, chitchat sedikit, sangat ramah dan membantu. Daan... Dari loby aja pemandangan nya udh keren banget 😍😍 Lanjut.. Naik lift lagi 😂😂 Ke kamar gw yg kebetulan d lantai 60 Pemangdangannya 😍😍😍😍😍 Kereeenn banget D tambah kamarnya juga keren, bersih, sophisticated banget furniture2nya, dan setiap detilnya sangat d perhatiin. Kaya karpet yang motif abstrak tapi cocok banget sama interiornya, meja kerja yg oke banget 😍😍 TV LED yg gedeee aja (yg ini gak pake banget, tp ttp TV terbesar yg pernah gw liat d dalam kamar hotel), switch lampu yg ada pilihan setting suasana yg kita pengen, jadi g capek2 ngaturnya (termasuk ampe ngatur buka tutup tirai juga lho) , coffee maker... Yak,,lo gak salah baca COFFEE MAKER 😆😆 Dan yg paling terakhir adalah...mereka bikin pintu kamar mandi yg keren banget, karena bisa d buka dari luar kalo gak sengaja ada orang kekunci atau kejadian buruk pas pintu kekunci dari dalem, dan hanya dg sebuah kartu pastik Overall Ini hotel bagus banget"

As a Bonvoy member, I can tell you that the Jakarta Westin did not uphold the customer service standard that we normally expect from the Marriott Bonvoy group. They were completely unsympathetic and should. We always come here for the food and stay here. Won’t be coming back here again ever."

You should change elevator at 52th floor for going to the bedroom.

I stayed here with my family a while ago in the high season to release stress from the pandemic and to spend time with my family. Here, depending on the type of room and price you pay, of course, not only can you get a great breakfast, but you can also enjoy afternoon tea and evening cocktail (with a variety of alcoholic beverages). And because we stayed in the high season, the evening cocktail was held at Henshin on the rooftop with a tremendously beautiful view. In the morning, we had a great breakfast. We can order everything we want in the menu book, and the food was all tastes excellent! Overall, it is a pleasant experience to stay here! Totally recommended 👍"

Tapi kalo skr enggk banget deh, yg paling keinget itu, salah satu direksi dateng duluan ke restoran untuk lunch, harusnya udh ada reservasi atas nama PT yg di booked tau nya engk ada, akhirnya ditelf ke PIC hotel nya n dibilang, maaf ke skip...n akhirnya baru di set table untuk kita. Mereka enak bilang maaf, tapi kita dari bagian GA kantor kan malu ama beliau, dikiranya gak profesional nanganin hal remeh begini..oiya sama pic hotel yg dr awal contact2an waktu hari H sama sekali gak nunjukin muka alasannya ada meeting ama klien lain (pdhal kita kan sama2 klien- perlakuannya harus sama dong) .. Untuk hotel sekelas ini,kita sih bayanginnya udh prof handling acaranya krn kita bukan sekali dua kali ngadain rapat di hotel Bintang 4 kaya gini.. Kalo ini bintang 3 n harganya juga relatif murah ya kita pasti gak ekspektasi tinggi .. Jadi kemungkinan untuk tahun depan kita mikir2 lagi deh kalo mw ngadain acara disini.. Untuk coffee break pas meeting enak, beberapa kali coba konsisten rasa nya, enak.. Makanan di seasonal taste nya juga enak.. Suka juga krn ruang meetingnya, akses ke lift dekat."

The attention to detail and cleanliness is unmatched so far, implementation of the health protocol is on another level. Definitely felt safe. The room was spacious and cozy, I had a good night rest. It was designed to pamper you with all the amenities. The food was amazing, this time around I was enjoying Indian food which did not dissapoint. The staff is knowledable about the products and can easily help if you are undecisive. Absolutely loved the coffee :)) Congratulations The Westin team, you have earned a repetitive guest"

Stunning views with floor to ceiling windows, bathtub with a view, and sound proof so even the storms seem quiet. The breakfast buffet is the most comprehensive and diverse I have ever encountered;with food from all corners of the globe. Whatever your schedule, don’t miss the breakfast! My room included Club access, and it’s worth it. Cocktails, beer, wine, coffee, teas, and juices are available in the evenings that accompany generous hors d’oeuvres. In the afternoon there are snacks and non-alcoholic beverages. Floor to ceiling windows surround this warm and intimate setting. Check in and check out were easy and friendly with an amazing staff serving throughout the hotel and restaurants. The pictures speak for themselves.. I highly recommend this hotel if it’s in your budget."

Security menegur saya dengan kasar karena masuk pintu keluar bukan pintu masuk (ingat pak, bapak kerja di perhotelan, bukan pabrik). Disana saya bertemu pegawai Westin yang sepertinya karyawan baru karena bingung menjawab dimana Café/loungenya. Ketika saya naik ke tujuan, salah satu waiter memberikan tatapan sinis kepada saya karena saya bertanya “apakah bisa duduk di Cafe/lounge untuk menunggu client saya” lalu dia jawab “duduk disitu aja ya Bu yang belum diberesin”, iya saya diberikan meja bekas pengunjung lain. Karena saya kesal, akhirnya saya memutari Cafe/lounge untuk mencari tempat yang nyaman untuk meeting dengan client. Hingga saya akan masuk ke tempat yang sepertinya ruang meeting (?) atau ruang vvip (?) idk. Tapi ketika saya menuju kesana, waiter sinis arogan itu memanggil saya seperti ayam “huss sstt husss jangan kesana, mau kemana? Gak bisa sembarangan kesana ya” Iya saya sedih karena direndahkan. Mungkin penampilan saya tidak pantas untuk datang ke tempat ini? Untungnya client saya hadir dan meminta saya untuk naik tangga sekali karena dia sudah sampai sana. Untuk waitress di tempat ini (sepertinya lounge) sangat baik karena aktif memberikan rekomendasi fnb untuk saya. Saya harap waiter sinis dan arogan itu bisa membaca postingan ini, jangan suka merendahkan orang karena belum tentu orang yang kamu rendahkan sesuai pemikiran kamu."

Apa hanya yg bawa mobil gitu ya yg diperlakukan dg baik di hotel westin ini? ☹️ Beda banget sama petugas keamanan disekitar hotel ritz carlton, saya lewat berjalan kaki juga disapa dg ramah sekali disana."

Di oper sana sini hanya untuk kluar parkir motor Saya sudah konfirmasi ke pihak hotel , kalau saya pakai motor . Daftarkan plat nomor motor Pas chek out kluar parkir . Malah di tahan oleh petugas parkir . Karna parkir berbayar Ini saya yg bodoh atau memang sistem hotel yg ga profesional ? Untuk apa saya rela bayar mahal untuk 1 kamar , dan deposit uang 1.800.000 hanya untuk chek in . Tapi malah sistem chek out nya amburadul . Parkir berbayar , dan harus menunggu lagi 20 mnt hanya untuk keluar parkir . Ah Payah . Dah Lah Males Chek In Di Sini Lagi . Ga Rekomen Buat Yg Ngejar Waktu Untuk Chek Out ."

"344.","Kim Jason","1","2025-03-21","1","Saya sudah menginap di hotel ini dua kali, tetapi pengalaman terakhir saya benar-benar seperti mimpi buruk. Karena infeksi bakteri yang parah, saya sama sekali tidak dapat menikmati layanan hotel. Sambil menderita demam tinggi, sakit kepala hebat, dan muntah-muntah tanpa henti, manajemen hotel lebih suka mengelak daripada memberikan bantuan nyata. Satu-satunya makanan yang saya makan hari itu hanyalah roti lapis dari lounge, dan hanya satu jam kemudian, saya merasa mual parah. Meskipun ada hubungan yang jelas ini, pihak hotel menolak untuk mengakui kesalahan apa pun. Parahnya lagi, saya harus menanggung sendiri semua biaya pengobatan, termasuk dokter dan obat-obatan. Alih-alih menunjukkan kepedulian terhadap kesejahteraan saya, manajemen justru memprioritaskan perlindungan diri mereka sendiri daripada memberikan keramahan yang layak. Ketidakpedulian dan kurangnya akuntabilitas mereka justru memperburuk situasi yang sudah buruk ini. Bagi Anda yang mempertimbangkan untuk menginap di hotel ini, saya sangat menyarankan Anda untuk berpikir dua kali. Ada banyak pilihan lain di Jakarta yang benar-benar peduli dengan kesehatan dan keselamatan tamu mereka. Hindari tempat ini dengan cara apa pun."
"345.","Richard","72","2025-01-21","1","Beberapa petugas keamanan Anda perlu dilatih tentang sopan santun dan rasa hormat yang mendasar. Saya baru-baru ini mengunjungi Westin Jakarta dan sangat kecewa dengan layanan yang saya terima di pintu masuk saat mengendarai sepeda motor. Saya salah mendekati gerbang yang salah. Alih-alih dipandu dengan sopan, saya malah dibentak secara tidak profesional oleh staf, yang membuat saya sangat malu. Ini adalah perilaku yang tidak dapat diterima, terutama dari hotel yang seharusnya 'mewah'. Penting untuk dicatat bahwa bukan kesalahan pengunjung jika rambu tidak jelas – hotel harus memastikan rambu-rambu terlihat dan mudah diikuti oleh semua tamu. Pengalaman ini sama sekali tidak mencerminkan keramahan yang saya harapkan dari hotel sekelas ini. Ketidakpedulian itu sangat buruk dan membuat saya benar-benar jijik. Dan yang lebih parah lagi, tanggapan mereka benar-benar memalukan. Westin Jakarta perlu melatih stafnya tentang sopan santun dan rasa hormat yang mendasar. Tingkat ketidakprofesionalan seperti ini sungguh memalukan. Keramahan seharusnya membuat setiap tamu merasa diterima, bukan diremehkan. *Apresiasi untuk petugas keamanan di gerbang pejalan kaki. Dia menanggapi keluhan saya dengan sangat baik dan bahkan meminta maaf. Jika pihak manajemen ingin memeriksa rekamannya: Jumat, 6 Desember 2024 Sekitar pukul 19.07"
"346.","강주영","113","2025-01-21","1","Saya biasanya lebih suka berpindah-pindah dan menginap di berbagai hotel daripada terpaku di satu hotel saja, karena saya senang membandingkan pengalaman. Minggu lalu, saya menginap di hotel lain selama tujuh hari, yang menawarkan keramahan hangat untuk anggota Bonvoy dan fasilitas yang sangat baik—sungguh sempurna. Hari ini, saya pindah ke Hotel Sheraton Gandaria, tapi sejujurnya, saya agak kecewa. Saya mengatur suhu kamar menjadi 22~23°C, tetapi bau apek dan kelembapannya membuatnya tidak nyaman. Jika saya menurunkan suhu di bawah 21°C, bau dan kelembapannya akan hilang, tetapi rasanya terlalu dingin untuk tidur nyenyak. Saya jadi bertanya-tanya, apakah hanya kamar tempat kami menginap ini yang bermasalah? Staf di sini lebih fokus pada layanan formal daripada menawarkan keramahan yang hangat. Jika saya kembali ke Jakarta, kemungkinan besar saya akan melewatkan tempat ini. Teman, kalau tanya saya, saya sarankan untuk menginap di tempat lain. Jika Anda anggota Bonvoy, ada hotel yang lebih baik yang memberikan sambutan yang jauh lebih hangat."

Mereka hanya akan mempersulit saya, sementara orang berpenampilan penting, orang Indo-Tiongkok, atau orang asing diperlakukan dan dilayani dengan baik.

Bukan hanya itu, dia memanggil stafnya dari bilik lain untuk menangani saya dan mengatakan bahwa dia tidak ingin menangani saya. Jadi saya bertanya kepada gadis yang saat itu menangani saya, dia berada di bilik sebelah, apakah saya berteriak? atau apakah Anda mendengar saya berteriak? atau apakah saya tampaknya berteriak sekarang saat saya berbicara?

Yang jadi poin saya adalah, bukan karena saya tidak sadar, sop memang harus dijalankan, tapi harus ya seorang manager memarahi bawahannya ditempat lalu di depan costumer? Iya mungkin dia salah, tapi saya tidak nyaman melihatnya, harusnya dia sebagai seorang manager menegurnya dengan membawa pelayan tersebut ke area yang tidak terlihat. SOP memang penting tapi attitude lebih penting."

Saya kurang suka konfigurasi liftnya yang harus naik ke lantai 52 lalu pindah ke lift lain untuk sampai ke kamar hotel. Sarapan hotelnya juga kurang enak. Kalau Anda suka hotel yang terlalu luas, hotel ini cocok untuk Anda. Namun, semua orang di hotel sangat ramah dan membuat masa inap saya jauh lebih baik."
"485.","Michael Shu","37","2022-01-21","2","Saya hanya ke sini untuk makan siang di Seasonal Taste, makanannya biasa saja. Pemandangannya mungkin lebih bagus di malam hari karena langit Jakarta yang kelabu, tapi secara keseluruhan tempatnya cukup nyaman untuk makan siang (dekorasinya terkesan kuno sih). Harganya 500 ribu, tapi saya baru tahu kalau bir sudah termasuk, mungkin itu sebabnya makanannya biasa saja. Rasanya prasmanan yang bagus tidak mungkin bisa menghabiskan kurang dari 500 untuk makanannya saja. Saya kurang suka dengan staf restorannya, mereka berisik dan bercanda sendiri saat melayani. Meskipun hal ini sangat umum di Indonesia karena kita kurang profesional, rasanya agak aneh melihat hal seperti ini di hotel bintang 5."
"486.","Emmanuel T Ginting","15","2023-01-21","2","Menginap selama 3 malam. Hotelnya memang luar biasa. Namun, agak kecewa dengan layanan di restoran sarapan. Saya merasa ada diskriminasi (seperti yang dialami beberapa turis Melayu di Bali). Para pelayan sangat sopan terhadap beberapa tamu Jepang. Namun, ketika mereka melayani saya, seorang pria lokal berkulit sawo matang, sikapnya sangat berbeda. Kecewa."
"487.","Reynold Ryesbiyanto","15","2024-01-21","2","Kamarnya oke sesuai dengan standar hotel bintang 5, tapi satu hal yang saya sadari di jakarta adalah jika Anda tidak membawa mobil mewah, mereka akan meremehkan Anda. Kejadian td siang jam 1 siang, pas pada saat kita checkout, padahal kita lg bawa barang2, sedangkan petugas valet malah tidak berusaha/meminta membawakan tas kita. Kita stay disini bukan untuk memamerkan barang2 branded atau mobil mewah. Itu sebabnya Jakarta terkenal dengan sikapnya yang suka menghakimi."
"488.","Fryza Pavitta","33","2022-01-21","2","Ini adalah tipe hotel yang akan Anda pesan untuk perjalanan bisnis. Bukan untuk liburan keluarga. Kami menginap untuk liburan tahun baru dan pengalamannya sangat standar. Tidak ada yang istimewa. Prasmanan untuk sarapan sangat standar dan hanya menyajikan pilihan sayuran yang sangat sedikit, jadi cukup sulit untuk menyiapkan menu makanan lengkap untuk anak saya. Makan malam ala carte juga butuh waktu lama untuk keluar dari dapur. Singkatnya, ini membuat saya berpikir bahwa hotel seperti ini benar-benar perlu memperbarui diri agar sesuai dengan standar pengalaman saat ini. Mungkin mencoba menyediakan lebih banyak pilihan makanan sehat? Taman di dalam gedung? Pilihan OTT?"
"489.","Putari","583","2023-01-21","2","Saya ada acara di lantai 69, butuh waktu lama untuk mencapai musholla, tidak ada petunjuk arah yang jelas. Pengaturan lift mereka sangat tidak praktis dengan petunjuk arah yang minim, staf mereka di lantai 52 tidak ramah ketika saya bertanya tentang lokasi musholla mereka, bahkan tidak melihat saya. Tidak direkomendasikan untuk acara perusahaan, pertimbangkan harga dan bintang hotel mereka dibandingkan dengan layanan yang kami dapatkan."
"490.","Hendro Hoo","41","2024-01-21","2","Kami sedang berlibur di hotel ketika kami terjebak oleh lalu lintas padat di sekitar Gatot Subroto ketika kami ingin sampai di sana jadi kami berencana untuk menelepon hotel The Westin bahwa kami akan terlambat untuk check-in, setelah kami tiba kemudian cerita dimulai, mulai ke lobi GF, staf tidak ramah ketika bertemu tamu (hampir pukul 23.00 malam), dia menyuruh saya turun dengan mobil saya dengan semua barang bawaan saya sementara saya bertanya di mana lobi dan saya ingin menurunkannya di lobi terlebih dahulu dia hanya mengatakan tidak bisa berhenti di sini, saya mengerti mungkin karena mobil saya tidak terlihat mewah seperti mobil lain yang parkir di depan lobi saya kira. Kemudian di ruang bawah tanah tidak ada tanda dan petunjuk arah ke mana harus mendapatkan lift ke lobi, Untungnya terima kasih untuk petugas kantor depan, dia melayani kami dengan senyum yang luar biasa setidaknya membuat kami merasa lebih baik. Untuk liburan keluarga tidak disarankan, untuk bisnis seharusnya lebih baik meskipun koneksi internet kadang-kadang turun (tidak stabil)"
"491.","Kusnadi Halim Salim","261","2018-01-21","2","Pemandangan hotel yang menakjubkan, yang menghadap ke jantung kota Jakarta, sangat diremehkan oleh standar pelayanan para pelayan dan penyambut tamu restoran yang di bawah standar.

Nyatanya tidak sama sekali, check in pk14:14, kamar belum siap, ok kita tunggu di lounge sampai pk 16:00 kamar baru siap, kami harus datang ke front desk berkali² untuk pastikan kamar kami siap. Saat masuk kamar tidak sesuai notes kami, request twin disediakan king, extra bed belum terpasang, sangat tidak baik tamu sudah didalam, minta extra bed saat reservasi, tapi baru set up saat tamu sudah didalam kamar. Suami put notes bahwa kami anniversary dan membawa anak². Nyatanya hanya dikasih tulisan ucapan di cermin, oke thank you. Akhirnya suami datang lagi ke front desk untuk memastikan tipe kamar, dan kita dipindahkan ke twin, tapi kamar masih belum siap, tamu baru check out, jam berapa itu sudah pk17. Akhirnya kita pergi makan dulu, dan suami baru ditelpon westin pk19 menginfokan bahwa kamar ready. Masuk kamar, apakah ada compliment anniversary atau mungkin untuk kids? Tidak ada juga. Baik gpp mungkin lupaa atau sistem error. Yah begitulah kesan pertama kami menginap di hotel ini."
"560.","Rio Sutrisno","166","2024-01-21","3","Pertama kali datang kesan pertama adalah resepsionis ketika datang diminta uang jaminan per malam, jujur pertama kali saat ke hotel yg sudah guarantee letter diminta uang jaminan, jaminan harus cc atau uang tunai dan tidak bisa debit atau transfer oke saya akhirnya cukup lama untuk mencari atm. Setelah saya kembali dapat info dari teman kalau dia tidak diminta uang jaminan dan saat saya tanya resepsionis lagi dibilang tidak apa-apa tidak pakai uang jaminan. Serasa dikerjai karena cukup lama cari atm, lalu disebutkan kalau sarapan hanya dapat 1 padahal saya diinfo marketing kalau dapat 2 dan saya diminta hubungi marketing. Bukan mereka yg konfirmasi. Setelah konfirm info marketing benar dapat 2 tp di hari pertama karena masih di tolak di resto jadi hanya boleh 1 sarapan, saya konfirm kembali ke marketing katanya mau di setting ulang agar 2 sarapan dan data terinput di hari kedua ternyata peserta masih komplain resto masih mencatat 1 sarapan. Dan setelah minta cek dll akhirnya di hari kedua bisa 2 sarapan. Singkat kata saat acara selesai dan check out ternyata di lobby bawah ada tamu yg marah2 karena perlakuan yg kurang sopan dan sering membeda²kan tamu. Intinya pelayanan kurang profesional dan kurang ramah dibanding hotel² bintang 5 lain yg saya pernah datangi dan buat acara, mungkin sekarang saya hanya tamu tp karena kesan pertama yg kurang baik saya dan teman yg menginap merasa kurang rekomendasikan apabila mengadakan untuk acara yg lebih besar dengan banyak peserta disini."

"564.","Yuristy F","51","2023-01-21","3","Kesini karena ngadain rapat kantor.. Tahun lalu pelayanannya bagus. Tapi kalo skr enggk banget deh, yg paling keinget itu, salah satu direksi dateng duluan ke restoran untuk lunch, harusnya udh ada reservasi atas nama PT yg di booked tau nya engk ada, akhirnya ditelf ke PIC hotel nya n dibilang, maaf ke skip...n akhirnya baru di set table untuk kita. Mereka enak bilang maaf, tapi kita dari bagian GA kantor kan malu ama beliau, dikiranya gak profesional nanganin hal remeh begini..oiya sama pic hotel yg dr awal contact2an waktu hari H sama sekali gak nunjukin muka alasannya ada meeting ama klien lain (pdhal kita kan sama2 klien- perlakuannya harus sama dong) .. Untuk hotel sekelas ini,kita sih bayanginnya udh prof handling acaranya krn kita bukan sekali dua kali ngadain rapat di hotel Bintang 4 kaya gini.. Kalo ini bintang 3 n harganya juga relatif murah ya kita pasti gak ekspektasi tinggi .. Jadi kemungkinan untuk tahun depan kita mikir2 lagi deh kalo mw ngadain acara disini.. Untuk coffee break pas meeting enak, beberapa kali coba konsisten rasa nya, enak.. Makanan di seasonal taste nya juga enak.. Suka juga krn ruang meetingnya, akses ke lift dekat."
