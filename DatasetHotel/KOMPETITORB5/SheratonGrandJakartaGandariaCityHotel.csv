The rooms too give an impressive feeling. Breakfast in the lounge was supported exceptionally by Fikri and Alif. They made the experience a higher quality event. The breakfast had great options including serving gluten free. The lounge was a great experience and was well serviced by the team including Theresa, Rahmat they were professional throughout the day and fun and during the check out process."
"2.","Alex Hu","1","2025-12-18","5","Another visit to Sheraton Gandaria for family staycation. As usual, everything is outstanding, from checking in, breakfast at the lounge, etc and the gym facility. I had a good time with my boy there, working out on the big punching bag. Service is excellent, and Mr Febri from the club lounge offered my little girl to join the choco art session, thank you. I did have some issue when trying to reserve a table at Anigre restaurant a week before checking in, but the hotel immediately fixed it and provided the solution that I believe return hotel guest deserved for. All in all, will be back to this hotel and fully recommend for those looking for hotel for staycation or business visit."

However, there was no soap tube in the washtafel only bar soap, And the soap, shampoo, conditioner, and body lotion didn't smell good. Getting to the parking lot is complicated, and there's no security guard at the entrance parking area. It's a bit unsafe. Please pay attention and increase security and guarding. And also the above I reviewed. Thanks"
"4.","Yustisia Putri","29","2025-12-25","5","This is one of the best hotels you can find in South Jakarta, it is near many places such as Pasar Kebayoran Lama, Pondok Indah, Gandaria. You can explore city life and markets near here. Other than that, the hotel is located on top of Gandaria City Mall. The rooms are nice, the food is also nice and tasty. But the price is quite expensive for locals."
"5.","Ilman F","57","2025-12-04","5","Stayed at Sheraton Gandaria City and had a very pleasant experience. The rooms were modern, clean, and comfortable, with great attention to detail. The location is extremely convenient since it’s directly connected to the mall — perfect for food, shopping, or just walking around. The service was warm and professional, and the staff made the stay feel smooth and welcoming. Breakfast had a good variety and was enjoyable. Overall, a great hotel for both leisure and business stays — comfortable, convenient, and well-managed."

"8.","PAUL RICHARD TAN (Richard Tan)","65","2025-12-11","5","Almost three weeks of bliss at Sheraton Jakarta Gandaria City! This was a work trip but felt like a home away from home. From the security, housekeeping staff, restaurant workers, club lounge, and chefs, I was enthralled with the level of professionalism, outmost service, and overall dedication. Huge shout out to the club room staff! Club Lounge: Meilani, Farel, ⁠Theresia, Akhsa, Fikri, Alif, Yani, Puja, Nola and Nico. The Chef at club room made wonderful dishes and were going above and beyond: Bazila, ⁠Amel, Andri, Aulia, and Febri. The housekeepers made my room so comfy and homey: Aldino, Sifiana, and Habibi. Last but not the least, Ms. Novi Susanti (FD Manager). Her demeanor and attention to detail was very impressive. She absolutely rock and made my stay so memorable! Terima Kasih Sheraton Grand Jakarta Gandaria City Hotel!"
"9.","Marti","7","2025-12-01","5","Was pleasantly surprised! From the moment we arrived until we departed, the service was seamless and professional. I was expecting the property to be a little aged; however, it has been well preserved and maintained with a classic yet timeless decor. Would like to highlight Pak Nurillah for his smooth and professional check-in, as well as Chef Anton, who was very friendly and engaging during breakfast :)"
"10.","Asdi Susetya","14","2025-12-01","1","saya ngga habis pikir sama hotel yang sudah tahu jauh dari parkiran, tapi tidak pernah berbenah soal pendaftaran parkir. Tolong pegawainya dilatih lagi supaya tetap fokus mendaftarkan parkir bagi pengunjung yg menginap membawa kendaraan, saya baru saja mau keluar parkiran motor tetapi tidak bisa karena emoney yg didaftarkan pegawai hotel adalah kendaraan mobil. Masalahnya saya bukan hanya sejam 2 jam parkir, tapi sudah 2 hari dan argo parkir pastinya mahal dan ini murni kesalahan pihak hotel, mau ngga mau saya harus naik lagi ke hotel utk revisi pendaftaran parkir dan jaraknya masyaAllah jauh banget, saya lari pp aja sudah 30 menit apalagi kalau jalan bisa satu jam pp. Parahnya lagi dari sekian banyaknya pegawai TIDAK ADA SATUPUN yg mengucapkan MAAF atas kelalalian tim mereka sendiri (TERMASUK CAPTAINNYA). Saya tanya petugas parkir ternyata memang kejadiannya sangat sering pihak hotel salah input karena HUMAN ERROR, tepat sebelum saya juga ada yg pegawainya salah menuliskan 1 huruf plat nomornya. Jujur sangat disayangkan, petugas restoran sudah sangat ramah memberikan pelayanan dgn harapan reviewnya bagus tapi dijatuhkan sama pegawai resepsionis bagiaj pendaftaran parkir yg tidak fokus bekerja! Saya harap pihak hotel bisa lebih berbenah agar tidak ada pengunjung lagi yang dirugikan"

"16.","Xenia wen","17","2025-10-01","5","Everything was wonderful , and this was my 2nd time stayed in Sheraton Grand Gandaria City. We came in a big group , and reserved for 4 rooms. The location was so strategic and convenient , next to Gandaria City Mall. The room was so big, and clean, very comfortable to sleep after a long distance trip. The breakfast has lots of variety, and the FnB staff was so attentive and special thanks for Chef Tedi Rizki, who introduced the special food on that day nasi goreng cakalang , which is so delicious. All the staff from FnB were so care and special thanks as well for Ms Luci who serve us wholeheartedly. Will definitely back again when we come to Indonesia and highly recommend this hotel for whoever searching the place to stay."

"38.","Y. Thariq Albab Basusena","25","2025-06-01","4","The room was adequate but nothing exceptional. It was spacious and included a toilet without a bathtub. The toiletries were standard—functional, but not particularly impressive. The pool was also just average, which fell short of expectations for a five-star hotel. Breakfast offered a variety of options, but none stood out. There's definitely room for improvement, especially with more authentic selections. Out of my expectation (and never thought) if their bread and butter pudding was best out of all. The highlight was the location—excellent, with direct access to Gandaria City Mall, which features a wide range of shops, restaurants, and entertainment options. Parking also great."
"39.","Wely Lau","44","2025-08-01","5","Awesome hotel, next to a big shopping mall, very nice hospitality and service. Staff are all so welcoming and friendly. Huge shout out to Lounge team (Bu Meilani, Mbak Theresia, Mas Farel) and also Anigre team (Bu Panca, Mbak Rista, Mas Sandi)."

"42.","Sannishara A. Wardhani","25","2025-08-01","4","The best thing that happened during our hotel stay? Hands down, the IMAX at Gandaria City Mall—what a dream. I’d come back just for that. But honestly, the hotel itself did not disappoint either. The room was spacious and cozy, perfect for two people to move around without bumping into each other every second. We did have a little moment with the AC—somehow it decided to go full Arctic even when we set it warmer, so we ended up just turning it off. Crisis averted. 😂 The amenities though? Chef’s kiss. I was obsessed with the bathtub—it was giving main character energy—and the in-room ironing set was a total game-changer, especially for people like us who always need to press something last-minute. Now breakfast? Say less. It was delicious, filling, and had just the right variety. They even had Indomie, which is already a win, but then they brought out a new menu item—Jasuke (yes, the iconic corn + cheese + milk combo)—and it was surprisingly so good I talked about it for days. Another major plus is the location. It’s super accessible via public transport, and since it’s connected to Gandaria City Mall, you can literally shop, eat, watch movies, grab Chagee, and just vibe—all without stepping outside. Overall? 10/10 would stay again. It was comfy, convenient, and had the little joys that made the experience feel special."
"43.","Mr. T","21","2025-10-01","5","On my recent business trip to Jakarta, I received professional service and hospitality from The Sheraton grand Jakarta staff from the moment that I entered through the front doors of the lobby. Due to a scheduling change, I showed up to the hotel a full 12 hours in advance of my reserved check in time. However, the front desk was more than capable of assisting me with getting your room the early hours of the morning. Despite arriving so early in the morning there was no no difference in the level of service that the hotel staff provided. The next morning at breakfast the unparalleled level 5 service and hospitality continued. The food service Staff were attentive to my requests and encouraged me to try local dishes that were available on the buffet and by special request. Lusi, Panca, and Sahra were extremely helpful in suggesting Indonesian dishes and explaining their cultural significance. Housekeeping was also attentive. The daily housekeeping provided by Okta was swift and timely and the room was immaculately cleaned."
"44.","SisterLy Trading Post","8","2025-10-01","5","I had the pleasure of spending a week at the Sheraton Gandaria in Jakarta, and it was one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had at a hotel chain. As a business traveler and a loyalist of the Marriott brand who have stayed at many hotels, my recent stay at the Sheraton Jakarta Gandaria ranks number one for its location and the ‘superb’ customer service. The hotel is conveniently connected to a mall, security guards at every entrance/exit, and a club lounge on the 20th floor. Upon arrival on the first day, I was greeted with smiles and a team eager to assist and make my weeklong stay comfortable. The 20th floor club lounge is run and managed by Ms. Meilani Tambunan who greets all with her beautiful smile and so much care. Meilani runs the lounge like a well oiled machine. Breakfast, snacks, and dinner is served daily from the 20th floor club lounge. There were many delicious food options from western to eastern dishes. My elderly mother (“Mama”) in law, who has osteoarthritis, was well taken great of by Meilani and her team. Every morning, they made sure Mama had plenty to eat and drink, assisted her at the food buffet, and always made sure her needs were met. Chef Zila and Fikri often came by at breakfast to share the daily specials and even brought assorted dishes from the kitchen for us to try. Our tummies were always so full and satisfied. We were greeted every morning with smiles from a dedicated team. They were there for Mama and took care of her when I had to depart the hotel before Mama. Meilani took great care of Mama, organized her transportation to the airport, and frequently checked in on Mama to make sure my elderly mother-in-law was well. I am so appreciative of this team who went above and beyond to create a hotel stay that felt like “home away from home.” The staff’s attention to details and just how thoughtful and caring they were to my Mama and I meant so much to me. We also booked 2 spa treatments, and the massages were easily one of the best massages that I have ever had. Susan and Rita (massage therapists) had healing hands! It was hard leaving after a week because I felt as though I was leaving good friends and a family behind from Indonesia. The staff strives for excellence, and you will be spoiled here. Thank you -- Meilani, Puja, Fikri, Chef Febri, Chef BaZila, Alif, Akhsa, Theresia, Faral, Danang, Rahmat, Salma, Aliah, and Rahma."

Ada akses langsung ke mall dari dalam mall."
"46.","Alim Chandra","42","2025-05-01","5","One of the best Stay-cations I have ever experienced. Don't regret at all for choosing this place to celebrate a special occasion, birthday (a little late post). Rooms are Superb and meet the Sheraton standard. By that i mean the best! as I love sheraton Rooms most out of all the Mariott Hotels. Super bed and pillows that make sleep feels so good, am a light sleeper but can always deep sleep in Sheratons hotels. Service wise is top notch! Very very friendly and professional. Best I have experienced so far in all of Mariott hotels in Jakarta. Despite a little hiccup upon check in process, but the team handled it well and apologized. Thank you so much Mba Meilani for giving super service making my stay unforgettable and I want to come back asap! Going to break down several memorable moments: As it was my birthday, was surprised by the front desk team with a cake (cake very delicious btw, not too sweet - highest praise from an asian). Thank you so much once again! Breakfast is great! Thank you so much to Mas Ferdinand and Mba Panca for being super attentive on the customers' needs (not just to us but all around us upon our observation) and recommendations are superb. I don't usually eat much for breakfast but your recommendations are really great and made me skip lunch (too full) :D. And finally another mariott hotel that can make one of the best scrambled eggs like in japan (half cooked, still runny!!). Been to many hotels in Indonesia and theres only 2 places now that can make exactly based on our request (thank you to Mba Meilani for noting this as well during our chats on the previous day). As a birthday gift, I was given a special treat for a 60 minute massage. And seriously can't thank Mba Mailani enough. One of the best massages I have ever had. I am not just saying this out of gratefulness as it was a special treat, but objectively it seriously is great. Mba Anggi and Nita are real experts, making us feel relaxed until I feel like a jelly after the massage (too relaxed haha). Just to give you an understanding on how good they are, for those who like to go on reflexology massages must know that usually when they massage our fingers (both leg and hands) tend to feel a little sting from the pinching motion. This one I dont feel any discomfort sting at all, they dont pinch they put perfect pressure and stop at the right moment! I was in awe. Overall the best experience so far even compared to other high-end Marriotts in Jakarta, i really will come back and choose Sheraton Gandaria if there were future Staycation plans. Thank you team once again for making our stay feel better than home."

"53.","Maria","1","2025-06-01","1","An Unpleasant Experience at the Pool Area I stayed at Sheraton and had the opportunity to use the swimming pool while wearing activewear (a sports top and fairly tight leggings). The outfit felt comfortable and, in my opinion, was still appropriate. However, I also understood that it might not fully align with the dress code, so before entering, I asked the female staff member at the sports gate whether it was allowed. She mentioned no restrictions and allowed me to enter without issue. While I was swimming, the same staff member approached me and said that my outfit was “not allowed because a platinum member had complained.” I immediately apologized and said I would get out of the pool right away. But she continued, saying, “This is a warning from a platinum member. They’re a regular guest here and said you shouldn’t be wearing that.” At that point, I felt quite cornered. The “platinum member” status was mentioned repeatedly, as if that alone justified the reprimand — not because of any clearly communicated hotel policy. I was disappointed with how the message was delivered. If there are specific rules regarding swimwear, staff should communicate them objectively and consistently based on hotel policy. We fully understand that hotels have their own rules, but in this case, the staff based the reprimand on a guest complaint and their loyalty status, which felt inappropriate. I believe that every guest, regardless of membership status, deserves to be treated with courtesy and professionalism. I hope Sheraton can improve internal communication and service standards so that all guests — regardless of membership tier — feel respected and treated fairly."
"54.","Shubham Gupta","486","2025-07-01","5","Great place to stay in Jakarta. Near to city center, adjacent to a mall. The breakfast spread is huge and multi-cuisine.

All the staff are well trained, including kitchen staff. They treated us very nicely. I got special wedang Jahe when they find out I have sore throat, it was initiated from the chef at the club lounge The concierge manager helped me to pack my plants with the paper bag. And now we are on the way to the hotel again because we love their hospitality 😍 Sheraton gandaria will be our second home when we travel to Jakarta. You guys are awesome 👏🏼 This morning I met my favorite chef Zila at the club lounge, omg!!! She’s amazingly sweet to make sure that our stays are always meet our expectations 🤩(19 June 2025)"
"63.","Ekky Tian Kusuma","39","2025-08-01","5","It is a very decent hotel and no question if you are talking about 'Sheraton' brand. I booked a room with a queen bed, comes with a complete amenities and spacious room. The location is very strategic as the hotel nearby with one of the crowded places in South Jakarta i.e. Pondok Indah. Best thing to stay here is you just need less than 5 minutes from your room to go to the Gandaria City Mall as there is a connecting hallaway to the mall building. You won't be regret if you stay for long in this hotel, but the price is consider to moderate to high"

Location in the complex of Gandaria City Mall, so no worry for shopping and culinary Hotel parking area is at Mall B2 level (just follow the sign) Check in check out is super easy and quick. Room is clean and fresh with complete amenities and perfect Aircon. Sheraton Club in the afternoon is perfect for break fasting (Stay during Ramadan), with various and complete menu. Anigre Restaurant is also perfect (seperate review)."

And I think it's all because of the hotel! It all started with Kevin who helped me with the check-in, convinced to get upgraded with lounge access. Then I was immediately greeted by the lovely people at the lounge. Farrel, Meilani and Michelle were angels. The young lady who manned the noodle bar on 18th was the only one who added a spoon to the bowl and asked me if I wanted chilly sauce. It's all these little things added up to a better than good, but fantastic experience!"

"86.","kramotakra","31","2025-05-01","5","This review is geared more for BonVoy Elite members but I'm sure everyone can benefit from it . BLUF, this is the best bang for your buck 5 star hotel as BonVoy Elite members! Check out the reviews on Marriott app and you'll see Sheraton Gandaria is just under Ritz Carlton and St Regis. However , those two costs hundreds of dollars more. You also have to pay extra for Ritz lounge and Regis does not have club lounge. Yes it's quite far from the airport and city center, but spend an extra $5to $10on grab or taxi and you would be pleasantly surprised by how much more youd be rewarded. I met visitors from Japan and Singapore who also echoed my sentiment. This is the second time I stay. Last time was a birthday treat for my mother and this time is for my dad. We stay in the Executive Suite for 5 days. I was thoroughly impressed especially by the culinary treats. Normally you would see menu repeats after 3 to 4 days. However, at day 5, Sheraton Gandaria still serves new delectable menu at breakfast and Hors d'oeuvres. Barramundi sashimi, ox tail soup, lobster bisque, roast duck, fish curry, etc. the delicacies never end. I initially planned to check out few restaurants at the adjoining mall but by day 3 it became unnecessary. The endless culinary adventure absolutely beats Ritz, Regis, 4 seasons, Westin etc and i had stayed in these hotels in Doha, Athens, Aspen, Dubai, San Fransico. Sheraton Grand Gandaria City is absolutely world class. The suite, service, check in process, free parking and access to mall is unparalleled. I got to see a movie or two on iMax and get few shoppings done as well. In the rare chance you're not satisfied with the hotel restaurants, then youre a hop away from dozens of local, western and eastern specialty restaurants in the mall 1st, 2nd and top floors. The pool and gym are just as nice as the service. The adjoining mall has literally everything from grocery, medicine, food, golf clubs, shoes, to high end electronics and even drones! You would spend days here without the need to get anything from outside! Thank you Chef Husain, Agung, and Tedi! You guys really spoiled me! The coffee ground rub dry aged Filet Mignon was exquisite! I have not tasted anything like that before. The oxtail soup was as delectable as last year. The dosa was surprisingly really good, a testament to Marriott chef exchange program. And thank you for the crispy crepe to go. It was better than the one I had in Brussels! Thank you Susan for the great massage and for taking your time with my dad. You are a seasoned pro and I highly recommend the spa massages for anyone to delight in! Thank you Farel and Meilano. Your hospitality and professionalism truly shine! Thank you for providing the information for trip to Labuan Bajo too. Please thank the bartenders who made custom White Russian with rum and Kahlua. Those were great! Thank you Fadol, Fandy, Salma, Salsa, Kheyla, Syita for decorating the room. Dad was happy and took many pictures. Thank you Satria and Nadiva for the extra coffee in the room and the cute towel animal arts. Mom was very impressed and took pictures."

"90.","J. Lepianda","810","2025-01-01","5","The Sheraton Grand Jakarta offers an exceptional stay, especially in the Club Grand Suite, which spans an impressive 76 square meters. The suite is beautifully appointed, combining modern luxury with comfort, making it an ideal retreat for both business and leisure travelers. One of the standout features of our stay was the breakfast experience. The buffet is simply delightful, boasting an extensive variety of options that cater to all tastes. From fresh pastries and fruits to a range of hot dishes, each morning felt like a culinary adventure. The quality of the food was consistently high, and the attentive staff ensured that everything was well-stocked and presented beautifully. In addition to the lavish breakfast, the hotel’s amenities and service were top-notch. The staff were friendly and accommodating, making our stay even more enjoyable. The location is also a significant plus, providing easy access to shopping and entertainment. Exclusive access to the Club Lounge, reserved for suite guests, further enhances the experience. This serene space offers complimentary refreshments and snacks throughout the day, making it an ideal spot to unwind or hold informal meetings. The lounge’s atmosphere is perfect for relaxation after a busy day. Overall, the Sheraton Grand Jakarta exceeds expectations with its spacious suites and delightful dining options. It’s a perfect choice for those seeking a luxurious and relaxing getaway in the heart of the city. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a memorable hotel experience."

I said i have bonvoy member from the beginning and he have asked the email member. However, the price endup wrong. And he did not say sorry. And i ask why is it diff, and he said because i wasnt put the member disc. Man, this man always put his head high and speak like a robot. The rest of sheraton staff was always genuine like never before..but this man really act like an entitled man. Not a very good experience to come back here again. They also not asked if my baby need baby crib or anything. So yeah, paid more expensive for not so good welcome"

Anyway, I wanted to have a table by the window but was told it was reserved. It wasn't on a first-come, first-served basis, so it felt a bit strange that a hotel restaurant, not an outside restaurant, would take reservations for a certain guest."
"96.","강주영","107","2025-01-01","5","There were some minor issues with the facilities, but considering the nature of the area and the age of the building, these are things one has to accept. That said, the staff more than made up for those small shortcomings with their outstanding service. (The hotel owner should truly be grateful to their team!) The food was also beautifully presented and absolutely delicious, which added to the overall experience. Most of the staff acted very professionally, and my initial disappointment eventually turned into complete satisfaction. In conclusion, trusting the Sheraton name and choosing this place turned out to be a pretty good decision."

Petugas nya menyambut dengan ramah dan helpfull. Lobi nya luas , mevvah juga harum. Oiya karena hotel ini menyatu dengan Gancit Mall jadi kalau kita mau jalan2 ke mall hanya tinggal turun saja ke lobby hotel.. Sepanjang koridor menuju ke room di sodorkan dengan aromatherapi yg menenangkan sehingga membuat siapapun marasa nyaman pasti nya. Kamar nya nyaman juga bersih. Amenities lengkap tak kurang 1 pun. Furniture nya jg unik menurut saya. Kamar mandi nyaman dan mewah begitu juga shower gel, shampoo dan conditioner nya bukan merk abal². Semua perlengkapan mandi seperti handuk di sediakan dlm berbagai ukuran dan jenis nya. Resto nya luas, petugas nya juga ramah dan helpfull..varian makanan nya sangat banyak dan untuk taste nya ga ada yang gagal di lidah saya. Bahkan sebelum keluar dari resto chef nya pun menyapa dan bertanya bagaimana kesan makanan yang kami makan. Kolam renang nya bersih dan di sini juga di sediakan handuk sehingga kita tidak perlu membawa dari kamar. Sekian review dari saya.. masyaaAllaah puas sekali dengan pelayanan di sheraton grand jakarta ini. Semoga lain waktu kami bisa staycation lagi di sini. Terimakasih sheraton grand jakarta😊"

The location is highly strategic, with direct access to Gandaria City Mall, making it incredibly convenient for shopping and dining. Upon arrival, the bellboy promptly assisted with my luggage, ensuring a smooth and welcoming start to my stay. The check-in process was quick and efficient, handled by attentive and friendly staff who demonstrated excellent recognition for Marriott Bonvoy Elite members. My room was spacious, clean, and well-equipped, complete with a bathtub in the bathroom and all the necessary amenities for a comfortable stay. Breakfast at the restaurant offered a wide variety of delicious options, maintaining the same high standard I’ve experienced during my previous stays here—well done! The hotel facilities, including the gym and pool, were well-maintained, with staff available to assist guests. The club lounge was also a pleasant experience, with friendly and attentive staff. For guests arriving by car, parking is available in the basement. However, since the parking area is shared with Gandaria City Mall, it can be challenging to find a spot during peak hours, like weekends, and the access to the hotel lobby can be slightly confusing. Despite this minor inconvenience, my overall experience at the hotel was enjoyable and satisfying. Highly recommended for those looking for a comfortable and conveniently located stay in Jakarta"

"115.","Andy Lee","82","2025-06-01","1","Its a shame and very disappointingHere is your text translated into polished and professional English: A Truly Embarrassing and Disappointing Stay My recent stay at Sheraton Gandaria City was deeply embarrassing and disappointing. I arrived late at night to check in, only to feel completely unrecognized and unappreciated by the front desk staff, particularly Shafina. At check-in, I was informed that there were no suite rooms available—only larger rooms designated for smokers, and otherwise just the standard room I originally booked. Out of curiosity, I checked the Marriott app and saw that Suite rooms were in fact available. When I inquired again, she responded that there might be a mismatch between the app and their actual availability. Fine. But then I checked again and saw that even rooms above the Junior Suite were available. When I asked about those, she said I could stay in one for an extra IDR 2.5 million—but she could offer a 50% discount, making it IDR 1.25 million. I declined and decided to proceed with my original room. I even emphasized that I am a Titanium Member, to which she responded that Titanium Members are only eligible for upgrades up to a Junior Suite. This raises a serious question—why would a Titanium Member be treated this way? Isn’t one of the core benefits of Titanium Elite status complimentary upgrades, including to suites, when available? So, which is it? Are suites only available for an additional cost, or are they truly not available? It seems inconsistent, especially since my friend was once upgraded to the Presidential Suite, and I myself have been upgraded to the Presidential Suite at other Sheraton locations. Could it be because I was using points this time that I was restricted? If so, what’s the point of being part of Marriott Bonvoy? Do we earn points without actually staying? If not, why was my status not honored? This visit was truly disappointing. Not even a welcome card acknowledging my Elite Membership was provided. Good job—there won’t be a next time here."

"123.","Ala Faradisi","118","2025-01-01","5","Rekomen bgt buat staycation dalam kota sama keluarga 👍 Buat bisnis trip juga oke 👍 Beberapa kali nginep disini kesan mewahnya selalu dapet, semua staff ramah dan sigap kecuali staff yg jaga di area swimming pool (sorry). Turun lobby langsung dibantu dan proses check in cepet bgt, lobby luas, bersih, dekorasinya mewah dan banyak sofa untuk duduk menunggu selagi proses check in. Naik ke kamar ada 3 lift, lift nya juga cepet gapake lama nunggu. Dan harus tap kartu kamar buat naik keatas jadi aman ga sembarang org bisa naik. Masuk kamar nuansanya putih marmer. Saya sudah coba room deluxe dan juga suitesnya. Semua bersih dan nyaman. Sudah tersedia kulkas dan bath up. Full karpet kecuali di area foyer, lemari besar tersedia iron board dan hair dryer. Kamar mandinya juga besar dan bagus, amenities lengkap. Minusnya di area shower pintu kacanya ga rapat jadi kalo mandi airnya suka keluar2 sehingga area wastafelnya banjir. Kasur empuk dan besar, nilai plus karena bantalnya super empuk ga seperti hotel lain yg bantalnya tebal dan keras. Ada sofa disudut ruang dan juga meja kerja. Pokonya roomnya sangat nyaman buat lama2 istirahat dikamar. Disini saya sempetin coba fasilitas swimming poolnya. Tempatnya bagus, cukup luas ada 2 kolam, kolam anak yg dangkal dan kolam dewasa sekitar 140cm. Disekeliling banyak area duduk2nya dan ada semacam stand makanan dari resto hotel. Untuk kamar bilasnya ada didalam ruangan menyatu dengan bilas untuk gym. Agak ribet sih karena harus jalan agak jauh naik turun tangga. Tapi area bilasnya juga bagus, lengkap dengan kaca rias dan hair dryer. Sayang pas saya berenang jam 4an sore sudah tutup dan hujan jadi gabisa berlama2 di kolam. Yg bikin gondok saya kejebak hujan lebat disamping kolam bareng anak saya 2tahun, staff kolam padahal melihat dari dalam ruangan tapi ga ada inisiatif membantu (bawain payung atau apa gitu) padahal jelas dia melihat saya. Saya gabisa lari hujan2an karena bawa anak. Mungkin memang bukan tugasnya tapi alangkah baiknya kalo dia inisiatif membantu 😪 👎 Pas saya tanya dimana taro handuk basahnya juga dia ga sigap. Anak baru kali ya. Manajemen tolong ditraining lagi deh itu yg bagian jaga kolam Untuk restonya saya apreciate sih, terakhir saya breakfast disana sangat kecewa karena makanannya ga enak. Tapi pas cobain breakfast kemarin sangat kagum dengan perubahannya. Rasa makanan bener2 enak, nasi goreng dll bahkan kimbapnya pun dibikin dengan niat ga kaya dihotel2 lain. Memang ada beberapa makanan yg agak kurang tapi cuma beberapa, sisanya enak2 semua dan fresh. Saran untuk dessert lebih ditingkatin lagi rasanya 👌 Dan ketika saya breakfast chefnya pun menghampiri untuk tanya2 review makanannya, dia bilang buat masukan kedepannya. Salut chef 👌👌 Ohya hotel ini juga nempel langsung dengan mall gandaria city, jadi kalo mau ke mall tinggal turun ke lantai G dan belok kanan sampai ujung langsung ada pintu untuk ke mallnya. Securitynya juga ramah bgt disana. Overall puas bgt stay disini dan jadi salah satu favorit untuk liburan bareng keluarga 👍👍👍"

Pelayanan staf ramah dan profesional, dari check-in sampai check-out semua lancar. Breakfast-nya variatif dan enak banget, dari makanan lokal sampai western semua ada dan terjaga kualitasnya. Kolam renang dan gym juga oke, bikin staycation terasa lengkap. Untuk acara meeting atau event juga sering dipakai karena ballroom dan fasilitas MICE-nya besar dan well-managed. Harga memang premium, tapi sebanding sama kenyamanan, fasilitas, dan kemudahan aksesnya. Cocok banget buat business trip maupun family staycation di tengah kota."

"131.","Anna","3","2025-01-01","4","I went here for a symposium but didn’t spend a night. Meeting rooms were nice and clean, sound systems great, and the food was especially delicious. I give 3 stars for service because this hotel does not have a proper nursery/lactation room that is not a toilet. Would you eat your lunch inside a toilet? No, and neither would a baby. The female staff of the restaurant directed me instead to the disability toilet. It has a changing table, but again, NOT a lactation room (she didn’t even know what a lactation room was!). I thought “ruang laktasi” is already a common knowledge by now. Please, Sheraton, add a proper nursery room!!"
"132.","Michael Jeffrey","122","2025-05-01","5","Whenever we are in Jakarta, we always stay at the Sheraton Grand Jakarta Gandaria City Hotel. It is conveniently located in the Gandaria City shopping mall, and it is easy to get around to other locations in Jakarta. But most importantly, we stay there because of the extremely professional and friendly staff. They consistently strive to keep us satisfied and to anticipate our needs. We would like to especially call out Teddy, Chef in the Anigre restaurant. He is always checking with patrons to verify the quality of food and is willing to meet special individual requirements. We also appreciate the attention we receive from Melanie and Amir in the club lounge. They are always attentive to our special requests and do their best to make sure we enjoy our stay."

The staff were all truly wonderful. Longe served a full spread for dinner during cocktail hours. The breakfast was at a award winning buffet restaurant which should not be missed during your stay. The restaurant staff were all wonderful. The gym was spacious and well equipped. Pool was of good size and a kids pool as well. There are also 2 smallish kids play area on the pool floor. Linked to a very nice mall which would have everything you need. Would love to be back here again. Thanks to all the wonderful staff!"

"147.","deMon Gaming","3","2025-02-01","2","*DISCLAIMER, orang INDO tolong pakai google translate ya guys* terima kasih I stayed here on old and new - new year event 31-01 with my wife and my kid and her nanny.. 2 rooms with double the normal prices, we had a not so Grand breakfast, food tasted almost close to a standard, the breakfast room looks unprepared (they setup a normal ballroom with literally nothing much in it). Luckily, the band that setup the mood for the room really made it happened, the room shines because of them. Our room was kinda smelly, it has ammonia (from piss) smell here and there. (now now before you complaint, my kid didn't pee on the carpet or anywhere) I reported to the receptionist , yet no action taken.. just sorry.. Also, after we checked out we found out that my wife left her ring in the room, long short she contacted the hotel and the hotel didn't inform us whatsoever (she left her phone number to the hotel), so we rushed back to the hotel and I was pissed and called them , then they informed me that the ring was found. When we arrived, we waited 15 minutes ish or more for the hotel staff to give my wife ring back. Then we found out that the hotel was asking for ID card of my sister, cause the hotel was booked under her name XD. So, I told them that is my sister you are looking for, then I find my family identification card and showed the head of security Mr. Husein and then the proceed to procedure to give the ring back. 1. Hello, the info about the ring and the detailed of the ring was informed precisely from my wife via phone. 2. The position and the location was too informed by my wife on the phone. 3. After all that you still wanna ask for procedures, that is fine, but there is not one individiual who came forward to actually responsible and be present for this event, I had talk to 2 different staff on the phone. After 15 minutes in the lobby, my wife had to call the staff on the phone earlier, because they needed my sister ID card to proceed and give her ring back. Also, in the lobby we talked to another staff to confirm about this event, till they finally call their head security it seems ( didnt introduced himself too) and then I showed him my family ID card, and then we can finally go away from this silly Grand hotel. 5 mil/night for these? totally not worth it."

The food is good but getting a table for breakfast may take time - they have big tables that end up being for 2 while others have to wait. They should either allow sharing or change the tables. The organization of the ballrooms was problematic - the previous event going overtime which caused havoc on the next event."

"153.","Daniel Johansen","27","2025-01-01","5","I recently stayed at the Sheraton Hotel Gandaria City for business purposes, and overall, it was a great experience. The hotel’s lobby lounge is a fantastic place to unwind after a long day. With a DJ playing in the evening, the atmosphere is relaxing yet lively, and the food served there is truly amazing. From the moment I arrived, the welcome host greeted me with a warm smile and the signature Panjalu gesture, which is standard for a five-star hotel, but it was still a nice touch. The guest service team was also excellent and very attentive, ensuring all my needs were met throughout my stay. The room was comfortable, well-designed, and provided a great space to relax and work. However, the only downside to the hotel is the traffic in the surrounding area, which can be quite congested. This makes it less ideal for a vacation getaway, but if you're in town for business, the Sheraton Gandaria City is definitely a solid choice."

They even wrote a note for my stay and that's really sweet of them. This hotel also has a good location, it's connected to a mall which is a plus point (at least for me).

There are great culinary options here too, and make sure you check out the band at the lobby bar every evening! You won't be disappointed.

"176.","Jeffrey Handoko","11","2025-01-01","4","I went here last weekend with my wife to have a dinner at Anigre resto. We arrived early, around 5:15 PM. so we looked around at lobby hotel to spend time. I said to my wife that why the hotel was humid and hot', she said that she also felt the same. So we went to Lobby Lounge where was a live music session at that time. we went there to grab something to dink and place to wait and hopefully it would be cooler in the lounge. But, when we went in, we were surprised that the temperature in Lounge was worse than the Lobby. I asked to the staff, she said that this is the normal situation in Lounge everyday.. seriously? I can't think why someone would enjoy a chill moment in that Humid situation. So we decided not to have drinks there. I asked the receptionist staff about the temperature, she said that she also felt that the temperature was too hot. so I saw she talked with her colleagues about this. but I didn't wait and directly went to Anigre resto on UG floor by lift. Unfortunately, inside Anigre the temperature was also too hot and humid, so I asked about this to the staff. when I asked about this to the staff, other visitors beside me were also agreed with me that the temperature was too hot. The only place that felt colder were inside the toilet in Lobby and the aisle in front of lift. My suggestion is, please kindly fix this issue. Hotel is very much related to the comfort and hospitality matter. If the temperature is always like this, I would think twice to go back there again. it's a shame because we really like the food at Anigre and the vibes at Lounge. Thank you"

Interior: Untuk lobby sangat luas, walau pengunjung ramai, akan tetap terasa lega dan tidak sumpek. Design interiornya juga sangat baik, dan lux, serta rapih dan bersih. Untuk interior kamar sangat wangi, bersih dan tidak terasa sumpek. Semua sisi terlihat terawat dengan baik. Sinyal: Untuk sinyal mobile data agak buruk ya, terutama telkomsel. Tetapi untuk hotel dan in room wifi sangat cepat dan stabil. Check-in: Sangat smooth processnya, dan pelayanannya sangat baik, dilayaninoleh mas Yohanes Arbita. Club Lounge: Ketika menunggu kamar siap setelah check-in, saya dilayani oleh mba Meilani. Servicenya sangat baik, ramah, dan tanggap. Penanda: Tidak ada penanda Mohon bersihkan kamar, sehingga harus pengunjung yang memberikan notifikasi kepada petugas. Pelayanan: Ini adalah service experiences terbaik dari hotel sekelasnya. Semua pelayanan yang ada di Sheraton ini sangat baik, ramah, tanggap dan juga responsif. Saya sangat puas sekali dengan pelayanan yang diberikan dari semua pihak hotel kepada para penginap. Dibandingkan dengan hotel competitor dengan bintang sekelasnya, saya rasa hotel Sheraton Gandaria ini yang terbaik, terutama dalam pelayanan kepada para pelanggan. Atmosphere: Dikarenakan sepertinya hotel ini lebih segmentasi kepada Business Hotel, tetapi untuk para consumer yang tujuanya ingin menghabiskan akhir pekan bersama keluarga, hotel ini masih sangat cocok untuk diinapi, terutama untuk honeymoon, dll yang intimate. Harga: Dikarenakan semua aspek hingga experiences yang didapatkan consumer sangat baik, saya rasa harga yang ditawarkan hotel ini sangatlah worth it. The best and good job untuk Sheraton Gandaria"

The buffet spread was delicious and we even had the chef come up to ask what we would like to request for the next morning. The pool was a little hard to access - 2 flights of stairs while you’re wet and stringing the children along can be dangerous. The kids corner outside the gym was cute and cosy. Tried the gym which had a nice array of machines and threadmills were quite new. Had a shower outside the gym near the spa which was very convenient! The easy access to the mall was a star feature and so convenient for our family to have our meals and do some shopping. Overall, we enjoyed our stay very much and promise to be back!"

I used room service, the spa, the restaurant, the gym, and the concierge to book transportation. The location is great because the hotel is located right in the shopping mall, so you have easy access to restaurants, a grocery shop, banks, hair salons and shops.

Here are some highlights: Excellent Club Lounge: They have one of the best club lounges in the Asian region, offering high-quality foods and drinks. Modern and Well-Designed: The space is new and nice, with a really good concierge service. Spacious Rooms: The rooms are big and spacious, providing plenty of comfort. Robust Breakfast Options: For breakfast, you can choose between the club lounge or the main breakfast area, both offering a robust selection of options for people from anywhere. Convenient Location: The hotel is situated above a mall that has everything you need, including some really good restaurants, so you can easily walk around and explore. Nice Gym and Spa: The gym and spa are both well-equipped and pleasant. However, one area that needs improvement is the internet. Both in the rooms and the lounge, it was difficult to consistently get a high-speed internet connection."

I will inform you of the reson why. I have not been impressed with the Sheraton since our arrival. I booked the hotel becauae we were getting married on saturday and we wanted a 5 starhotel and it was between this hotel and the intercontinental at Pondok Indah. We intially had a problem paying as your receptionist said the card declined twice. This was embarrsiing as l know that there was no problem with the HSBC card. I said ok and paid with my debit card,stating that l would take it up with HSBC. I spoke to HSBC to find that yes it had been declined but not by HSBC,it was your EDC machine. I went out to buy champagne and used the HSBC credit card ,it worked at the shop l went to. I came back inside and asked your reception staff to try again but using another EDC machine,which he did. This time it worked perfectly and authuroised for other items l may want. This didnt make me happy as he could have tried the card in another machine on the intial payment. The next issue was your room aervice foos that evening. Nothing wrong with service nor with speed of service. The quality of food was not equal to the price paid. The burger was oily and sloppy, I did not eat all the food order as l couldnt. Then the breakfast was just not good. A toaater which jammed and had to put it through twice . I asked for english tea, l was brought a cup with hot water and a tea bag ! This is 5 star service? The food offered was not to my taste but hey thats my problem but it reflected on the meal l had last night. I asked the conceraige if they would bring my bottle of champage ,which l asked them to put in the fridge for the night, with 2 champamgne glasses and put them in my room at noon today in an ice bucket.when we returned to the hotel i found the bottle in a ice bucket with ice,excellent however no wine glasses,so we have to drink out of glass tumblers for our celebration. Finally, having stopped all around the world l cannot see how you justify 5 stars. The room is adeqate but thata all,its tired. The to find that the tea and coffee facilties is the same as you would find in a cheap bed and breakfast. We tried breakfast the following morning, poached eggs which were cold,and toast which wouldnt toast. Then the last issue is that with the laundry, can not say any more. I am sorry but being british l vote with myst feet,iI should not have to complain, if you have a 5 star rating it should be standard. On leaving your senuor managers would not even meet to discuss the issues. This stay has not been exceptional and certainly not what l would expect from a 5 star hotel. I would not give 1 star"

The breakfast is so so / not fresh. 3. The room smell terrible. 4. We got an early breakfast for takeaway and once the staff came with it the package was broken and suddenly pour the foods and coffee on the floor at the lobby and we had to wait for them another 30 mins to prepare again 🤷🏼‍♀️ 5. The good things are corridors and room still clean and doesn’t look old. The hotel is inside the Mall so its easy to go around. We are sorry will never come back again."

Whether it is with Michelle at the front desk, Novan at concierge, I immediately feel welcomed and at home. Additionally, the services offered are excellent. The food at the main restaurant or if you have access to the club lounge is wonderful, with varieties to meet anyone's needs. Room are clean and modern with excellent house keeping. The gym is also first rate. If you have time to relax see Bagus and Angee at the Spa for excellent treatments. The hotel is connected to a gigantic mall with lots to do and see.

"248.","mion HR","190","2022-01-01","3","First time, parkirnya ribet karena harus menyesuaikan mall which is sekitar jam10 baru dibuka. Sedangkan acara kantor mulai jm10 otomatis harus sudah dipersiapkan sebelum waktunya sedangkan parkirnya aja ribet, belibet. Kalau mau ke lantai 3 langsung harusnya parkir di B2, dan parkir itu yg langsung masuk hotel. Sedangkan parkiran B1 yang sudah ready hanya masuk mall, dan kalau pagi kudu ke hotel ini ya otomatis menjadi pengunjung pertama mall ini. Dan berkali2 kudu check-in di app pedulilindungi baik itu mau breakfast atau sekedar ambil barang ke parkiran. Cukup melelahkan. Untuk breakfastnya juga menurut saya kurang variatif, jadi kebanyakan sama dan kurang enak. Dan yang cukup buat saya kecewa sekelas hotel bintang 5 dengan tatanan serba marmer, menu makan malamnya selama 3 malam menginap, nasinya keras sekali seperti nasi aking sungguh tidak dapat dinikmati. Kelebihannya, kamarnya cukup luas dengan tema classic dan dilengkapi dengan bathtub. Untuk shower dan wc terpisah. Dan room service untuk pembersihan kamarnya cekatan, bersih, dan solutif. Goodjob 👍 semoga kedepannya Sheraton bisa memberi solusi termudah bagi tamu yang menginap dan lebih bervariasi lg dalam hal makanan."

"252.","Bull Dogg","962","2025-01-01","5","Updating the review from 2022. We stayed again in Oct 2024 and were absolutely amazed by the service level at this hotel. We were treated with the utmost courtesy and warmth from the minute we stepped out of the Silverbird. The staff has made every effort to make our stay enjoyable since, and for a 10-day stay that makes a world of difference. Thit time we enjoyed a suite and it was fantastic. All team members here make an effort to make your stay perfect. And it was. This is our new home away from home. Review from 2022: The Sheraton Grand Jakarta is located in the Gandaria City mall. The hotel has valet parking and direct access to the mall. All entrances to the hotel feature metal detectors and security staff, as well as xray equipment for purses and bags. The hotel was built in 2015 and features standard rooms from 38 sqm to 45 sqm, a lobby lounge, restaurants, a big gym and large outside pool area, and conference facilities. The reception area is very open and organized and directly opposite the reception is the lobby lounge and bar and a small counter where you can buy sandwiches and sweet snacks. We reviewed the lobby lounge separately. The hotel rooms are nice, with all the amenities you would expect. The bathroom isn’t very big but is well designed. The air condition is difficult to adjust, at least in our room. Even though it seems like the fan speed can be adjusted, it is operating at a high speed continuously, and it gets a bit tricky to control the temperature, after a while it is possible to get a nice climate in the room. The street noise is pretty loud, at least on the 9th floor where we were staying. It didn’t bother us much but if you are a light sleeper it might. Motorcycles are very loud in Jakarta and the traffic outside is intense pretty much all day and all night. The bed is very comfortable and so are the pillows and comforter. We slept incredibly well. We liked the mall access as it increases the dining options significantly when staying at this hotel. The gym is very good and features all the equipment you could possibly need, all very modern and well maintained. There is hand sanitizer throughout the gym and also sanitizer wipes. Towels and water are of course also provided. The staff is friendly and professional, and all our requests were met with a smile and a strong will to accommodate our requests. We enjoyed staying at the Sheraton Grand Jakarta Gandaria City and will consider it our preferred hotel at our next stay in Jakarta."
"253.","Pramuditha -","16","2025-01-01","5","Having staycation in the hotel after Eid Fitr. The lobby gave luxurious vibes, the reception was also helpful and friendly eventhough it was late check in. The room was spacious, we got upgrade to grand deluxe (thanks Marriot Bonvoy Membership). Breakfast was tasty with various menu. The chef and restaurant staffs were so friendly (esp. Chef Teddy who offered us Bakmi Godog and Carbonara for our daughter and Mbak Meissy-the morning shift staff). Bakmi Godog was so tasty, i guessed they used shrimp stock. We were also offered the take away meals after breaksfast. We gave 9.5 out of 10 for the breakfast. We also ordered bakwan jagung and fresh juices in room dining service, our daughter really loved the bakwan jagung. The location is so strategic, there’s a connecting door in Ground Level to Gancit Mall. We have visited other Sheraton Hotels, but this Sheraton hotel is the most modern and luxurious hotel. For suggestion, room amenities (esp. sandals) could be upgraded (compared to other 5 stars hotel, Sheraton’s quite was mediocre). And for kids, we think that the hotel may provide kids club (there was a pop up kids club, i think it’s temporary due to Eid Season), and also kids cutlery in restaurant (we have confirmed that they provide it but must be requested first). There was a minor problem in our room’s shower faucet but since it was minor, we just informed it to the staff and they responsed quickly. Overall, it was a pleasant stay and would like to come back. Thank you!"

Located within the vicinity of Gandaria City, it’s very convenient to get food, drinks, grocery and shopping. I had informed the staff about my birthday celebration at the hotel, so they kindly decorated the room, a personalized card and also a slice of cake. Kudos to the CRO team Fadol, Vanisa, Salina and also Miranda. From the check in process, everything was smooth sailing. The room allocated to me was in a high floor, 19th overlooking the city, it was on the floor of the executive lounge but I wasn’t eligible for lounge visit. The room was spacious, nice bathroom and amenities. We didn’t try the breakfast but instead chose to check out the cafes around the area. You can also easily order GrabFood. Overall I would come back and stay again when I visit Jakarta."

Kalo kesini staycation d hotel dan ke mall juga cukup, ada bathtub juga di kamar mandi nya.. Yg agak kurang : 1. Parkir di info dibawah oleh satpam di lantai sekian (info disampaikan o/ satpam sdh benar)tapi tulisan di jalan saat parkir mengarahkan ke lantai lain jadi ambigu, lalu di lantai yg disebutkan di tutup dg traffic cone sehingga bikin ga ngeh dan sy hrs turun dlu dr mobil untuk pindahin cone nya. Saran sy di lantai yg sdh tdk dijadikan parkiran dituliskan kalo parkir pindah ke bawah dan cone di lantai yg benar tdk tertutup (krn saat sy naik pun ad org lain yg jg maubke hotel akhirnya salah smpe naik ksana) 2.

We have been to several other hotels and restaurants in Jakarta, even other from same chain, but we keep returning here. Why? Well the staff is amazingly friendly, very well trained and they do apply what they are thought. That makes you feel safe and really welcome. The food is also great, and a good selection to choose from. They also have a nice gym and swimming pool, and all installations is kept clean and well maintained. The location is also convenient as it is attached to Gandaria mall."

When I was hovering over the food stations at the breakfast buffet, the staff came up to me and asked if I needed help/ recommendations. Even had my soap bottles in my room displayed nicely on a presentation napkin by Iwan and Landu. Loved the comfy bed and delicious food. Very enjoyable stay!"
"279.","Zairynn Yazmi","44","2023-01-01","5","What an amazing hotel to stay in South Jakarta. While its proximity to Gandaria City Mall is great ( literally at its doorstep), it's the people, services, and cleanliness that made my stay excellent. Check in/out was seamless; room is spacious and clean - plenty has been said about this. Shout out to the housekeeping team for leaving surprises in the form of towel arts, bath salts and messages everytime i came back to the room - it feels like a treasure hunt and make the stay that much fun. I think the unsung hero of this hotel is its amazing pillows! I would love these pillows home. Its soft, and fluffy and guaranteed to make you have a good night rest."
"280.","Vivi Azwar","68","2023-01-01","5","The location is close to Gandaria City Mall, very easy to find food or shopping. The meeting room seems a bit stuffy because it's closed and hasn't been used before. The hotel is clean, the staff is friendly, the food has a lot of variety from Indonesian, Japanese, Korean food, and tastes very delicious. A large hotel room is equipped with a bath tub, even for a very large twin bed, you can invite the family. Family friendly hotel !!!"

The delicious dining (breakfast) food options exceeded my expectations, offering a delightful variety that catered to every preference, special kudos for Chef Anton and the Anigre team.

"282.","Chris Chong","42","2025-01-01","5","Well done! Sheraton! Everything was perfect! Sheraton delights me in every way! From day 1, there was a surprise candy platter, attentive and caring attendants and chef in the breakfast table, expert housekeeper who organise my toiletries and make up in an “Marie Kondo” manner, to the macarons during check out! Room service meals were delicious too! Rooms were clean and nicely decorated. Simply wonderful! Located within a very larger shopping mall with lots of eateries and shopping."
"283.","Apri Setyawan P","136","2022-01-01","4","Conference room cukup luas, dan fleksible menampung peserta conference. Dengan luas 2 ruangan dapat setting roundtable hingga 15 table dengan kapasitas setiap tablenya 6 peserta. Soundsystem lembut tdk ada feedback Akses pintu confereence room, screen proyector, panggung, backdrop,. AC dingin banget, asli butuh jaket biar ga masuk angin. Akses masuk ribet kalau bawa mobil sendiri, karena parkirnya di basement gedung yg jadi satu sama mall gandaria city, sebenarnya ada pintu masuk dari mall tapi selalu terkunci jadi kalau mau masuk ke hotel harus keluar mall/gedung dulu baru masuk lagi ke loby hotel. Lumayan jauh juga muternya bikin pegel kaki. Akses lift aman kalau nginep karena pakau kartu, jadi kalau tidak punya kartu akses tidak bisa naik ke lantai kamar hotel. Lorong hotel berkarpet dan ga berisik jadi kalau nginep buat istirahat sih bisa nyaman ga keganggu suara langkah kaki atau suara roda koper pengunjung lain."

"293.","Dewi Zulfana","557","2024-01-01","2","Lokasi strategis dan stadard bintang 5. Saran : kartu kamar untuk listrik dan kartu akses lift adalah kartu yg sama / tidak berbeda jadi tidak ribet untuk ganti2 atau update kartu. Kemudian security yg bertugas di pintu masuk, hanya khusus membuka orang2 yg kelihatan berduit/mobil bagus untuk dapat uang tip seharusnya jika pelayanan ini harus disamakan 🙏🏻"
"294.","Juju","94","2024-01-01","5","It is very convenient as it is connected to Gandria City Mall. For breakfast, panini sandwiches are also made it right now. However, there is a road and a large mosque right in front of the hotel, so it is noisy at dawn. But everyone was friendly and the service was good."
"295.","Nathania Hermawan Liem","22","2025-01-01","1","Stayed for one night at Sheraton, there is a leakage on the ceiling of the luggage rack. It caused the inside of my luggage to be wet and some of my medicine got wet, luckily it was inside a plastic bag so I could quickly pat it dry before I reported it to the guest service, but there is no sense of urgency from the hotel's part & when one of the managers came to check, she did not offer any concrete solution. As a member of marriot bonvoy staying at a marriott hotel, the quality of the hotel disappoint us. I personally would never come back."
"296.","Pio San","25","2025-01-01","5","I stay in this Hotel not the first time. - Rooms are comparing to other Hotels very large. Room is clean and comfortable. The bed linen are wonderful soft.👍 - Noise cancelation of the windows is not really good, but that's the only disturbing thing in the room. - The Lounge has a great choice of cold and warm food, offer for Dinner. Comparing to Most of the other Marriott Lounges, this Lounge is most excellent choise. Also the breakfast Buffett has a great choice of items. You will surly find something delicious here. - The staff is absolutely kind and helpfull and when youn are not usend of bahasa as foreigner ist no problem to comunicate with. - Swimmingpool is great also the gym. However you have to know, that this Hotel is not cheap but of course the price is worth the stay when you want to have a 5 star stay. Additionaly i have to say that this Hotel is integrated in the Gandaria shopping Mall. So it is very convienient for having shopping fun. Terima kasih"

The staff went above and beyond to ensure my comfort and satisfaction throughout my stay, attending to every request with promptness and professionalism. The dining experience was a culinary delight, with a diverse selection of delectable dishes that tantalized my taste buds. The hotel's amenities, including the state-of-the-art fitness center and luxurious spa, provided the perfect balance of relaxation and rejuvenation.

"304.","Agustina Situmorang","525","2024-01-01","4","Fasilitas hotel yang sangat lengkap, lokasi strategis, terdapat akses langsung ke Mall Gandaria City (tapi selama pandemi ditutup) jadi harus keluar dari Mall lalu masuk dari Lobby Utama Hotel (masih bersebelahan). Penerapan protokol pencegahan penyebaran Covid-19 di hotel ini lumayan baik, terutama di resto untuk breakfast tamu tidak diperkenankan untuk mengambil menu sendiri. Tamu hotel akan order berdasarkan menu yang bisa kita akses melalui scan barcode. Untuk makanan dan minuman sangat bervariasi. Hanya saja untuk standard hotel bintang 5 fitness centernya menurut saya biasa saja, viewnya juga tidak menarik, hanya disudut ruangan mengarah ke kolam renang. Tapi personal trainernya oke dan sangat membantu."

"306.","Sandi AA","403","2023-01-01","5","Desain kamarnya tidak gloomy, cukup cerah dan ukurannya pas, kamar mandi, amenitiesnya juga pas sesuai kebutuhan. Deposit box tersedia. Lebih cocok untuk short stay ataupun business purpose. Televisinya belum bisa untuk menonton youtube ataupun netflix dan sejenisnya. Untuk kursi kerjanya nyaman, empuk. Namun sayangnya mejanya kaca, tidak semua mouse bisa. Seandainya ada desk mat atau mejnya kayu akan lebih baik. Untuk breakfast rasa makanannya enak, banyak pilihannya termasuk indomie. Tersedia akses ke mall gancit ga jauh dari lift menuju kamar. Alat-alat gymnya variatif, spa pun juga tersedia walaupun lumayan mahal. Yang paling saya ingat, ada karya Rudi Mantofani yang dipakai jadi cover album Sheila On 7 07 Des yang terletak di sebrang Anigree"

Oak wood gtu. Mantep sih ini. Yang paling gue suka dari sharton yaitu makanannya yang bervariasi. Terakhir kesana ada makanan dari india, korea, western gtu. Tapi dulu ada bebek panggang, tapi kemaren cuma ada ayam panggang. Trus ada ice cream nya juga. Banyak pilihan buah, desert, ada salmonnya juga. Pesen teh english breakfast, di kasihnya air panas + teh (ga langsung di seduh). Ditawarin decrepes, tapi nyampenya 15 menit kemudian. Pas proses cekinnya resepsionisnya agak ga jutek tapi ga ramah juga. Jadi B aja. Trus masalah alas setrikaannya ga banget 😭. Cuma di lapisin sehelai kain dan mudah copot. Harusnya sih bisa lebih bagus yaa sekelas hotel bintang 5 di jakarta."

Can't accumulate Bonvoy Points on a corporate stay... Ok Room won't be ready for a few hours... Ok Refrigerator is not chilling drinks... Ok Ice bucket was too small to chill drinks. May I have a larger one. Ok If I pay top dollar for a five star experience, then I expect a better than average experience. The staff were apologetic and amazingly helpful, however the relentless assault of dissapointments appeared more systemic that individual."

"324.","yanxin","363","2023-01-01","5","I was here for a working event in Gandaria Mall and since there is direct access to the mall from the hotel, it was very convenient for our purposes. Our room is well equipped with amenities and had panoramic views through the floor-to-ceiling windows. The bed is super soft, and I slumbered like a baby every night. My only nit-pick was that the aircon seems slow to respond to temperature adjustments. In the morning, I mostly had the pool all to myself when I swam laps for more than an hour. There is also a 24h gym on the same floor. The breakfast buffet spread is impressive, and the food is fantastic. I’ve stayed in many high-end hotels across the globe and the food here easily ranks as one of the best in terms of taste and variety. The people at this hotel left a deep impression. From the lobby all the way down to its kitchen staff, everyone was always helpful and polite. During our stay, we were even left a hand-written note of thanks by room service, a personal touch that was appreciated by my uncle and me. On occasions, I also had the pleasure of speaking with the hotel GM, Mr Basha. When our company event encountered unprecedented issues, he was not only generous in offering us temporary storage but also kind enough to help us tackle the difficult situation by utilising his network of connections in the city. We’re glad we stayed in this hotel and would definitely recommend it to others looking for a comfortable stay in Jakarta!"

"326.","Arifien M.","1739","2021-01-01","3","Lokasi cukup baik. Pelayanan baik. Kamar cukup nyaman. Dengan amenities cukup lengkap. Pelayanan housekeeping bisa lebih baik lagi, agar tidak miss-com lagi. Tanda kiblat di kamar sampe skrg belum nemu dimana posisinya, untung ada aplikasi di HP jadi terbantu. Mengenai sarapan pagi di resto seharusnya ada optional buat dibawa ke kamar, apalagi jumlah seat terbatas karena phisical distancing, karena jika badan kita kurang fit agak riskan juga jika harus berkerumun di resto. Yang bikin kurang nyaman adalah di hari berikutnya dimana saat breakfast dibagi 3 batch, tapi aturan hotel tidak ketat. Dimana saat saya di batch 3/ terakhir saat masuk masih banyak pengunjung batch ke 2 sebelumnya. Jadinya SAMA AJA RAMAI DAN TIDAK EFEKTIF. Kemungkinan saya akan pikir2 lagi akan menginap di hotel ini jika aturannya begini."

I did arrive earlier than check in time then the receptionist told me to wait for another 30 mins to 1 hour. I’ll back an hour later then they said to wait again for another 20 minutes. Meanwhile I saw the other guests can have an early check in as same time as I arrived, when I asked bout it, the receptionist said because I booked bigger room. Guess in here they treat standard room better than bigger room. Maybe tips for you guys who wants to stay here later, just order the standard deluxe room, instead of bigger room 🙂🥲"

"341.","Mr. R","252","2022-01-01","3","Kurang worth it kalau untuk hotel bintang 5 dengan harga di atas 2 juta per malam. Toiletteriesnya below expectation (kaya hotel kelas bintang 3), belum pakai smart TV, dan staffnya kurang attentive & responsive. Satu-satunya nilai plus adalah karena nempel dengan Gandaria City Mall."

"346.","Ananda Wondo","19","2022-01-01","5","Adjoining Gandaria City Mall and surrounded by office towers, Sheraton Grand Jakarta is one of the perfect destinations in Jakarta for a stay of both leisure and business trips. Speaking of the service, all the staff were very helpful with a hospitable attitude. The room is spacious with a marble bathroom. My stay was including breakfast in an elegant and warm setting with a high ceiling, floor-to-ceiling windows, and plenty of natural daylight. The breakfast menu was quite a lot and the service from the staff at Anigre was attentive. The gym is pretty spacious with state-of-the-art equipment and a refreshing pool."

Sarapan lengkap menu dari mancanegara, rasa cukup baik, hanya saja beberapa menu yang kurang cocok dilidah saya, seperti cake yang agak keras dan daging terlalu asin, tapi banyak juga menu lainnya yang enak, resto cukup luas untuk menampung tamu. Staff ramah dan sigap memberikan bantuan."

Untuk sarapannya sendiri,hampir sama saja seperti hotel2 sekelasnya.enak2 tapi tidak ada yg istimewa. Fasilitas gym disini juga termasuk komplit.ada petugas yg bisa membantu kita bila kesulitan menggunakan alat2nya"

This my wife's first time to visit Jakarta, so I just wanted her to relax and enjoy there and chose this hotel which is located in central Jakarta and next to the big shopping mall Gandaria city mall. However, this was more than that. Nice cozy room, comfortable swimming pool which can be used from 6 A.M to 10 P.M, and especially the morning buffet was awesome. You might love to enjoy local cuisine in the outside of the hotel even if it's in the morning, but it's worth trying."
"353.","Firdom Tv","7","2023-01-01","2","Hotelnya memang bagus hanya saja ada yg harus dibenahi yaitu tentang akses dari parkir menuju hotel pada jam sebelum jam 6 pagi. Karna rutenya sangat menyusahkan. Perlu diingat yang ke hotel bukan saja yang menginap melainkan juga para pekerja kreatif sepertu fotografer, videografer dan Makeup Artist. Harap dipertimbangkan untuk dibuka akses yang lebih memudahkan kami para pekerja kreatif mengingat banyaknya barang bawaan yang kami bawa dalam pekerjaan kami. Terima kasih."

I didn't request any specific perks and I didn't expect anything at all initially. But we were very surprised when we find that our room is already decorated with a lovely towel swan and rose petals decoration! Adding to that, couple hours after we check in, the lovely staff gives us a very delicious chocolate cake! Thank you Sheraton Gandaria City for making our stay memorable and pleasant, we truly enjoyed our time! 5 Star!"

"361.","Bobby Sukma P.","182","2023-01-01","5","Great hotel. I stayed here in May 2022. Health protocol are implemented properly such as temperature check, hand sanitizer at several points, etc. The lobby of this hotel is big and luxurious. This hotel provides direct access to the Gandaria City mall, along the hallway leading to the mall access there are also interesting paintings. The hotel also provides a ballroom for events. Being a club level guest I am amazed with the service of the hotel staff starting from check in. I was directed to the Club Lounge and helped by the porter to carry my luggage. Arriving at the Club Lounge, I was assisted in the check-in process by the receptionist accompanied by a warm tea. The check-in process was fast and I was given the leeway to check out until 3pm. At the Club Lounge, I get 3 meals a day : breakfast, all day snacks, and evening cocktails. The Club Lounge is quite large with a cool view since it is on the top floor and has a modern luxury interior design. I got a room on the 20th floor, the room is spacious with facilities including: large bed with reading light, floor to ceiling window with a cool view, tv, work desk, wardrobe, safe deposit box, minibar with refrigerator (which is unique because there is a machine French press coffee) and many more. The bed is very comfortable. The bathroom in this room is also spacious with a nice design, there is a bathtub, toilet, rain shower, complete amenities. The minus was I was requesting for a shaver and extra shower gel, shampoo, and conditioner but the service is a bit slow, it took about 15 minutes to be delivered to my room. In the evening I was present at the evening cocktail, the food and drinks were complete and varied, we could request a cocktail as desired. In the morning I tried breakfast, the menu is complete and in my opinion it’s more luxurious than hotel breakfasts in general. All the food tastes good. Another facility that I tried at this hotel is the swimming pool, the pool is quite large and there is a special pool for children too. The changing room and toilet are big and fragrant. And what I like is the design of the private shower because it has complete amenities and towels. I am very grateful to all the hotel staff, especially Theresia and Bayu for the great service that made my stay unforgettable. Overall this hotel is very good and recommended👍🏻"
"362.","Anjan Kumar Sinha","466","2023-01-01","4","The hotel is located in a good surrounding,with a Mall(with plenty of shopping places and eateries). Rooms are average, but with poor wifi connectivity inside the room. There are plenty of options for breakfast, but you need to be careful if you don't eat beef; it is very difficult to find out if a particular non Veg dosen't contain beef- nothing written not the staff are confidently able to confirm. I opted to be Vegan."
"363.","Steven Carlo","305","2024-01-01","5","updated: Juli 23 This is our third stay at Sheraton gandaria. check in was handled by Cynthia, which was very standard. i would say just a tad bit standard for a Sheraton receptionist. Nothing special, just not up quite Sheraton like. maybe because it was a busy noon. as a gold elite member, we were upgraded to a Larger guest room. which was ok. The room surprisingly has no written greetings for us. Unlike the other Marriots, and the first two stays at Sheraton, we got written greetings, and in the past also greetings on the mirror too we booked the side by side family package for one night only on July 11th to July 12th. we stayed at 907. Breakfast was another story, it just got better and better. wow, the food, the service, the ambience. all excellent. Thank you very much for the service by Mr. Anton and Mr, Syahrul at breakfast. We will not forget the friendliness and service you have provided us. Also thank you to Meysi who was very friendly to my youngest daughter ————————————————- been wanting to stay at sheraton gandaria for many years now, finally got the chance to do it. stayed for two nights, first night at april 4th 2022 and second night at april 9th 2002 lets talk about the first night at april 4th 2022 checked in was very fast, by very friendly mr. emyr. as a silver elite member we got upgraded to SUITE. wow. thank you. we really appreciate it. the rooms were better than we expected. everything was so perfect, the beds, the working table and chair. the bathtub, the shower, toilet, everything was spot clean. the sofa wasnt stained. towels were perfect white. WOW. this is what a 5 star hotel should be. the food at club lounge was also very nice. was greeted by the very friendly Ms. Eiffel. and two thumbs up for by Mr Reynaldo who took time to explain the drinks and the food. also recommended me the Dilmar Lychee iced tea, which i still consume at home till this day. BTW, the pan smeared snapper was so delicious. breakfast at anigre was just so special. theres no complaints here. all praise. we also had in room dining which was excellent. the second time we stayed here, we did not get a room upgrade, as we redeemed our marriot points vto get the room. the standard room is still very very clean. We also had dinner buffet for 8 people at anigre. Wow, the quality of the food is unheard of. The endless sashimis and probably the best sop buntut in town i will not miss the chance to stay here in the future. an excellent hotel."

"376.","muhammad firmansyah","68","2022-01-01","5","check in on Sundays so that the hotel conditions are not too crowded compared to checking in on Saturdays, maybe those who are on vacation while taking advantage of the weekend have already checked out, seen at check-in the atmosphere of the hotel lobby is very crowded with guests checking out. the size of the room is quite spacious with a large glass window so that the view out feels relieved and good, the bathroom is equipped with a large and deep bathup that adds comfort when bathing in hot water and also a separate shower room. on the side of the bathup there is a clear glass into the room and is equipped with automatic curtains with just the press of a button. a large size mattress equipped with 4 pillows that are soft and very comfortable so that it makes a very high-quality rest, in the room there is also a work desk with a high speed internet connection so it is very helpful during the current pandemic atmosphere for working from hotels and also online school children greatly helped. public swimming pool facilities can be used but are limited to a maximum of 40 people at a time, when we stayed there were not too many guests swimming so it was very comfortable and felt safe. the location of the hotel which is integrated with the Gandaria City mall so it is very easy in terms of looking for dinner or just for window shopping. at breakfast the food menu is very varied with the right and delicious flavors of cuisine, overall it is very worth it to stay at this hotel, either for a staycation with family or looking for another atmosphere when working from home arrangements at this time"

"422.","Genta","1457","2024-01-01","5","My stay at Sheraton Grand Jakarta, Gandaria City, in the King Suite, offered a harmonious blend of indulgence and subtle nuances within this urban retreat, secured at the rate of Rp3,865,708. Suite Serenity: The King Suite at Sheraton Grand Jakarta unfolded as a generously spacious haven, ensuring a luxurious and comfortable retreat within the vibrant urban landscape of Jakarta. The room's expansive dimensions contributed to an enhanced sense of comfort, while the carefully curated amenities added a touch of opulence to the overall experience. Artistry and Luxe in the Lounge: A standout highlight of the stay was undoubtedly the Executive Lounge, an exquisitely designed space that seamlessly blended artistic flair with a luxurious ambiance. The lounge experience was elevated by the exceptional quality of coffee, and both the breakfast and dinner offerings showcased culinary excellence, providing guests with a refined and delightful dining experience. Dated Quarters and Divergent Vibes: While the King Suite exuded comfort, a discernible downside was the perceptible aging of certain elements within the room, contributing to a sense of dated charm. However, the Executive Lounge, with its opulent design and culinary offerings, stood as a stark contrast, creating a divergence in ambiance between the accommodation and the common areas. Crowded Lobby Dynamics: Navigating through the lobby proved to be a bustling and dynamic experience, with a discernible crowd adding to the vibrant atmosphere. The presence of numerous events within the hotel premises might explain the lively lobby dynamics. While this vibrancy contributes to the hotel's dynamic character, it might be overwhelming for those seeking a more serene check-in or check-out process. In summary, Sheraton Grand Jakarta, Gandaria City, provided a stay marked by nuanced experiences. The King Suite, with its expansive dimensions, offered a luxurious retreat, although some elements hinted at aging. The Executive Lounge, a culinary and artistic haven, stood out despite a contrast in ambiance. The bustling lobby dynamics, while dynamic, added layers of complexity to the overall stay, contributing to the hotel's vibrant character."

Tolong pegawainya dilatih lagi supaya tetap fokus mendaftarkan parkir bagi pengunjung yg menginap membawa kendaraan, saya baru saja mau keluar parkiran motor tetapi tidak bisa karena emoney yg didaftarkan pegawai hotel adalah kendaraan mobil. Masalahnya saya bukan hanya sejam 2 jam parkir, tapi sudah 2 hari dan argo parkir pastinya mahal dan ini murni kesalahan pihak hotel, mau ngga mau saya harus naik lagi ke hotel utk revisi pendaftaran parkir dan jaraknya masyaAllah jauh banget, saya lari pp aja sudah 30 menit apalagi kalau jalan bisa satu jam pp. Parahnya lagi dari sekian banyaknya pegawai TIDAK ADA SATUPUN yg mengucapkan MAAF atas kelalalian tim mereka sendiri (TERMASUK CAPTAINNYA). Saya tanya petugas parkir ternyata memang kejadiannya sangat sering pihak hotel salah input karena HUMAN ERROR, tepat sebelum saya juga ada yg pegawainya salah menuliskan 1 huruf plat nomornya. Jujur sangat disayangkan, petugas restoran sudah sangat ramah memberikan pelayanan dgn harapan reviewnya bagus tapi dijatuhkan sama pegawai resepsionis bagiaj pendaftaran parkir yg tidak fokus bekerja! Saya harap pihak hotel bisa lebih berbenah agar tidak ada pengunjung lagi yang dirugikan"

"487.","Maria","1","2025-05-21","1","Pengalaman Tidak Menyenangkan di Area Kolam Renang Saya menginap di Sheraton dan berkesempatan menggunakan kolam renang sambil mengenakan pakaian aktif (atasan olahraga dan legging yang cukup ketat). Pakaiannya terasa nyaman dan menurut saya masih pantas. Namun, saya juga memahami bahwa hal tersebut mungkin tidak sepenuhnya sesuai dengan aturan berpakaian, jadi sebelum masuk, saya bertanya kepada anggota staf wanita di gerbang olahraga apakah hal tersebut diperbolehkan. Dia menyebutkan tidak ada batasan dan mengizinkan saya masuk tanpa masalah. Saat aku sedang berenang, anggota staf yang sama mendekatiku dan mengatakan bahwa pakaianku “tidak diperbolehkan karena ada anggota platinum yang mengeluh.” Saya segera meminta maaf dan berkata saya akan segera keluar dari kolam. Namun dia melanjutkan, Ini adalah peringatan dari anggota platinum. Mereka adalah tamu tetap di sini dan mengatakan kamu tidak boleh memakai itu. Pada saat itu, saya merasa sangat terpojok. Status “anggota platinum” disebutkan berulang kali, seolah-olah itu saja yang membenarkan teguran tersebut — bukan karena kebijakan hotel yang dikomunikasikan dengan jelas. Saya kecewa dengan cara pesan itu disampaikan. Jika terdapat peraturan khusus mengenai pakaian renang, staf harus mengkomunikasikannya secara objektif dan konsisten berdasarkan kebijakan hotel. Kami memahami sepenuhnya bahwa hotel memiliki aturannya sendiri, namun dalam kasus ini, staf mendasarkan teguran tersebut pada keluhan tamu dan status loyalitas mereka, yang dirasa tidak pantas. Saya percaya bahwa setiap tamu, apapun status keanggotaannya, berhak diperlakukan dengan sopan dan profesional. Saya berharap Sheraton dapat meningkatkan standar komunikasi dan layanan internal sehingga semua tamu — terlepas dari tingkat keanggotaannya — merasa dihormati dan diperlakukan secara adil."
"488.","Nam Trân","15","2025-05-21","1","Pelayanannya sangat buruk, hotelnya sangat buruk dalam hal pelayanan, kartu kredit Vietnam tidak bisa digunakan, tetapi uangnya tetap dipotong dari rekening kartu saya dan kemudian staf menanganinya dengan buruk."
"489.","Andy Lee","82","2025-06-21","1","Sungguh memalukan dan sangat mengecewakan. Berikut terjemahan teks Anda ke dalam bahasa Inggris yang fasih dan profesional: Penginapan yang Benar-Benar Memalukan dan Mengecewakan Penginapan saya baru-baru ini di Sheraton Gandaria City sungguh memalukan dan mengecewakan. Saya tiba larut malam untuk check-in, tetapi merasa sama sekali tidak dikenali dan tidak dihargai oleh staf resepsionis, terutama Shafina. Saat check-in, saya diberitahu bahwa tidak ada kamar suite yang tersedia—hanya kamar yang lebih besar yang diperuntukkan bagi perokok, dan selain itu hanya kamar standar yang saya pesan sebelumnya. Karena penasaran, saya memeriksa aplikasi Marriott dan melihat bahwa kamar Suite ternyata tersedia. Ketika saya bertanya lagi, ia menjawab bahwa mungkin ada ketidakcocokan antara aplikasi dan ketersediaan sebenarnya. Tidak masalah. Tetapi kemudian saya memeriksa lagi dan melihat bahwa bahkan kamar di atas Junior Suite pun tersedia. Ketika saya bertanya tentang itu, ia mengatakan saya bisa menginap di salah satunya dengan tambahan Rp2,5 juta—tetapi ia bisa menawarkan diskon 50%, sehingga menjadi Rp1,25 juta. Saya menolak dan memutuskan untuk melanjutkan dengan kamar saya yang lama. Saya bahkan menekankan bahwa saya adalah Anggota Titanium, dan dia menjawab bahwa Anggota Titanium hanya berhak atas peningkatan hingga Junior Suite. Hal ini menimbulkan pertanyaan serius—mengapa Anggota Titanium diperlakukan seperti ini? Bukankah salah satu manfaat utama status Titanium Elite adalah peningkatan gratis, termasuk ke suite, jika tersedia? Jadi, yang mana? Apakah suite hanya tersedia dengan biaya tambahan, atau memang tidak tersedia? Rasanya tidak konsisten, terutama karena teman saya pernah mendapatkan peningkatan ke Presidential Suite, dan saya sendiri pernah mendapatkan peningkatan ke Presidential Suite di lokasi Sheraton lainnya. Mungkinkah karena saya menggunakan poin kali ini sehingga saya dibatasi? Jika ya, apa gunanya menjadi bagian dari Marriott Bonvoy? Apakah kita mendapatkan poin tanpa benar-benar menginap? Jika tidak, mengapa status saya tidak dihormati? Kunjungan ini sungguh mengecewakan. Bahkan tidak ada kartu ucapan selamat datang yang menyatakan Keanggotaan Elite saya. Kerja bagus—tidak akan ada kunjungan berikutnya."
"490.","Ian Greenwood","92","2025-01-21","1","Ini sebagai tanggapan atas tawaran makan gratis untuk 4 orang. Kami berdua memperhatikan komentar Anda, namun pada kesempatan ini kami tidak akan menerima tawaran Anda. Saya akan memberi tahu Anda alasannya. Saya tidak terkesan dengan Sheraton sejak kedatangan kami. Saya memesan hotel ini karena kami akan menikah pada hari Sabtu dan kami menginginkan hotel bintang 5 dan letaknya di antara hotel ini dan Intercontinental di Pondok Indah. Awalnya kami mengalami masalah saat membayar karena resepsionis Anda mengatakan kartu Anda ditolak dua kali. Ini memalukan karena saya tahu tidak ada masalah dengan kartu HSBC. Saya bilang oke dan membayar dengan kartu debit saya, menyatakan bahwa saya akan membicarakannya dengan HSBC. Saya berbicara dengan HSBC dan mengetahui bahwa ya, kartu itu ditolak tetapi bukan oleh HSBC, melainkan oleh mesin EDC Anda. Saya pergi keluar untuk membeli sampanye dan menggunakan kartu kredit HSBC, kartu itu berfungsi di toko yang saya kunjungi. Saya kembali ke dalam dan meminta staf resepsionis untuk mencoba lagi tetapi menggunakan mesin EDC lain, dan dia melakukannya. Kali ini berfungsi dengan sempurna dan resmi untuk barang lain yang mungkin saya inginkan. Hal ini tidak membuat saya senang karena dia bisa saja mencoba kartu tersebut di mesin lain pada pembayaran awal. Masalah berikutnya adalah layanan kamar Anda yang buruk malam itu. Tidak ada yang salah dengan layanan maupun kecepatan layanan. Kualitas makanan tidak sebanding dengan harga yang dibayarkan. Burgernya berminyak dan lembek, saya tidak menghabiskan semua pesanan makanan karena saya tidak bisa. Lalu sarapannya tidak enak. Pemanggang roti yang macet dan harus dipanaskan dua kali. Saya meminta teh Inggris, dan saya diberi secangkir air panas dan kantong teh! Ini layanan bintang 5? Makanan yang ditawarkan tidak sesuai dengan selera saya, tetapi hei, itu masalah saya, tetapi itu tercermin pada makanan yang saya makan tadi malam. Saya bertanya kepada petugas apakah mereka bisa membawakan sebotol sampanye saya, yang saya minta mereka taruh di kulkas semalaman, dengan 2 gelas sampanye dan menaruhnya di kamar saya siang ini dalam ember es. Ketika kami kembali ke hotel, saya menemukan botol itu di dalam ember es dengan es, luar biasa tetapi tidak ada gelas anggur, jadi kami harus minum dari gelas kaca untuk perayaan kami. Akhirnya, setelah berhenti di seluruh dunia, saya tidak mengerti bagaimana Anda membenarkan 5 bintang. Kamarnya memadai tetapi hanya itu saja, sudah usang. Kemudian menemukan bahwa fasilitas teh dan kopi sama seperti yang akan Anda temukan di bed and breakfast murah. Kami mencoba sarapan keesokan paginya, telur rebus yang dingin, dan roti panggang yang tidak bisa dipanggang. Lalu masalah terakhir adalah dengan binatu, tidak bisa berkata apa-apa lagi. Saya minta maaf tetapi sebagai orang Inggris, saya memilih dengan kaki saya, saya seharusnya tidak perlu mengeluh, jika Anda memiliki peringkat bintang 5, itu seharusnya standar. Saat meninggalkan hotel, manajer senior Anda bahkan tidak mau bertemu untuk membahas masalah tersebut. Penginapan ini tidak luar biasa dan tentu saja tidak seperti yang saya harapkan dari hotel bintang 5. Saya tidak akan memberi 1 bintang."
"491.","Nathania Hermawan Liem","22","2025-01-21","1","Menginap semalam di Sheraton, ada kebocoran di langit-langit rak bagasi. Hal itu menyebabkan bagian dalam bagasi saya basah dan beberapa obat saya basah. Untungnya, obat-obatan saya ada di dalam kantong plastik sehingga saya bisa segera mengeringkannya sebelum melaporkannya ke layanan tamu. Namun, tidak ada rasa urgensi dari pihak hotel, dan ketika salah satu manajer datang untuk memeriksa, ia tidak menawarkan solusi konkret. Sebagai anggota Marriott Bonvoy yang menginap di hotel Marriott, kualitas hotel ini mengecewakan kami. Saya pribadi tidak akan pernah kembali."

Pintu kamar mandi tidak mau terbuka setelah dikunci. Rupanya, ini bukan pertama atau kedua kalinya hal ini terjadi, karena bahkan ada stiker peringatan yang terpasang. Istri saya terjebak di kamar mandi dan harus diselamatkan setelah 20 menit. Saya menelepon resepsionis, dan seseorang datang dan menanganinya, tetapi itu bukan pengalaman yang baik. Saya pikir akan lebih baik untuk menggantinya. 2. Meskipun lokalisasinya bagus, saya tidak familiar dengan merek lokal, tidak hanya untuk perlengkapan kamar mandi, tetapi bahkan untuk kopi. Semua orang sepertinya menggunakan mesin seperti Nespresso, jadi kopi tetes sepertinya bukan pilihan yang baik. 3. Di tengah malam, seseorang yang tidak dikenal memasuki kamar kami dengan suara keras lalu pergi. Saya pikir saya berhalusinasi saat setengah tertidur, tetapi istri saya bilang dia juga mendengarnya. Aku periksa CCTV, tapi terlalu merepotkan, jadi aku pergi saja."

Apakah hotel bintang 5 ini tidak mengajarkan sikap apa pun kepada setiap karyawannya??

"618.","deMon Gaming","3","2025-01-21","2","*DISCLAIMER, orang INDO tolong pakai google translate ya guys* terima kasih Saya menginap di sini saat acara tahun baru 31-01 bersama istri, anak saya, dan pengasuhnya.. 2 kamar dengan harga dua kali lipat dari harga normal, sarapan kami tidak terlalu mewah, rasanya makanannya hampir mendekati standar, ruang sarapannya terlihat tidak terawat (mereka menata ballroom biasa dengan isinya benar-benar kosong). Untungnya, band yang menciptakan suasana di kamar benar-benar mewujudkannya, kamarnya bersinar karena mereka. Kamar kami agak bau, ada bau amonia (dari kencing) di sana-sini. (sebelum komplain, anak saya tidak pipis di karpet atau di mana pun) Saya sudah lapor ke resepsionis, tapi tidak ada tindakan apa pun.. maaf saja.. Juga, setelah kami check out, kami baru tahu kalau istri saya meninggalkan cincinnya di kamar. Singkat cerita, dia sudah menghubungi pihak hotel dan pihak hotel tidak memberi tahu kami sama sekali (dia meninggalkan nomor teleponnya ke pihak hotel). Jadi kami bergegas kembali ke hotel. Saya kesal dan menelepon mereka, lalu mereka memberi tahu saya kalau cincinnya sudah ditemukan. Setibanya di hotel, kami menunggu sekitar 15 menit atau lebih sampai staf hotel mengembalikan cincin istri saya. Lalu, ternyata pihak hotel meminta kartu identitas adik perempuan saya, karena hotel itu dipesan atas namanya XD. Jadi, saya bilang ke mereka kalau yang Anda cari itu adik perempuan saya. Lalu saya mencari kartu identitas keluarga dan menunjukkannya kepada kepala keamanan Bapak Husein, lalu melanjutkan prosedur pengembalian cincin. 1. Halo, informasi tentang cincin dan detailnya diinformasikan langsung dari istri saya melalui telepon. 2. Posisi dan lokasinya terlalu diinformasikan oleh istri saya melalui telepon. 3. Setelah semua itu, Anda masih ingin menanyakan prosedurnya, tidak masalah, tetapi tidak ada satu orang pun yang datang untuk bertanggung jawab dan hadir di acara ini. Saya sudah berbicara dengan 2 staf berbeda melalui telepon. Setelah 15 menit di lobi, istri saya terpaksa menelepon staf tersebut lebih awal, karena mereka membutuhkan kartu identitas saudara perempuan saya untuk melanjutkan dan mengembalikan teleponnya. Selain itu, di lobi kami berbicara dengan staf lain untuk mengonfirmasi tentang acara ini, sampai akhirnya mereka memanggil kepala keamanan mereka (sepertinya mereka tidak memperkenalkan diri juga) dan kemudian saya menunjukkan kartu identitas keluarga saya kepadanya, dan akhirnya kami bisa pergi dari hotel Grand yang konyol ini. 5 juta/malam untuk ini? Benar-benar tidak sepadan."

Kami pesan sarapan pagi untuk dibawa pulang, tapi pas datang, bungkusnya pecah dan tiba-tiba makanan dan kopinya tumpah ke lantai lobi. Kami harus menunggu 30 menit lagi untuk disiapkan 🤷🏼‍♀️ 5. Kelebihannya, koridor dan kamarnya masih bersih dan tidak terlihat tua. Hotelnya di dalam mal, jadi gampang jalan-jalan. Maaf ya, kami tidak akan pernah kembali lagi."
"621.","cindy saputra","17","2023-01-21","2","Proses check-innya kurang memuaskan. Saya menginap di sini karena ada pernikahan. Saya memang datang lebih awal dari waktu check-in, tapi resepsionisnya bilang harus menunggu 30 menit sampai 1 jam lagi. Saya akan kembali satu jam kemudian, tapi mereka bilang harus menunggu lagi 20 menit lagi. Padahal saya lihat tamu lain bisa check-in lebih awal di waktu yang sama dengan kedatangan saya. Ketika saya tanya, resepsionisnya bilang karena saya pesan kamar yang lebih besar. Sepertinya di sini mereka memperlakukan kamar standar lebih baik daripada kamar yang lebih besar. Mungkin saran buat kalian yang mau menginap di sini nanti, pesan saja kamar standar deluxe, daripada kamar yang lebih besar 🙂🥲"
"622.","Kemal Fellini","14","2022-01-21","2","Kecewa dengan pengalaman check-in. Waktu check-in pukul 15.00, kami memberi tahu pihak hotel bahwa kami akan check-in pukul 16.00. Ketika kami tiba pukul 16.00, kami diberi tahu bahwa kamar kami masih akan dibersihkan karena penghuni sebelumnya - seorang anggota Platinum - baru saja check-out terlambat. Tidak ada kamar lagi yang tersedia. Kami menunggu hingga akhirnya bisa check-in pukul 18.00. Tidak ada layanan gratis apa pun. Kami berpikir untuk meminta check-out terlambat sebagai kompensasi atas keterlambatan check-in kami, tetapi kami tidak melakukannya karena kami sudah kesal dan lebih baik tidak memperpanjang masa inap kami lagi. Benar-benar mengecewakan seluruh pengalaman menginap di hotel ini dan saya rasa mengulas hotel lainnya tidak akan objektif."

"661.","mion HR","190","2022-01-21","3","First time, parkirnya ribet karena harus menyesuaikan mall which is sekitar jam10 baru dibuka. Sedangkan acara kantor mulai jm10 otomatis harus sudah dipersiapkan sebelum waktunya sedangkan parkirnya aja ribet, belibet. Kalau mau ke lantai 3 langsung harusnya parkir di B2, dan parkir itu yg langsung masuk hotel. Sedangkan parkiran B1 yang sudah ready hanya masuk mall, dan kalau pagi kudu ke hotel ini ya otomatis menjadi pengunjung pertama mall ini. Dan berkali2 kudu check-in di app pedulilindungi baik itu mau breakfast atau sekedar ambil barang ke parkiran. Cukup melelahkan. Untuk breakfastnya juga menurut saya kurang variatif, jadi kebanyakan sama dan kurang enak. Dan yang cukup buat saya kecewa sekelas hotel bintang 5 dengan tatanan serba marmer, menu makan malamnya selama 3 malam menginap, nasinya keras sekali seperti nasi aking sungguh tidak dapat dinikmati. Kelebihannya, kamarnya cukup luas dengan tema classic dan dilengkapi dengan bathtub. Untuk shower dan wc terpisah. Dan room service untuk pembersihan kamarnya cekatan, bersih, dan solutif. Goodjob 👍 semoga kedepannya Sheraton bisa memberi solusi termudah bagi tamu yang menginap dan lebih bervariasi lg dalam hal makanan."
"662.","Arifien M.","1746","2021-01-21","3","Lokasi cukup baik. Pelayanan baik. Kamar cukup nyaman. Dengan amenities cukup lengkap. Pelayanan housekeeping bisa lebih baik lagi, agar tidak miss-com lagi. Tanda kiblat di kamar sampe skrg belum nemu dimana posisinya, untung ada aplikasi di HP jadi terbantu. Mengenai sarapan pagi di resto seharusnya ada optional buat dibawa ke kamar, apalagi jumlah seat terbatas karena phisical distancing, karena jika badan kita kurang fit agak riskan juga jika harus berkerumun di resto. Yang bikin kurang nyaman adalah di hari berikutnya dimana saat breakfast dibagi 3 batch, tapi aturan hotel tidak ketat. Dimana saat saya di batch 3/ terakhir saat masuk masih banyak pengunjung batch ke 2 sebelumnya. Jadinya SAMA AJA RAMAI DAN TIDAK EFEKTIF. Kemungkinan saya akan pikir2 lagi akan menginap di hotel ini jika aturannya begini."
"663.","Mr. R","252","2022-01-21","3","Kurang worth it kalau untuk hotel bintang 5 dengan harga di atas 2 juta per malam. Toiletteriesnya below expectation (kaya hotel kelas bintang 3), belum pakai smart TV, dan staffnya kurang attentive & responsive. Satu-satunya nilai plus adalah karena nempel dengan Gandaria City Mall."
"664.","Intan Qonita","55","2024-01-21","3","Saya kesini akhir Februari lalu untuk sebuah acara instansi pemerintah. Kamar mandi di lantai grandballroomnya kurang terurus. Ada yang tidak bisa digunakan, berantakan dan tidak ada tisu toilet. Agak kaget ngeliatnya karena tidak mencerminkan statusnya sebagai hotel bintang 5."
"665.","Sigit Pramono","204","2022-01-21","3","Kalau untuk keamanan nya sangat ketat dan banyak petugasnya yang menyebar dimana-mana. Hanya sayang bila ojol sedang mengantarkan pesanan buat tamu hotel, sangat kesulitan untuk mencari parkirannya, terutama bagi yang baru datang kesana. Tolong diperhatikan buat pengelola hotel nya agar menyediakan tempat parkiran khusus buat ojol apalagi bila malam hari dan menjelang pagi."

"669.","My Bee","270","2022-01-21","3","Bismillah Ku berkunjung kesini karena ada Study Expo di Hotel Sheraton Sebelum masuk mall Gandaria, kita mesti check in via Peduli Lindungi Baru dech masuk mall Lokasi lobi ada di lantai dasar, depan patung (ku gak fhoto patungnya, karna patungnya aneh) Sebelum masuk lobi, kita mesti check in lagi truz tasnya di periksa ma petugas (dimasukin ke dalam mesin / kayak di bandara² gitu) Petugasnya ramah & sgt membantu sekali Ku pergi ke lantai Ground tuk expo Sangat bersih Sejuk & nyaman Tapiiiiiiiii.... Tuk mushola nya di lantai 3, sangatlah kecil Tempat wudhu tuk ikhwan & akhwat terpisah Ada tempat tuk naruh sepatu Tempat wudhu tersedia 2 keran air Tuk tempat sholat, sgt kecil bgt 😑😑( mungkin muat tuk 6 jamaah laki² & 5 jamaah perempuan) ➡️Lebih luas toiletnya Ikhwan & akhwan berada di ruangan yg sama, hanya dipisahkan dengan tirai Semoga next time Pihak manajemen mampu membuat mesjid di dalam hotel yang nyaman dan lebih besar Coz ini akan sangat membantu para tamu yang sedang datang berkunjung Jazaakumullah khair"

"728.","Sang Yoon Lim","108","2025-07-21","3","Kondisi kamar dan fasilitasnya bersih dan baik. Lokasinya strategis karena berada di pusat kota. Sarapannya tidak terlalu enak, tetapi bisa dimakan. Namun, kekurangannya adalah jendelanya tidak kedap suara, sehingga sulit tidur nyenyak karena suara salat subuh."
"729.","marcillia wahyudi","14","2025-06-21","3","Semuanya selalu menyenangkan kecuali hari ini. Resepsionisnya Fadul, dia tidak mendengarkan dengan baik. Gagal memberikan harga yang benar. Saya bilang saya sudah punya member Bonvoy sejak awal dan dia sudah menanyakan email member. Namun, harganya ternyata salah. Dan dia tidak minta maaf. Dan saya tanya kenapa beda, dan dia bilang karena saya tidak diberi disc member. Astaga, pria ini selalu mengangkat kepalanya tinggi-tinggi dan berbicara seperti robot. Staf Sheraton lainnya selalu tulus seperti sebelumnya..tetapi pria ini benar-benar bertindak seperti pria yang berhak. Bukan pengalaman yang sangat baik untuk kembali ke sini lagi. Mereka juga tidak bertanya apakah bayi saya butuh boks bayi atau apa pun. Jadi ya, membayar lebih mahal untuk sambutan yang tidak begitu baik"
"730.","Dr. Aquarius","702","2025-08-21","3","Ruang konferensi bagus, tetapi makanan untuk makan siang tidak begitu banyak!"
"731.","imam uddin H","31","2024-01-21","3","Hotel yang bagus tetapi perlu meningkatkan layanan FB mereka. Saya tidak yakin, mereka kekurangan staf atau tidak siap. Saat kami mengadakan pertemuan, kami tidak bisa mendapatkan gelas bersih untuk diminum. Mereka tidak mengisi ulang minuman. Tapi mereka tetap memberi kami air mineral dalam botol."
"732.","Ahmed Ramdani Salim","726","2022-01-21","3","Lingkungan yang nyaman, layanan prima, dan makanan perlu distandarisasi dengan ketat jika katering dari luar diperbolehkan. Reputasi hotel terancam. Mushola di lantai 3 perlu ditingkatkan, desain dan kondisinya sangat berbeda dengan standar hotel."
"733.","Aris","317","2020-01-21","3","Senang sekali menginap di sini. Dekat juga dengan rumah saya. Stafnya harus selalu tersenyum. Saya suka sarapannya, hanya saja tempatnya terlalu kecil dan mereka punya pintu penghubung di lantai dasar ke mal. Hanya saja, terkadang di dalam lift baunya sangat tidak enak."
"734.","Geryndia A.","119","2025-01-21","3","Pengalaman yang bagus, kolam renangnya bagus. Namun, ada kabel yang putus di dalam kolam dan terlalu berbahaya untuk berenang di sana."
"735.","Andre Mirza","368","2022-01-21","3","Kedua kalinya menginap di sini, proses check in sangat lambat karena proses pembersihan, tiba pukul 12.30 dan harus menunggu hampir 2 jam untuk dapat masuk kamar, sangat mengecewakan dengan peraturannya, hal baiknya hotel ini terletak di atas mal besar sehingga mudah untuk mendapatkan makanan dan berbelanja"
"736.","Archimedes Daely","48","2023-01-21","3","Saya ingin mengeluhkan prosedur yang dilakukan staf Sheraton, terutama Pak Jajuli di bagian resepsionis. Saya membantu rekan saya dari Thermo Fisher Singapura yang rutin menginap di Sheraton. Salah satu dari mereka membutuhkan saya untuk mengirimkan kotak pemasaran. Saya memilih GoSend untuk mengantarkannya ke lobi hotel, di bagian atas kotak tertulis nama penerima. Saya meminta pengemudi untuk mengirimkannya ke lobi hotel dan membiarkan staf hotel yang menerimanya. Saya berharap prosesnya akan berjalan lancar, tetapi saya salah. Pak Jajuli bersikeras bahwa tanpa nomor kamar, dia tidak dapat menerima barang. Maksud saya, dia dapat memeriksa dengan nama dan nomor ponsel serta nama perusahaan yang tertulis di dalam kotak. Saya mengerti bahwa dia tidak dapat menerima tanpa identitas yang jelas, tetapi upaya untuk membantu sangat minim. Hal ini sangat mengejutkan, mengingat Sheraton adalah salah satu hotel terkemuka. Mungkin harapannya salah, stafnya tidak terlatih dengan baik. Semoga masukan ini dapat sampai ke manajemen dan meningkatkan layanan di masa mendatang."
"737.","Christoph Rumo","22","2017-01-21","3","Hotel ini menawarkan pusat kebugaran terbaik dan kolam renang yang bagus. Satu-satunya hal yang dapat dilakukan di dekatnya adalah mengunjungi pusat perbelanjaan, yang dapat diakses langsung dari hotel tanpa harus keluar."
"738.","Tjian Wie","293","2017-01-21","3","Makanannya kurang enak dibandingkan Mariotts, Hotel Mulia, atau Satoo di Hotel Shangri-La. Lobi hotel tidak banyak tempat untuk berfoto seperti di Shangri-La."
