"1.","Ravi Chahal","79","2025-12-01","5","I recently stayed at JW Marriott Hotel Surabaya and had an amazing experience! The hotel is simply great, with a fantastic location that makes travelling around the city very convenient. Service is nothing short of phenomenal and the staff are extremely polite and professional. A special mention goes to Mr. Rohmad at the front desk—he was incredibly helpful during my check-in and ensured all my requirements were taken care of perfectly. I have given 4 stars to the rooms, only because the ageing is showing in some areas. The rooms and bathroom hardware feel a bit old, though everything is fully functional and well-maintained. Overall, this is an amazing hotel to stay at and I highly recommend it for anyone visiting Surabaya. I will definitely return!"

"3.","Awim Krisdianto","112","2025-12-18","5","Sudah 2 kali menginap dengan nyaman di JW Marriott Surabaya. Staf ramah, baik dari satpam maupun resepsionis, hanya saja parkirannya tidak ada peneduhnya. Meskipun hotel sudah 10 tahun lebih, namun Kamar bersih, rapi, dan pelayanan housekeeping baik serta ramah. Terima kasih kepada tim housekeeping, khususnya mas Diky dan mas Welly, atas perhatian selama menginap."
"4.","Evelyn Wongsosaputro","3","2025-11-01","4","It is an older hotel with a bit of old hotel smell, specially the hallways. But they made it up with all the other plus points: Great location right smack in the middle of Tunjungan area. Walking distance to Tunjungan Plaza and Ayam Goreng President (important). Service is warm and attentive. Breakfast spread is amazing. Lots of choice and local favorites such as tahu tek, nasi goreng duk duk and lupis. Bonus point: they actually have a hidden bar with great cocktails (try the Strawberry Negroni) and live music on the basement called Anonimo. Ask one of the staff to show you."

"7.","Happy Family","7","2025-12-11","2","Menginap disini tgl 6 & 7 Desember 2025. Utk hotel bintang 5, avur/ buangan air di wastafel sangat lambat shg wastafel kotor & di shower box, air tdk mengalir ke floor drain, shg menggenang semata kaki jika dipakai mandi🙄 Area parkir sangat sulit, sekuriti tdk membantu utk mengarahkan/ mencarikan tempat parkir, hanya menyarankan utk valet parkir yg berbayar 100rb😄 Layanan sarapan dikamar, mengecewakan, hanya diberi roti dimasukan dalan kantong kertas😄"
"8.","rdio primasatya","16","2025-12-01","3","Beberapa kali makan di restonya dan menu nya cukup variatif dan enak enak, cuma setiap mau menginap dengan corporate selalu diarahkan ke pak sofyan dan tidak ada respon. Cukup kecewa dan akhirnya belum pernah jadi menginap disitu"
"9.","hangga noe89","10","2025-12-01","3","Reseption nya nyolot waktu kita mau cek in, mungkin karena kita sampai hotel sekitar jam 10 yg artinya belum bisa cek in, lebih baik di informasikan bila tidak bisa early cek in, dr pada bicara ke customer kalo kamar sedang di bersihkan, karena keluarga kami sudah di hotel 1 hari sebelumnya, atau di informasikan saja bila ada penambahan biaya, saya rasa jg tidak masalah krn kami jauh datang dr luar kota,"
"10.","Pradita Arisgi","46","2025-12-01","5","Fasilitas lengkap, semua desain detail. Petugasnya ramah, makanan resto lumayan yg penting menunya lengkap banget dari mulai makanan Jawa, Oriental, Asia, dsb ada. Ada kegiatan untuk anak2"

"14.","Wei-Han Tan","148","2025-09-01","5","Incredible hotel and amazing staff. Probably the most friendly team we’ve encountered in our travels and the pool was wonderful. We loved the breakfast buffet, make sure you get there earlier than us as we only had 20 minutes to close but the staff were super and went out of their way to bring us food. Thank you again for everything and an incredibly memorable stay."
"15.","Gunawan Prajogo","183","2025-10-01","5","My wife and I attended an engangement party there. The food choices, the services and the entertainments were super. I would say the portions are just correct, not too little and not too many. They were just perfect for city people like us, the tastes were also excellent."

"23.","aulia fikriati","35","2025-07-01","5","Staycation for 1 night. As a 5-stars hotel, the service was definitely top notch. The staff was really helpful and friendly. No deposit required during check in. Welcome drink was served in the lobby. The room was tidy and clean. I ordered deluxe room with king bed, city view. The view was perfect facing the crowd of Surabaya. The only thing that needs improvement is the toilet, the floor of the right side of the toilet is a little bit higher than the drain hole. So the water was not flowing. Facility for kids: 1. Pool with cute pool floats (the pool is 0.6m - 1m - 1.1m - 1.3 m in one area) 2. Playground near the pool (indoor and outdoor) 3. Kids club area Breakfast: Well they have everything 😄 I always love their croissant."

"29.","G Stiefel","12","2025-11-01","5","The SPA Treatments are Goldstar. The traditional Massage only topped by the highly qualified Facial Treatment Antioxidant by Mrs. Lilik. Reception staff very attentative with a quick orientation through the Gymnasium, Sauna etc."
"30.","Judd","264","2025-09-01","4","The property feels a bit dated but is still well maintained. If you plan to book, I recommend the Junior Suite. The lobby, however, had an overly strong JW Signature Scent; it would be better if the fragrance was used more subtly."
"31.","Jaka Utama","211","2025-10-01","5","The cleanliness, complete amenities and facility was a luxury hotel standard. But i really love how the staff from concierge, receptionists, bell boy, security, their smile feels so sincere, from heart. and more over, i was amazed of how ( i forgot her name - the woman who stood before the restaurant) remember me and my friends name. If anyone asks me of what i think about JW Marriott Surabaya: It's exceptionally heartfully friendly!"
"32.","Rahma M","238","2025-08-01","5","Pengalaman menginap yang benar-benar premium.

"33.","Rifka Fachrunnisa","4","2025-09-01","5","It was an amazing stay at the Junior Suite - a perfect place to meet deadlines. Everything was immaculate. The food was incredible, thanks to the talented chef! A surprising and flavorful rawon for breakfast; Chef Endra is definitely a highlight. It's truly worth every penny."
"34.","Sahril Ika","12","2025-12-04","5","Hotel lama bintang 5 yang masih bertahan smpe skrg ... cmn parkir sepedanya agak jauh dri lobby hotel.Hujan kehujanan juga"
"35.","Lydia","95","2025-08-01","5","Most affordable JW Marriott I ever stayed. Property is quite old but they’ve maintained well to the standard of Marriott. Room was very spacious, luxurious and clean, well kept for the age of the hotel. Breakfast spread was excellent too. The famous French toast was recommended by the staff and it was delicious too. They have free shuttle buss to Tanjungan plaza but for me it was easy walking distance to Tanjungan Plaza and Tanjungan street."
"36.","CY","187","2025-09-01","5","My stay at the JW Marriott Surabaya was excellent. The room was both spacious and very clean. I was particularly impressed with the delicious and varied breakfast selection at the Pavillion restaurant. A special thank you to Fia, who was incredibly attentive and provided outstanding service. I truly enjoyed my time here."
"37.","Dewi Everaers","207","2025-08-01","5","Nginep di Marriot manapun ga pernah gagal. Staff sangat ramah dan membantu. Menginap disini pas long weekend jadi area pool menjadi sangat seru buat anak2. Ada stand makanan, bouncy, movie with beanbags dll Gym, kidsclub, spa dan jacuzzi berada dalam 1 area. Breakfast sangat lengkap, bikin semangat. Bahkan ada special of the day ☺️. Semua sangat nyaman dan menyenangkan."
"38.","Naufal Achmad","4","2025-08-01","5","Lokasi strategis berdekatan dg fasilitas publik. Pelayanan OK. Utk karyawan Mas Yudhi, terima kasih sudah semangat dan baik hati memastikan kenyamanan kami dg fasilitas yang disediakan oleh hotel. Sukses selalu."
"39.","Lily Chu","17","2025-07-01","4","One can tell that the building and room is kind of old but overall clean. Hotel staff were very friendly, bed was comfy, room view was pretty good, overall good considering the price for a four/five-star hotel. However, they do security scans every time you enter the hotel, which I personally find it kind of inconvenient. (Possibly because of the past Surabaya terrorist attacks.) And the scent of the toiletries (mandarin tea) they provide smells bad, but this might just be my own preference."
"40.","Mimi mimo","5","2025-09-01","5","Menginap di sini seperti mendapat pengalaman baru, semua diperhatikan dengan baik. kamar sangat bersih, makanan sangat enak, semua petugas sangat ramah,dan saya ucapkan terima kasih kepada housekeeping diky yang selalu membersihkan kamar selama saya menginap . Saya pulang dengan perasaan puas."

"43.","Ahmed Shafique","2","2025-10-01","5","Given Indonesia’s culture of hospitality and excellent service, this hotel has held the Indonesian flag high. My stay here at JW Marriott Surabaya for two splendid nights was simply remarkable. From the personalised service to the quality of staff who take pride in their work, these went beyond my expectations. This hotel has been around for a long time and I have to say, it is old but gold. You don’t see many hotels with classic and heritage detailed interior design left, that I dare say is more beautiful than the modern ones. Not forgetting the striking polished marble flooring at every edge of this hotel. My compliments to Manager Agung who checked in on us and made sure we had a pleasant stay. I trust the team at JW Marriott will continue to keep these standards high, for us to keep coming back."
"44.","Agung Nugroho","21","2025-10-01","5","The location hotel is near shopping mall Tunjung Plaza ,the room clean,tidy and smell good. don't forget the facillities such as the pool ,the gym,kids club and executive lounge. It is so delightful and satisfying stay here."
"45.","uthed chandra","103","2025-08-01","5","Jika dibandingkan dengan Marriott di kota lain, rasanya Marriott yang di Sby terasa lebih mewah dan lebih ketat untuk akses keluar masuknya. Untuk fasilitas, gak perlu diragukan lagi ya. Pelayanan juga super ramah. Full senyum, helpfull dan selalu nyaman menginap disini."
"46.","zaki ibrahim","88","2025-09-01","5","My recent stay at JW Marriott Surabaya as rewards for our 37 years of wedding anniversary was a masterclass in hospitality. The exceptional service began the moment we arrived, with the doormen offering a genuine and warm welcome. The reception team continued this stellar service, and we were particularly delighted by the lady manager who took the time to greet us and have a wonderful chat, making us feel truly valued. The dining experience during breakfast was another highlight, perfectly reflecting the JW Marriott's reputation for excellence. We were treated to an incredible breakfast, where the talented Chef Mami surprised us with a special dish of the day that was simply unforgettable. The passion of the restaurant team was evident in every interaction.While the service and dining were flawless, there were a few elements of the room that didn't meet the expected 5-star standard. The JW Marriott name should be upheld in every aspect, and we felt that some of the in-room amenities, while clean, were well past their prime. We understand the hotel has a long and proud history as a nearly 30-year-old establishment, but minor things like the mattresses, pillows, and towels shouldn't age with the building. The mattress felt worn out and the pillows lacked support, while the towels, though fresh, no longer had that soft, plush feel. Feeling of Premium Guest Room fade away... Overall, this was an outstanding stay defined by the incredible people who work there. A small refresh of the room amenities is all that's needed to make this hotel a truly flawless and iconic destination. We can't wait to visit again."
"47.","Dee","733","2025-12-11","5","Saya menginap di hotel ini 3 malam, dari tgl 26 - 29 Mei 2025 dan kunjungan kedua saya tgl 26 - 29 November 2025. Lokasinya strategis, dg 25 lantai dan kamar sebanyak 407 dg tipe dari Guest Room hingga Presidential Suite. Banyak fasilitas yang disediakan hotel diantaranya 6 rumah makan (Imari Japanese Restaurant, Lobby Lounge, Pavilion Restaurant, Surabaya Baking Company, Tang Palace Chinese Restaurant, Uppercut Steakhouse, pusat kebugaran, kolam renang, spa, dan 14 ruang pertemuan. Staffnya ramah - ramah dan hafal nama guests hotel, terutama Chefnya pak Hendra, mengajak saya ngobrol dan berbagai menu breakfast yg dibuatnya. Begitu juga dg mbk Linda waitress di ruang breakfast dan mbk Rani di resepsionist yg membantu saya ketika check in maupun check out. Security, bell boy dan staff lainnya pun ramah dan selalu menyapa dg bahasa yg santun dan informatif. Saya sangat terkesan dg keramaian para staff di hotel ini. Sayangnya dikunjungi kedua saya, saya minta jamu mix, hingga saya selesai breakfast jamunya tak kunjung tiba. Breakfastnya pun cukup lengkap, ada menu Nusantara, Western, China dan Jepang. Rasanya enak, roti muffinnya, dessert nya, buburnya, dll. Kamarnya bersih, luas dan lengkap hanya sayang saya ga menemukan hair dyer di kamar. Amenities nya pun lengkap. Di sebrang hotel ini ada beberapa resto yg enak rasanya. Ada soto Kambing/Sapi dan Sate dg harga yg murah, ada juga resto yg menjual Bebek/Ayam/Burung/Lele bakar & goreng dg sambalnya yg enak serta Rawon khas Surabaya. Hotel ini bisa menjadi pilihan jika traveling ke Surabaya. Recommend.."

"49.","bastiana puspitaningtyas","3","2025-10-01","5","Greetings from Singapore It's not my first time staying in the JW Marriott Surabaya. My mother loves this hotel so much. This hotel is like a home for me. The FO department is always welcoming us with warm smiles and fast responses. Our room is always clean and tidy. Never underestimate the bed in Marriott. Always the best! Thanks to the HK team. The amazing part is the breakfast. They have an amazing breakfast menu. And change every single day. Local or international menu they have it. My mother's fav is Beef tending. And my favorite is “jajanan pasar” which always changes every day so I can enjoy different jajanan pasar every day during my stay. The FBS and FBP teams are very warm and always double-check with us if we need anything else. Thanks to Lidya, Via, Guntur, and Romi for always looking after us during breakfast. And Big thanks to Chef Endra for the amazing beef rendang and the menu. See you again!!"
"50.","Natalie Kaunang","27","2025-08-01","5","I've been to different hotels during this Java trip and JW Marriott Surabaya's hospitality is on another level. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. Special thanks to one of the staff, Fia, who's constantly making sure all guests feel welcomed. My husband and I told her we would love to try some of the local cuisine and she informed us that one of the hotel's signature dishes was Rawon. The next day's breakfast, we were served Rawon specially made for us. It was one of the best Rawons I've ever had. The hotel's location is also strategic. The kids loved the pool. Would love to come back next time."
"51.","Deddy Cahyono","31","2025-09-01","1","Sorry if this review comes a little late, but I believe it is better late than never, especially when it serves as important feedback for evaluation. I stayed as a guest on June 16–17, 2025. I would like to express that JW Marriott has always been the preferred and favorite choice for me and my family. However, our most recent experience was both disappointing and extremely concerning. My child nearly drowned in the swimming pool due to the absence of a lifeguard on duty. At that critical moment, my wife attempted to help but was unable to do so because of the pool’s depth, while I was briefly in our room retrieving clothes. The situation was nearly fatal. It is truly regrettable that a hotel of JW Marriott’s caliber, carrying such an esteemed international reputation, does not provide continuous safety supervision at its swimming pool facilities. This is not a minor oversight, but rather a serious safety hazard that endangers guests’ lives. We consider this a fundamental breach of the standards of service and safety that should be a top priority for a hotel of this standing. Safety is non-negotiable, especially at a world-class hotel like JW Marriott. We sincerely hope that management will recognize the seriousness of this issue and take immediate corrective measures, as a single act of negligence could cost a guest’s life"

"53.","M Nur Sholikin","1","2025-07-01","5","Pengalaman menginap di JW Marriot sangat mengesankan. Fasilitas dan pelayanan tidak perlu diceritakan. Sudah pasti berkualitas. Yang paling membuat nyaman adalah keramahan semua tim. Dan luar biasa, terima kasih kepada Chef Endra Yudah Setiawan, yang menyapa saya dan istri saat sarapan dengan obrolan kecil tentang makanan dan saat itu istri saya menyampaikan tentang rawon. Tak lama setelah obrolan, tiba-tiba dibuatkan rawon khusus untuk istri dan saya. Ini pengalaman yang belum pernah saya dapatkan di hotel-hotel lain yang saya singgahi. Terima kasih sekali lagi Chef Endra dan tim JW Marriot Surabaya."

"55.","Dessy Dwi Prasetyowati","12","2025-06-01","5","Hotel bersih memuaskan.. Spv housekeeping bp Jefry saat saya dan suami di kamar 702 sangat baik dan helpfull selama saya menginap. Karena kami menginap cukup lama (2-3minggu untuk pengobatan suami di RS Adi Husada), ada saatnya kami ingin pindah kamar untuk mendapatkan view yang berbeda, dan dibantu oleh bp Jefry ke kamar 1708. Di resto saat breakfast juga ada Bu Vera yang sangat cekatan membantu tamu menemukan meja dan memastikan kebutuhan tamu yang dapat ia bantu. 2 hari ini bu vera cuti, jadi bahkan hari ini kaki harus mencari sendiri kursi kosong karena tidak ada yang mengarahkan… Terima kasih Bp Jefry dan Bu Vera atas segala bantuannya selama kami menginap di JW Marriott Surabaya.."
"56.","zhen feeh","23","2025-07-01","5","A Wonderful Stay at JW Marriott Surabaya This was my second visit to Surabaya, and I decided to stay at JW Marriott Surabaya. From the moment I arrived, I was impressed by the warm and friendly service from all the staff – from the doorman to the front desk team. The welcome drink was a thoughtful touch, especially refreshing in the hot weather. Our room was spotless, cozy, and very comfortable. I was also pleasantly surprised by the lovely birthday decorations – thank you for making the occasion extra special! The breakfast buffet offered a wide variety of delicious options. A special shoutout to Chef Endra for the amazing Rawon – it was rich, authentic, and absolutely delicious. During our stay, we also spent time at the Lobby Lounge and really enjoyed the live music and cocktails – a perfect combination to wind down in the evening. We even visited SBCO twice because their fresh bakery items and cakes were just too good to resist! Overall, we had a fantastic 3-day, 2-night stay. A heartfelt thank you to all the staff we encountered – your professionalism and hospitality made our trip truly memorable. We look forward to coming back again!"

"66.","Esti Rahayu","22","2025-09-01","1","The security screening staff at this hotel is blatantly discriminatory. On August 7, I returned from dinner and watched as a group arriving in a luxury vehicle walked right past the X-ray scanner without a single item being checked. Yet, when I approached the same screening area, a staff member immediately demanded that I have my bag screened. When I confronted him about the group that had just been let through, his response was, 'They just went out for a bit.' I, too, had only 'just gone out for a bit.' This is a clear case of selective and unfair treatment, and there is no excuse for such hypocrisy."

"74.","Jeanne","165","2025-06-01","4","One of the best hotels to stay in Surabaya, unfortunately I received an unpleasant treatment from one of the security guards on duty in the parking lot. I came on a rainy day, the first time I parked, I wrongfully parked a bit far from the lobby and I was trapped in front of the ballroom door which was locked. I saw the security using an umbrella, I asked whether I could borrow the umbrella to go to the lobby but the security instead told me to go through the edge of the stairs, which still made me a little wet. The second time I came, it was drizzling and I chose to park upstairs and asked the security in the same location (though I'm not sure if they're the same person) if I could park another place instead of there since I was worried tomorrow could rain after I check out (it was an open space), which the security responds with not being able to park near a slightly shady spot, not being able to park downstairs because it's for an apartment, and immediately saying just use valet. Which I found a bit unhelpful knowing that valet parking cost money. The other staff were very helpful and very kind especially the receptionist, the housekeeping, and the valet officers. The room was huge and clean, it had a nice ambience and smell. The location itself was perfect. I'm not sure if I'm coming back since the parking location is a bit far and an open spot so it wasn't comfortable during rainy days."

Kamar yang spacious, bersih, nice and full amenities, nyaman dengan ceiling yang tinggi serta design interior yang menunjukan bahwa its 5 stars. Staff dari mulai pintu terdepan sampai mereka yang memandu di ruang makan, semua humble, full senyum dan helpful. Food and beverages yang gak perlu diragukan, breakfast yang lengkap dari menu tradisional surabaya hingga menu multinasional mereka sajikan dengan lengkap dan dengan citarasa yang memang awesome. Perlu menjadi hotel pilihan jika kembali singgah di Surabaya.."

Untuk kesekian kalinya saya menginap di hotel ini, baik untuk keperluan bisnis maupun liburan (bersama keluarga). Selalu menjadi pilihan pertama jika sedang di Surabaya tercinta. Hotel ini senantiasa memberikan kesan istimewa, sering terdapat kue maupun buah dalam kamar, termasuk ucapan dari rekan housekeeping. Staf yang sangat ramah, mulai rekan security, receptionist, hingga rekan di bagian resto. Salah satu yang menambah kesan istimewa adalah sebagian besar staf hotel hafal nama kita. Menu breakfast variatif, terlebih senantiasa terdapat ice cream setiap harinya, plus matcha. Lokasi yang strategis dekat dengan pusat perbelanjaan dan kuliner. Klo kata orang jawa ... josss gandosss"

"90.","Chan Chan","11","2025-06-01","5","We had an amazing 5-night leisure stay at JW Marriott Hotel Surabaya. From the moment we arrived, the staff made us feel genuinely welcome. The hospitality was warm and consistent across all areas—from the front desk to the breakfast lounge, gym, pool, and housekeeping. We stayed in a Junior Suite that was spacious, quiet, and very comfortable. The bed was great, the bathroom was large and clean, and all amenities were replenished daily. Housekeeping truly impressed us with their attention to detail, noticing how we set up the bathroom floor towel on the first night and continuing that arrangement the rest of the stay. Small things like that made a big difference. The gym, pool, and jacuzzi were spotless and well maintained. We had breakfast daily at the lounge and also dined twice at the Uppercut steakhouse. Although the steak wasn’t perfect on our first visit, the staff went above and beyond to arrange a special meal for us the next night. Their service recovery was excellent. Overall, the hotel had a calm and luxurious vibe that helped us truly relax. Check-in and check-out were quick and smooth. This was our first time staying at a JW Marriott and it left a lasting impression. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Surabaya. Thank you to the entire JW Marriott Surabaya team for an unforgettable stay!"
"91.","Michael Munro","273","2025-01-01","5","Have now stayed here many times. Very friendly and attentive staff.

Staff di semua bagian mulai dari security, lobby, resepsionis, resto, meeting room sangat ramah, helpful dan cepat tanggap. Terimakasih untuk Mas Wachid dan Mbak Cinta yang ramah menyapa customer di resto, serta Mas Deny di bagian japanesse food. Terimakasih juga untuk Mas Afrianto di bagian housekeeping yang care terhadap kondisi kamar."
"98.","Syem Barangan","53","2025-01-01","5","The JW Marriott in Surabaya is pretty solid, though the rooms feel a bit old-school. They’re still clean and comfortable, with a nice bathtub to relax in and a work desk if you need to get some things done. Plus, the view of the city skyline is a nice bonus. Breakfast is decent but nothing too special, a mix of western and local dishes. But the service here is fantastic—staff is super friendly and really attentive to your needs. The hotel’s location is perfect, right in the middle of the city, so it’s easy to get around. All in all, it’s a good place to stay if you’re looking for comfort, great service, and a prime location. I'll update this review when I stay at this hotel again"

"102.","Muhamad Jainuri","9","2025-04-01","4","SOP parkir motor harus diperbaiki lagi. Pada saat masuk ada security yg menghampiri untuk memberikan karcis parkir disertai dg note jumlah helm dll tetapi tidak ada pengecekan jok motor saat masuk. Padahal berangkat dr kantor saya memang sudah membawa helm 2 dan 1 nya pinjam teman saya dan ditaruh di jok motor. Pada saat keluar karcis saya berikan ke security kemudian disuruh buka jok motor, setelah dibuka kemudian security yang berjaga menyuruh saya lapor ke kantor satpam krn helm ada 2 tp di karcis ditulis satu, disitulah saya menjelaskan kronologinya. Akhirnya dipersilahkan untuk keluar. Sangat disayangkan dengan adanya kejadian tsb. Klu mmg mau menjalankan SOP keamanan yg baik seharusnya sebelum masuk dan ketika mau keluar sepeda motor diwajibkan membuka jok motor. Kritik & saran ini bukan untuk menjatuhkan pihak tertentu, tetapi untuk memperbaiki dan memberikan masukan kepada manajemen tentang SOP Keamanan. Sangat disayangkan dengan pelayanan hotel yg sudah bagus harus dinodai hal tsb. Terima kasih 🙏"

"108.","Bagus Raditya","216","2025-01-01","5","JW Marriott Surabaya adalah hotel mewah yang menawarkan pengalaman menginap yang luar biasa di jantung kota. Dengan desain yang elegan dan fasilitas modern, hotel ini menjadi pilihan utama bagi pelancong bisnis maupun wisatawan. Lobby yang luas dan megah memberikan kesan pertama yang mengesankan, dilengkapi dengan layanan resepsionis yang ramah dan profesional. Kamar-kamarnya dirancang dengan sangat nyaman, lengkap dengan perabotan yang modern, tempat tidur yang empuk, dan fasilitas premium. Banyak kamar yang menawarkan pemandangan kota yang menakjubkan, dan kebersihan kamar selalu terjaga dengan baik. Hotel ini juga memiliki berbagai pilihan restoran yang menyajikan beragam masakan, mulai dari masakan internasional hingga kuliner lokal. Salah satu restoran yang patut dicoba adalah Cafe Gourmand, yang menawarkan sarapan prasmanan yang lezat dan beragam. Fasilitas tambahan seperti kolam renang, spa, dan pusat kebugaran membuat pengalaman menginap semakin menyenangkan. Lokasi JW Marriott sangat strategis, dekat dengan pusat perbelanjaan, restoran, dan berbagai atraksi wisata di Surabaya, memudahkan tamu untuk menjelajahi kota. Satu-satunya kekurangan mungkin adalah harga yang relatif tinggi, namun kualitas pelayanan dan fasilitas yang ditawarkan sebanding dengan biaya yang dikeluarkan. Secara keseluruhan, JW Marriott Surabaya adalah pilihan yang sangat baik untuk menginap di Surabaya, menawarkan kenyamanan, kemewahan, dan pelayanan prima yang akan membuat setiap tamu merasa istimewa."

We were woken up at 4am in the morning due to the loud prayers from outside and couldn’t sleep anymore cause it continued all the way until we checked out at 8am. This experience was far from the level of peace and comfort we expected from a hotel of JW Marriott’s prestige. The hotel staff were not addressing the issues even we reported during check out or via email. All we get are useless canned messages."

After walking had meeting with the sales and walking around the hotel, my friend and I sat down at the lobby bar waiting time before we left for another meeting.

The parking lot is small and limited, and the parking ticket was like a cheap wholesale store. The service at front desk lobby makes me waited for so long (more like 30 mins without any progress). The room wasn't clean enough because my husband start sneezing caused by the dust, and the room was not soundproof, any sound from the road and the mosque around can be heard clearly and loudly. When i complained about that, the hotel didn't fix it immediately and didn't give us any compliments. I'm not recommend this hotel for whoever stays here for a long time like us."

The hotel's prime location in the heart of the city, near Tunjungan Plaza, made everything so convenient. The facilities are top-notch, and the culinary experiences are simply divine. What truly made our stay unforgettable was the friendly and exceptionally well-trained staff. Special shoutouts to Pak Wachid in the breakfast/restaurant area, Pak Sigit the Chef, and Pak Tulus the concierge for their outstanding service. Overall, it was a lovely stay, and hope we have an opportunity again to come back to Surabaya and stay at this hotel again."

As it is part of the Marriott group, I do expect great facilities and services, and I got them during my stay . The hotel is very comfortable and luxurious, it has great space for many of its facilities, including the room. The bed is very comfy in the room is clean and it has all the amenities that you can expect from a five star hotel. The pool is great, the staff are friendly. Breakfast is also abundant and can definitely cater many people’s appetite with the wide ranging options they offer. It’s very close to Tunjungan Plaza malls as well so that we can walk here."

"162.","Julian Fowler","21","2025-01-01","3","Extremely disappointing..! We came purely for the Christmas lunch buffet (booked as Clay) so only commenting on food. Really a very average experience. With a Western guest who specifically wanted a home Xmas like Turkey and vegetables. The turkey was tough, dry and tasteless, the vegetables cold and almost raw. Also beef Wellington was also very tough and grisly far from a 5 star experience. The seafood however was good, otherwise this would have been a 0ne star review. Never will come back for Christmas, as they didn't seem to take our concerns or complaint seriously offering 2 pieces of cake free to try and satisfy us... so so disappointing from a five star hotel."
"163.","Faza","5","2025-01-01","5","Hotel termewah dan terbaik dikelasnya. Kamarnya besar, bagus dan bersih sekali.

"166.","Indra Rahman","25","2025-01-01","4","Secara umum bagus, staf ramah semua. Check in /out cepat dan lancar. Layanan londri perlu perbaikan Sy Sdh jd member marriot dan Sdh beberapa kali menginap long stay, ada satu hal yg masih belum berubah terkait londri dengan pola yang hampir sama berulang. Ada yg tidak mengambil baju kotor dan ada yg tidak mengirim hasil londri ke kamar. Hal yg terakhir ini baju2 sy selama 3 hari belum dikirim pihak londri ke kamar. Saya merasakan sebagai tamu beberapa kali dihukum oleh londri dg alasan yang sama, yakni saya belum bayar londri dimuka. Ya disini londri harus bayar dimuka baru dilayani. Padahal sy sdh bayar lunas dimuka, sdh pegang kuitansi londri bahkan sdh sy sampaikan ke kantor sy. Alasannya pihak londri belum dpt info pembayaran dari resepsionis. Well, itu masalah internal marriot, silakan selesaikan dan tolong jangan hukum kami para tamu gara2 masalah komunikasi internal hotel yang tidak bagus. Jumlah seating resto Hal lainnya, jumlah seating resto utk sarapan yg tdk sesuai jumlah kamar, hanya sekitar 1/5 dari luasan lantai. Jadi tamu antri dan rebutan kursi saat sedang peak days, saat spt itu sy memilih untuk tidak sarapan daripada buang waktu dan emosi akhirnya malah merusak momen sarapan sy yg berharga utk bekal mood seharian. Masalahnya, jika ingin sarapan take away harus pesan malam sebelum nya. Parkir mobil tanpa atap Satu lagi terkait parkir mobil. Luas memang parkiran nya tapi d lapangan terbuka tanpa atap hingga mobil kena panas hujan. Jadi masalah saat hujan harus jalan ke lobi dan tidak siap payung."
"167.","I Hadiputra","72","2025-01-01","3","Pro -staff is very friendly. top notch -nice breakfast -centrally located at the heart of Surabaya. -room is quite spacious Cons: -room is outdated -the room is not well insulated. the sound of the mosques (yes, multiple) will wake you up at 3-4 in the morning. it was very loud. I stayed on the 7th floor, and it was still very loud. This is coming from a local who live with mosque around, I am used to the sound. The volume is simply too high (or the room isolation is simply too poor). -the air circulation did not work well. I stayed on the non-smoking floor, but somehow I can smell smoke from the bathroom exhaust. It is not that they did not clean it well, but the smell just came out suddenly. The staff did manage to help by providing a machine to fix it and spraying perfume, but the smell of smoke come back later. I guess the building is just simply outdated."

Security tidak ada yg mau datang, justru customer dioper2 antar security. Setelah sekian lama menunggu dan kepanasan, akhirnya ada mobil yg keluar dan baru kami bisa keluar juga dari parkiran. Tanggapan manajemen juga kurang, kami komplain justru ditawari mengumpulkan poin2 agar tetap menginap di hotel dengan service buruk yg tidak sepadan dengan harganya ini. Kebersihan juga kurang. Di kamar minuman bekas pengunjung sebelumnya masih belum dibersihkan dari lemari es."

The recommendation was not wrong. Since our arrival, we have been treated above our expectations. Our breakfasts, lunch and dinner experiences were always wonderful. They were attentive and anticipated our needs. The housekeeping was great as well. Our room has been kept clean throughout our 5 nights stay. The team did a wonderful job of making us feel comfortable in our room. The doormen, security guards and front desk were all welcoming and friendly. We will definitely come back again and we are sure that our next stay will be enjoyable as well. We hope to see the familiar faces again. Thank you for the wonderful stay."

Tamu sedang ramai, ada pernikahan juga dan sepertinya ada acara Chinnese New Year, tapi tiap petugas tidak sedikitpun mengurangi keramahan dan peka terhadap tamu yang baru datang. Pelayanannya benar-benar bintang 5. Kamar super nyaman, luas, dan wangi. Kolam renangnya nyaman, airnya tidak terlalu dingin dan viewnya mantap. Jaccuzzinya ok. Ruang fitness nya suka!! Ada kids... aduh apa ya namanya lupa. Intinya mini playground indoor. Bersih banget dan pilihan mainannya banyak. Anak-anak saya senang. Breakfastnya, dijamin enak-enak semua. Dari semua menu minuman di breakfast, paling suka jamunya. Beras kencur hangat enak bangetttt!! Lokasi super strategis. Ga sampai 10 menit bisa jalan kaki ke Jl. Tunjungan dan Plaza Tunjungan.

"192.","Putri Rasyid","5","2025-01-01","5","We stayed in junior suite room, the hotel entrance looks super old fashioned, i think they need to renovate seriously. What makes me amazed the fact that their staffs are mostly seniors not really like a five star hotel in common. For that, i salute because they respect and keep their workers from a long time. The staffs are really friendly and responsive. One time i asked the staff to clean my room again since i have asthma and sensitive to their room mat, he came many times to make sure that everything is fine (i am sorry i forgot his name), kids club were great , they accompanied my kids to play ( thanks to Reza and Maya), they even give my kids t-shirt from Jw marriot. The BF has many variations , staffs are responsive to any your request. Old fashioned but they still keep their standart as five stars hotel. We will surely come back again."

"229.","John Towning","34","2024-01-01","5","A special thanks to Johan at breakfast, Sujito and his friend for room service, who looked after us while we were staying at the hotel. All the staff were excellent but these people mentioned sprung to my mind. Breakfast was the best I have had in Indonesia which came with good variations and different tastes to try using good quality food. For sure the price for the room is slightly higher than the other hotels but this price comes with a high quality and standard which is well worth the price. For sure we will return when visiting Surabaya. Thank you."

Untuk sarapannya juga enak. Hanya saja sedikit notes, untuk pelayanan di resto pas hari pertama langsung di tawarin kopi atau teh. Anak saya pun di berikan balon dan juga ditawarin mainan. Namun pas hari kedua cuman dicariin tempat duduk tanpa di tawarin teh atau kopi. Padahal tamu setelah saya ditawarin. Akhirnya saya minta sendiri ke waitersnya. Sedikit mengecewakan sih kalau masih ada oknum yg membeda bedakan tamu kayak gini."
"231.","Daniel Haoe","67","2024-01-01","5","Hotel terbaik menurut saya sejauh ini saya mencoba hotel2 disurabaya. Staff baik dan ramah, sangat helpful sekali sama permintaan dan request2 saya. Free shuttle ke TP juga diseduakan disini. Untuk rooms rapi bersih apalagi ada control panel di sebelah ranjang untuk semua lampu. Fasilitas juga sangat oke, apalagi ada sauna yg panasnya oke, hanya saja tidak ada cold pool saja. Breakfast sangat memanjakan mulut. Dengan varian berbagai macam makanan dari indonesian sampai italianpun ada. Overall so worth it !! Will come back here again !!"
"232.","Lidia Indriyani","175","2025-01-01","4","Hotel JW Marriott bisa dibilang strategis karena berada di pusat kota Surabaya , tempatnya nyaman , pegawainya bisa dibilang ramah meskipun tetap menjaga keluar masuknya tamu diberlakukan pemeriksaan seperti masa pas covid . Lobby dan ballroom hotel luas serta elegant , kamar hotel bisa dibilang bersih , nyaman , kamar mandipun bersih . Pokoknya menginap disini 2 hari bisa tidur pulas karena memang nyaman tempatnya . Menu sarapan pagi juga kompilt bervariasi , mungkin yang perlu ditingkatkan lagi rasa masakan biar tamu lebih dimanjakan lidahnya , berkesan sekali yaitu es creamnya super duper enak pas sekali rasanya dilidah kita . Semoga kedepannya Hotel JW Marriot tetap eksis dan tetap menjaga jebersihan dan kenyamanannya ."

Tiba2 sehabis shalat subuh alarm gempa berbunyi. Kami panik turun dari lt 5 lwt tangga emergency. Tetapi setiba di lobby FO tidak ada 1 pun petugas. Sampai para tamu berkumpul. Kemudian dijelaskan oleh manager on duty bahwa ada anak2 yg menarik alarm kebakaran. Menurut kami tdk masuk akal alasannya."

Kamar yang saya tempati sangat luas, elegan, dan bersih dengan semua kenyamanan modern. Saya merasa nyaman dan tenang setiap kembali ke kamar setelah city trip di Surabaya. Makanan di restoran hotel benar-benar nikmat. Sarapan dengan banyak pilihan hidangan lokal dan internasional selalu membuat saya mengawali hari dengan penuh antisipasi. Selain itu pelayanan kamar juga cepat dan makanan yang disajikan tetap enak. Selama saya menginap, saya sempat menikmati fasilitas hotel, seperti kolam renang yang indah dan gym modern. Staf hotel sangat perhatian dan membantu dalam memberikan informasi tentang objek wisata Surabaya. Hotel JW Marriott Surabaya menawarkan saya sebagai turis pengalaman yang tak terlupakan. Saya merekomendasikan hotel ini kepada siapa pun yang mencari akomodasi mewah dan layanan berkualitas di kota ini. Pengalaman saya di sini membuat saya ingin kembali ke Surabaya dan menginap lagi di hotel yang indah ini."

After staying at Westin for 4 nights, this felt slightly short on quality of food and service like sushi has no fish on top. Lounge was very busy and pool was packed. Nice but prefer to stay in Westin next time."

"268.","Kusuma YF","389","2024-01-01","5","Sedang ada kerjaan di Surabaya dan alhamdulillah diinapkan di hotel JW Marriot karena memang uda dari dulu request hotel ini. 1. lokasi lokasinya sangat strategis karena berada d pusatnya kota surabaya. Selain itu berada d jalan utama dimana jalan tersebut merupakan salah satu tempst kuliner legendaris khas Surabaya yaitu Rawon Setan. Trus juga dekat dg salah satu mall terbesar dan legendaris di Surabaya yaitu Tunjungan Plaza. So g bakal bosen nginap disini karena bisa melakukan banyak aktivitas ketika kerjaan sudah selesai. 2. Harga dan kamar. untuk harga sih memang lumayan mahal tp y sesuai la dengan lokasi dan fasilitas yang didapat. Tapi jika suatu perusahaan bekerja sama dg hotel ini bisa dapat dg harga terjangkau bgt. Waktu itu saya dapat harga di bawah Rp. 1.5jtaan padahal di aplikasi traveloka harganya Rp. 2jtaan. 3. fasilitas fasilitas hotel jg lengkap ada kolam renang yg lumayan besar di lantai 4 trus masih d area yg sama ada taman2 jg jd bs sekalian bersantai. Selain itu ada area gym jg. Trus dlantai bawah ada resto yg besar jg dan istagramable trus dekat tempat check in ada toko yg berjualan kue durian yg enak bgt. Harga kuenya Rp. 40.000/pcs. Dan d toko itu kita bs pesan kopi jg jd berasa d kafe cm y itu hrganya y harga hotel. Trus liftnya jg banyak jd g bakal antri dg pengunjung yg lain. Trus jg area parkir jg luas jd g perlu khawatir. 4. kebersihan kebersihan sangat terjaga baik d loby, kolam renang, kamar dll. pertahankan demikian pengalaman yg bs sy bagikan. semoga dapat bermanfaat buat teman2 yg mau berkunjung."

I really appreciate it. The staff was helpful and pleasant. The room suffers from inadequate ventilation, unfortunately. I think they should check whether all the amenities have been provided since I didn't find the razor. Being a foreigner, I had to visit the convenience store and buy it myself. Although it may seem trivial, it is critical to a guests from other countries."

"273.","dewi ayu","6","2024-01-01","1","JW Marriott only in name. This hotel is indeed nice and luxurious, but for its cleanliness I was very disappointed. Why is that, one time I ate there with friends. There were lots of flies in the buffet area, even though this hotel was famous for its good service but it became bad because the waiters didn't pay attention to cleanliness. Why doesn't this 5 star hotel pay attention to details for service and cleanliness, including food. I am very disappointed with this incident, I hope that in the future the hotel can improve the quality of service and cleanliness."

"276.","Mike Dodge","116","2025-01-01","2","Not the worst, but certainly not up to the normal standards of a JW Marriott-brand hotel. It's quite overpriced for Indonesia, and the hotel is quite old. As a result, the rooms are not always functioning, have some nasty smells, and have seen a lot of wear and tear over the years. I was unable to sleep due to the lack of AC and the mold smell in the room. The service is also quite bad, unfortunately, especially the food and beverage staff, which make breakfast a nightmare... Even by Indonesian standards, this hotel misses the mark. If you have elite status, the lounge is excellent, as are the facilities like the pool area, sauna, jacuzzi, etc. However, if you have stayed at another JW property in the world and expect this hotel to be similar, you will probably be disappointed. There other better hotels in the area that cost only half of what this hotel costs, so I'd recommend avoiding it unless you need a short stay near Tunjungan and don't care much about the quality or price."

Kebetulan dapat nya lantai atas, jadi lumayan bagus view nya. Apalagi saat sunrise dan sunset. Dekat dengan jalan tunjungan, jadi lumayan seru malam nya. Cuman aku gak tau y, apakah kolam renang nya cuman ada outdor? Secara pribadi aku berharap ada kolam renang indor gitu, atau aku yg gak tau? Karna kolam renang nya outdor, jd kurang nyaman sih menurutku. Selain ini, ok banget. Fasilitas jg lumayan lengkap. Tambahan nilai plus buat pelayanannya, ada kejadian kemaren t day 1 period ku. Pelayannya sedia pads dan diantar k kamar. Thx banget."

"280.","rani rahma","2","2024-01-01","1","Terrible F&B service for a 5* Hotel. First impressions of this hotel are classic & nice. Everything was fine apart from the food. i didn’t expect to have flies on my food. I think its indoor, so flies can’t be around except the food is not fresh. The staff didn't care about this either. This called 5 star hotel, but didn’t pay attention to things like this."
"281.","Marsyita Mohtar","218","2025-01-01","4","I recently stayed at JW Marriott Hotel Surabaya in August for a relaxing family trip and overall, the experience was delightful. The hotel's ambience is classy and luxurious, and the smooth airport pickup set the tone for our stay. We stayed in a Junior Suite with Executive Lounge access, and the room was clean, comfortable, and lush, as expected. Room service was prompt, and the service at the hotel restaurants and Executive Lounge was stellar. The gym was well-equipped, and I particularly enjoyed the sauna. My traditional massage with Therapist Sara was phenomenal—her magic fingers truly worked wonders! The food generally exceeded expectations, although the roast at dinner was a bit dry. I also had a fun time at the pool with my nephew and niece, who loved playing with the available pool toys. However, there were a few areas where the hotel could improve. The pre-arrival service felt lacking; as a 5-star hotel, I expected a more intuitive, service-oriented approach, but I had to seek clarifications and follow up several times before confirming our itinerary. The welcome service, while thoughtful with the kueh lapis, elephant towel origami, and personal note, fell short of the stellar experience I've had at other JW Marriott properties, where guests are often welcomed with personalized touches like special amenities or an in-depth welcome briefing. Overall, our stay was relaxing and enjoyable, but I look forward to seeing the hotel elevate its pre-arrival and welcome experiences to truly match its prestigious reputation."

It was quite old i can tell from the furniture and style but its very acceptable I cant complain. Bed is big enough and comfy, pillow is just too soft for my preference. And i asked to have an extra pillow and they cater to my request very quick. Someone send me a more full pillow. Everything is just up to our standards. Great service by one of the staff named Aditya (or Adityo) who tend to our room and he made sure we had everything we need. Breakfast was delicious with so many options. Gym was okay, not big, mot small.. just enough to train a bit here and there. But location is near tunjungan mall where they have a mega gym there."

Yg kurang cuma di kolam renang. Saya rasa lebih oke kalau kamar gantinya di kasih fasilitas bilasan, bukan outdoor gitu. Soalnya bagi yg berhijab pengen membersihkan diri setelah renang tp nggak bisa. Alhasil belum mandi ganti baju dan naik ke kamar. Tp overall oke bgt. Kami mempertimbangkan untuk kembali lagi if there’s a chance :)"

Immediately wow with the promotion...not really. At 14.00, you enter the room and start working, don't pay attention to your surroundings and go straight to bed. The next day after breakfast, I wanted to take a shower, found foam to clean the glass (apparently) in the shower room (I was told to clean the glass myself, apparently). And as soon as the shower was switched on, the paint on the walls and grout on the floor started to come off. Immediately the second wow... Hopefully there won't be a third wow, I still have 5 more nights to stay here."

"304.","Dhani Prakoso","3","2025-01-01","5","We stayed at the JW Marriott Surabaya to celebrate my birthday anniversary. I made the reservation through the Marriott Bonvoy application and chose the Family by JW package. This package was perfect for us since we got breakfast for my wife, daughter, and me. We also got a tent in our room, a gelato, a cupcake decorating class, and some gifts for my daughter. During the check-in process, the front office staff were helpful. Ms. Lydia helped me in the check-in process. Almost all of our pre-arrival requests were accommodated. Our check-out process was seamless also. Ms. Afdilla assisted us during the process. We visited the SBCo bakery and cake shop to buy pastries, slice cakes, and gelato. The staff in the shop were friendly. Ms. Fera was very nice, she gave us a gelato and a box of macaroons as a complimentary for my birthday. Ms. Fia helped us when we bought some slice cakes. She explained the pastries and the cakes at the shop very well. She was helpful. The other staff, Ms. Feny and Nata, were also nice and helpful, they helped my daughter when she took the cupcake decorating class. The chef who assisted my daughter when she took the cupcake decorating class was patient. She could communicate well in English (considering my daughter can only understand English). I was not sure her name, but she was an intern. The shop offers delicious pastries and cakes and has great hospitality. Those are some of the reasons why we kept visiting the SBCo. We had breakfast at the Pavillion restaurant during our stay at the hotel. Ms. Indah always greeted us at the restaurant’s front desk. She was nice and helpful. She explained about the restaurant’s lunch and dinner packages, and allowed us to look around the restaurant to check the food menus they served during lunchtime. We received complimentary dishes, Rawon and Beef Oxtail soup, from Chef Sigit. The rawon was perfect. The meat was tender and the broth was delicious. The Beef Oxtail soup was great and delicious also. They used real oxtails which is very important. And the meat was tender and fall-off the bone. The carrots were perfectly cooked, it was cooked but still crunchy. The broth was light. Chef Endra also came to our table asking about the dishes, we had discussion about some restaurants and food with him. Mr. Asat was nice and friendly. He arranged for me to get a complimentary strawberry opera cake for my birthday with a candle on a plate with a “Happy Birthday” decoration. The other staff, Mr. Guntur and Ms. Munzia were attentive throughout our breakfast time in the restaurant. They were quick to take empty dishes from our table and offered water refill every time our glass were almost empty. The food at this restaurant was delicious overall. Special compliments to the staff, chef Sigit, and chef Endra. I also visited the health club several times. The staff (Mr. Suhadi, Mr. Anang, and Mr. Kevin) were friendly and helpful. They explained their facilities, and how to use the jacuzzi and the steam room to me. They also helped me to turn on the jacuzzi and the steam room. At the bar near the pool, I met Mr. Prima. He explained the hotel facilities and gave tips on which food we should try in the Pavillion restaurant. On Sunday, we had a chance to visit the Uppercut restaurant to get information and see their Sunday brunch set-up and menu. The staff lady who explained the menu and the information about the Sunday brunch was very friendly. Unfortunately, I didn’t see her name. This restaurant could be our next place to visit. One thing I might suggest is to renew the name tags of the hotel staff. Some of the staff’s name tags had their names almost erased. Overall, our stay in the JW Marriott Surabaya was enjoyable. The staff had great hospitality and impeccable service. We will visit this hotel again another day."

"308.","Marmut -","101","2024-01-01","5","Staycation sama suami & anak² di hotel ini, ambil paket Family by JW, tipe kamar Deluxe room. Kamarnya luas, ada bath up even di tipe kamar yg paling rendah. Ada tenda di dlm kamar untuk anak². Tapi tendanya di luar ekspektasi saya. Karena saya pikir tendanya bisa dibuat anak² tiduran atau main². Ternyata tendanya kecil, gak cukup buat masuk 2 anak. Untuk aktivitas cukup memuaskan. Di area swimming pool ada disediakan popcorn dan cotton candy gratis untuk anak² (weekend only). Ada ruangan untuk nonton film juga (agak panas karena terbuka). Kids club gak terlalu besar. Anak² yang masuk wajib berkaos kaki tapi tidak ada tulisan di pintu masuknya. Jadi tiba² pas masuk, petugasnya baru bilang kalau harus pakai kaos kaki. Kalau beli di sana, ukurannya gak lengkap dan harganya agak pricey. Di dalam kids clubnya gak ada petugasnya, jadi anak² main sendiri, maka wajib diawasi sendiri. Di paket Family by JW ada fasilitas baking class untuk anak² minimal usia 3 tahun. Anak² diajari cara bikin cookies oleh chefnya. Kemudian hasil cookiesnya bisa dibawa pulang. Sungguh menyenangkan karena anak² banyak aktivitas. Restoran untuk makan pagi (Pavillion) cukup luas di area belakang dan AC nya dingin. Varian makanan lumayan banyak, rasanya pun enak. Semua staff friendly dan helpful. Lokasi hotelnya bagus, dekat tempat makan. Tinggal nyebrang atau jalan ke Tidar uda nemu banyak penjual makanan. Dekat juga dengan Alfamart, Indomaret, dan Lawson."

Tidak hanya mendapatkan kamar luas, bersih, dan komplit perlengkapannya, wifi juga lancar. Di kamar kami ada handuk yg dilipat berbentuk gajah, dan ada kartu bertulisan tangan dari cleaner yg menyampaikan bahwa ia senang membersihkan kamar kami. Sentuhan personal yg menyenangkan. Kolam renang luas dan bersih. Ada area untuk jogging juga di sekitarnya. Ada bantal kolam renang besar yg bisa digunakan. Sofa2 / kursi kolam renang di sekeliling kolam renang juga bersih dan nyaman. Resto, wah jangan ditanya. Variasi makanan banyak, lengkap, dan enak2 sekali. Buah dan jus dipotong dan dibuat di depan kita, jadi segar sekali. Dan tentunya ada banyak makanan lain yg juga disiapkan langsung di hadapan kita, memberikan rekreasi mata yg menyenangkan. Pada saat kami selesai makan, salah satu staf mengajak mengobrol. Saat kami menyampaikan bahwa kami akan melakukan perjalanan darat ke Jawa Barat hari itu juga, ia langsung menyampaikan bahwa ia membungkuskan beberapa potong roti untuk kami bawa di jalan. Ia juga memberikan voucher untuk cookies gratis atau diskon kue 25% di SBCo. Sungguh servis yang sangat menyenangkan. Lain kali kalau ke Surabaya lagi, pasti akan kami sempatkan lagi menginap di sini."

Saya berasumsi itu tempat tinggal anjing hotel (biasa kita temui saat masuk area hotel). Saya tidak melihat detail ke dalam, tetapi terdengar dari luar, bahkan di jarak yg cukup jauh, suara exhaust yg sangat berisik. Lokasi exhaust berada bersebrangan dengan tempat anjing tsb. Kita tahu anjing memiliki pendengaran yg sangat tajam dibanding manusia. Saya kuatir hal ini dapat mengganggu kesehatan pendengaran yg berpengaruh buruk pada kesejahteraan hewan.. Mohon diperhatikan lebih mengenai hal ini.. Jika hotel memakai hewan untuk membantu dalam operasionalnya, maka wajib memikirkan kesejahteraan mereka juga!"

"329.","wii telo","8","2022-01-01","5","Excellent service. Staycation di masa pandemi ini sangat menyenangkan, apalagi dengan pelayanan hotel bintang 5 yang benar-benar luar biasa. Reservasi by phone hari Sabtu 6 Januari 2021 siang jam 12.00, kebetulan ada promo 1 night stay 850rb nett (include breakfast). Langsung kami setujui reservasi hari itu juga dan pukul 14.00 kami datang ke hotel. Akses terbatas, mobil disambut petugas security dan anjing pelacak untuk melakukan prosedur keamanan. Tiba di lobby suami saya parkir (area parkiran terbuka, cukup luas, tetapi agak jauh dari lobby), saya masuk dengan prosedur keamanan ala hotel bintang 5 pada umumnya, check in dan langsung bayar 850rb via debit card (pembayaran lunas tidak dikenai biaya jaminan 150rb), harga yang dikenakan sesuai yang diinfokan by phone, 850rb nett (dah include tax). Koper dibawakan bell boy hingga kamar sambil nunggu suami dr parkiran. Kamarnya terletak di lantai 17 (deluxe king city view, nonsmoking) . Benar2 nyaman dan bersih. Seperti biasa kami cek kebersihan tempat tidur, di atas tempat tidur diberikan hygiene kit (masker 2, tisu basah 2, handsanitizer spry mini). Semua komplit fasilitas kamarnya (check) walaupun diskonan :p. Selesai menata dan ganti baju renang kami langsung menuju ke lt 4 (gym dan pool, jaccuzzie tutup selama pandemi). Kolam renang gak terlalu luas tp lumayanlah, di tengah kota surabaya gitu. Pengunjung lumayan lah, kami renang sambil tetep jaga jarak dan 3M (secara covid ga nular di air kolam tp dr barang2 sekitaran kolam). Kalau pas ga nyebur kami maskeran, jadi kit yang isi masker tadi langsung kami bawa). Handuk dah disediakan di sana, petugasnya sebentar2 nanyain butuh handuk apa enggak. Kolam renang seger, cuma emang beberapa spot kaya dinding batunya agak berlumut. Kursi santai dan payung pantainya banyak, ga sah kuatir buat naruh2 barang dll. Overall nyaman kolam renangnya. Jam 19.00 kita rencana mau keluar ke TP cari makan, tetiba ada pelayanan yang nganter welcome snack gorengan (6 biji) dan petis. Trus kita ke TP, sayang banget jam 8 udah tutup (ada PPKM), pas nyampe di lobby lagi kita dikasih info sama petugas resto pavillion kalo ada promo dinner di resto pavillion pay one for two (420rb nett) WAHHH, sayang banget kita dah makan di TP (T.T), dah kenyang. Tahu gitu kan makan disana dah oke banget ga keburu2 jam 8 tutup. Ya sudah, belom rejeki. Akhirnya kita balik kamar dan menikmati istirahat dan suasana city view. Paginya kita breakfast di pavillion. Menunya komplit (western ,chinese, japanese, dan indonesia), sayang kalo rasanya masih kurang nendang, masih perlu diimprove lagi. Tapi dari segi variasi udah oke. Yang aku suka ada beras kencurnya enak banget, sampe abis 2 gelas (haha) jadi ada kaya mbak2 jualan jamu, pake keranjang juga gitulah. Asik. Kita ngabisin waktu di sana sampe jam 9.30, resto buka jam 6. Rencana mau renang lagi tp dah panas, jadi kita balik kamar langsung. Check out jam 12.00 seperti pada umumnya. Secara keseluruhan aku dan suami puas banget dengan pelayanan, fasilitas dan kebersihan di hotel ini. Pros: Bersih, pelayanan ramah banget, tiap ketemu pegawainya 3S (ga ada yang merengut), pegawai hampir semua good looking, fasilitas komplit walaupun harga promo. Apakah bakalan nginep lagi next time? Yaps, pastinya. Cons: Parkiran terbuka (repot kalau hujan), jauh dari lobby, pool outdoor, perlu diinfokan lagi buat customer yang nginep kalo ada promo2 dinner dll. Terima kasih atas pelayanannya."

Dapat kamar di lantai 20, Untuk amenities sangat lengkap (comb razor included) dan dapat sanitize kit juga masker 2 dan hand sanitizer. Untuk kamar masih terawat dengan baik, lengkap sekali ada sofa santai, kursi kerja dan bed. Untuk kasur masih enak, tapi bantalnya sudah agak kempos. Wifi sebenarnya cepat tapi login pagenya lemot nda connect2. TV lengkap dan banyak channel. Air panas deras, ada bathtubnya dan pengisiannya cepat. Shower deras. Bisa betah mandi disini. Swimming pool dan gym buka. Untuk gym alatnya lengkap dan swimming pool lumayan luas tapi berkelok2. Untungnya landscape di sekitar kolam renang enak buat jalan2 dan foto. Breakfastnya lengkap dan enak Untuk variannya ada : 1. Salad dan dressing 2. Sushi 3. Indonesian food (empal, tahu tempe kare, nasi, tahu tek) dan kerupuk 4.

"338.","Anita Nursia","239","2022-01-01","3","Ini kunjungan kedua kali ke Marriot dan semakin memantapkan hati untuk tidak memilih hotel ini di masa datang. Nama besar dan bintang 5 tidak sebanding dengan layanannya. Entah pegawainya kurang pelatihan atau tidak pernah dievaluasi, sehingga pelayanannya sangat tidak sesuai dengan ekpektasi, jauh di bawah hotel bintang 4, bahkan bintang 3. Jika dibandingkan dengan hotel selevel yang terletak di Tunjungan yg masih satu manajemen Marriot Bonvoy, sangat jauh bedanya. Menginap kali ini melewati lobby luar terkesan kotor karena daun2 kering bertebaran, suasana lobby yg crowded, dan kamar saya tidak sesuai harapan: kulkas rusak, tdk ada setrika di lemari spt biasanya. Saluran TV menghilang berjam2 dan ketika menelpon ke guest service tidak ada permintaan maaf walau sekedar basa basi. Layanan di resto tidak lebih baik, mereka menawarkan teh dan kopi, tapi ketika sy menanyakan minuman herbal, staf resto hanya menunjukkan tempatnya tanpa menawarkan untuk mengambil. Apa bedanya mengambil teh/kopi dan minuman herbal? Hari kedua saya turun ke resto jam 8.30 dlm keadaan lapar, namun staf menjelaskan resto penuh dan disarankan datang kembali jam 10 an. Dengan terpaksa saya kembali ke kamar dan mengganjal dengan semangkuk popmie. Jam 10 saya turun kembali dan resto memang longgar, namun blm setengah jam petugas mendatangi meja dan mengatakan resto akan tutup jam 10.30 tanpa basa basi. Saya sering diingatkan ketika sarapan di resto hampir tutup, tapi caranya disampaikan dengan lebih baik, tidak seperti Marriot. Bukan salah saya turun jam 10 dan kelaparan, tidak bisakan mereka melatih staf mereka lebih baik? Ini hotel bintang 5 tapi layanan sangat tidak layak. Hanya mengejar uang tanpa perbaikan layanan dan perbaikan fasilitas."

"340.","Dennis Keller","24","2021-01-01","4","Overall very nice. Rooms are spacious and very affordable. We stayed at the 1 bedroom suite, with great views over the city. Given covid and reduced capacity the executive lounge was closed and instead at the lobby lounge. It gets a bit busy there in the evenings, and unfortunately quite smokey. The pool area is relaxing, green and nice. It would have been perfect if there was a bar, or at least a service to order drinks/snacks. Everyone is very friendly, and service overall was good. On one day the internet was very slow. Called to ask and was ensured the staff would check with the technician and call back. I also asked about spa services and the Platinum benefits, and after being on the phone waiting loop for 5 minutes I hung up. Never received a call back. No big deal, but I'd expect attention to detail at a 5 star property, and at least basic service such as calling back when you say you call back. Room is very comfortable and clean. Overall the hotel feels a bit old. I was very surprised the the valet parking was charged at a fee for hotel guests. Perhaps consider making that complementary, at the very least for Gold/Platinum members?"

Masak sekelas hotel mewah, kebersihannya tidak terjaga dan diperhatikan dengan detail oleh manajemen hotelnya. Kalau seperti ini, makanannya jadi tidak Higienis dan terkesan sangat jorok, jijik. Tolong lah, lain kali agar selalu diperhatikan hal detail semacam ini."

Lokasi hotel sangat strategis, dikelilingi beberapa spot Kuliner Tradisional (Rawon Setan dll), serta berdekatan dengan Tunjungan Plaza Surabaya.

Hope that they could do something with the AC in the room 620 for real. Cause that time I was very happy they could gave us rooms that next to each other as we requested the very first time we checked in but in the end me and my son had to moved quite far from my parents room.

Tempatnya nyaman, waktu dtg di resepsionis tidak hanya di suguhkan welcome drink tapi juga handuk dingin. Bisa buat mengusap wajah jadi lebih segar krn cuaca disurabaya cukup panas. Welcome service yg bagus dan sptnya sy blm menemukan di hotel manapun. Reseptionis dan semua staff juga ramah. Kamarnya excelent Breakfastnya macam2 dan enak2😊 Kemarin saya kebetulan coba roti KING BREAD nya. Mrk bilang rotinya ini best seller dan favorit sehingga tdk ada potongan diskon walaupun menjelang malam Ada yg ukuran medium dan jumbo. Roti isi durian (bukan esense) ini boleh di coba. Harganya 35.000. Love it Bread lovers, yg 1 ini patut dicoba. Sepertinya hanya ada di JW Marriot"

Seluruh staf ramah, front office (ibu Sri) dapat menghandle request dengan baik. Di hari pertama minta smoking room, namun karena type deluxe untuk smoking room hanya terdapat di lantai rendah akhirnya di hari kedua minta pindah ke kamar non smoking room dapat di lantai tinggi dengan pool & city view. Untuk breakfast buffet namun tidak selengkap saat sebelum pandemi. Namun masih bisa request menu yang diinginkan dan semua rasa makanan enak. Jam 20.00 Deli Shop harga rotinya diskon 50% dan enak-enak juga rasanya. Pool & fitness centre buka, namun untuk sore hari area sekitar pool dibakai bukber dengan tema Ramadhan After Sunset.

JW Marriott is one of the 5 star hotels in Surabaya, but the service provided is unsatisfactory, you could even say it's like an ordinary hotel service. When having lunch there, my gaze went straight to the food. Cook in this luxury hotel. Not paying attention to the cleanliness of the food place, lots of flies alight on the food, not just one of the dishes, some of the food provided is also landed on by flies. This is not hygienic at all, especially since those who eat there are old people and even children. Is the food being served not fresh or is the cleanliness neglected, so that flies can infest it?"

Yang saya sukai dari hotel ini adalah menu sarapan yang bervariasi dan berganti menu setiap harinya. Kolam renang yang sangat nyaman dan aman untuk anak-anak.Lokasi hotelnya udah pasti di pusat kota, yang deket kemana2. Megah dengan segala fasilitas yang lengkap. Kamarnya besar dan view nya bagus banget. Makanannya komplit dan sangat bervariasi, tema tempat breakfast nya seperti rumah kaca. Pelayannya ramah dan makanannya enak2.

"392.","intan nirmala","219","2020-01-01","5","JW Marriot Surabaya, Hotel bernuansa Eropa yang berlokasi di jantung kota Surabaya. Tidak sampai 1 km dari Mall Tunjungan Plaza atau setara kurang lebih 11 ribu kalau naik grabcar. Di sekitar hotel juga terdapat menu kuliner beragam, semisal Rawon Setan, Martabak Orins, Ikan Bakar Panorama, Tahu Campur, dsb. Saya juga sering go food bebek sinjay, tidak terlalu jauh dari lokasi hotel. Ga perlu takut kelaparan kalo menginap disini. Terdapat beberapa pilihan kamar, reguler, eksekutif, dan juga president suite. Kamar cukup luas (baik reguler atau diatasnya) dan fasilitasnya oke. The best part dari hotel ini menurut saya adalah kasurnya! Iya kasurnya itu empuk banget, mungkin sebangsa king k*il berbulu angsa. Bantal sama selimut nya juga lembut banget. Saking noraknya, sampe coba sengaja berdiri tegak lalu menjatuhkan diri kekasur, berasa main trampolin, mantul! Namun, beberapa kali kesini, kadang-kadang dapat kasur yang ga se-soft itu juga sih. Faktor keberuntungan mungkin. Terakhir menginap disini, rela extend ambil flight after check out, biar lamaan tenggelam dikasurnya. Dari segi makanan, hotel ini menyajikan cukup banyak variasi kuliner, mulai dari sajian khas indonesia dan juga mancanegara. Kualitas rasa enak dan terfavorit yang ditunggu tunggu adalah si item es krim charcoal - nya. Yummy.. Apa yang tidak saya suka adalah hotel ini kamarnya agak remang, saya sih ga berani tidur sendirian disini. Kalau sama temen apalagi suami, baru deh betah haha."

"406.","Derek Ang","108","2025-01-01","3","First and foremost I would like to thank Karen for making the best effort as well as the lounge team for their hospitality but please allow me to share some of my feedback. While the staff have been accommodating and trying their level best but the processes and property is really in need of major overhaul - considering it bears the brand of a JW Marriott, supposedly a level above an ordinary Marriott. I had provided feedback that my original room 2408 air-con wasn't really cold despite setting it to the coldest setting. Room was tired and worn out with cracking door frames, lack of charging and power sockets. The room I was being changed to was 2411 which had slightly better temperature setting in the room but was even worse as the curtain bears holes that let the sun in early in the morning and had dirty water pipes that poured out sand and murky water into the bath tub. During check in I was asked if I would be settling my bill and I said sure! But little did I know this meant I was not allowed to make purchases at any of the outlets. Despite being a member with a valid credit card used for reservation on my profile and also a fully settled room charges. Uppercut was disappointing as I was served a 2 day old Sauvignon Blanc that was flat and food was also mediocre - prawn that wasn't really fresh (black and slimy) as well as mussels that were not even opened. But staff was apologetic and friendly, the chef should bear responsibility of the standards being served as it's not the front of house's duty to apologise for poorly cooked food. While the lounge staff was really friendly and hardworking, but to be served Bloody Mary only on the first day but be told that it was not available was quite disappointing for an executive lounge. All in all, staff are genuinely the redeeming factor of the hotel. But the Management and the leadership team really need to wake up and start to work in making the hotel a JW and not just your everyday Marriott which is already a compliment. Because it's actually way below the standard of even a Marriott brand hotel. All in all, an absolutely disappointment of a JW Marriott and to be honest I should have stayed at the Sheraton instead."

Tanggapan manajemen juga kurang, kami komplain justru ditawari mengumpulkan poin2 agar tetap menginap di hotel dengan service buruk yg tidak sepadan dengan harganya ini. Kebersihan juga kurang.

Saya tanggal 14 januari saya pesan lewat agoda, transaksi sesuai prosedur agoda dengan menggunakan kartu kredit citibank dengan jumlah tagihan Rp 1.540.000,- tanggal 15 januari siang saya melakukan proses check in di hotel. disini saya di layani reception dengan nama Lsari orangnya sangat ketus, cara bicara sangat tidak sopan dan meminta kita untuk membayar ulang tagihan penginapan kita dengan alasan bahwa sistem pembayaran tersebut harus pay at property dan uang yang sudah kita bayarkan di agoda adalah uang jaminan menginap, what jaminan sejumlah kamar hotel, biaya menginap 1.694.000 dan jaminan sebanyak 1.540.000 yang katanya tidak akan ditagihakn karena hanya sebagai jaminan ????? karena terlalu berbelit si receptionnya dan membuat kita kesal juga, akhirnya kita putuskan untuk melakukan pembayaran saja itu tagihan dengan kartu kredit BCA sejumlah 1.694.000 setelah selesai transaksi si reception menyerahkan kunci kamar kita dengan muka judes/cemberut dan tanpa ucapan hangat (salam atau terima kasih) tanggal 15 januari sore saat kita beristirahat betapa kagetnya kita karena menerima notifikasi sms dari citibank telah terjadi transaksi dari JW MARRIOT sebesar 1.694.000. pertama saya telp pihak citibank drngan Pak Malik yang menyatakan bahwa transaksi berhasil (tanpa saya menyerahkan kartu, karena kartu saya tinggal dirumah) saya menceritakan kronologi dan kata cs citibank bahwa ada penyalagunaan kartu kredit. 1. bagaimana bisa JW MARRIOT menarik uang kartu citibank saya tanpa ada fisik kartu ? 2. bagaimana cara JW MARRIOT menarik uang melebihi batas yang saya transaksi di agoda (jika sebagai jaminan) ? saya transaksi di agoda sebesar 1.540.000 sedangkan JW MARRIOT manarik sebesar 1.694.000 3. apakah data kita aman di agoda ? tanggal 15januari malam saya mendatangi lagi reception dan manager menghadap ke saya menjelaskan bahwa pihak hotel mohon maaf ada double payment yang dilakukan. untuk transaksi kedua (citibank) itu dijelaskan bahwa pihak hotel mengira kita tidak datang ke hotel dan pihak hotel memiliki kuasa menarik dana yang ada di kartu yang telah diserahkan/diinput ke agoda (agoda menyerahkan data kartu kredit kita ke hotel dong? kalau iya bahaya juga dong !) 4. apakah aman data kartu kredit saya ? bagaimana jika suatu saat ada penarikan ilegal dr pihak JW MARRIOT karena memiliki data kartu kredit saya ? tanggal 16 januari pagi saya telp dengan Lsari lagi dan berkata bahwa kita kekurangan membayaran biaya tax sebesar 10% dan saya diminta untuk kembali ke reception dan membayar tax nya kembali dengan nada yang tidak sopan, menekan dan kurang ajar !!! mana ada hotel yang setiap hari meminta uang ke konsumernya ? saya merasa seperti diperas di hotel ini ! sangat kecewa 5. Siapakah sebenarnya Lsari ini ? pegawai apa dia sebenarnya ?? kenapa melakukan pemerasan ke pelanggannya ?? 6. apakah pegawai JW Marriot tidak di training sebelum melayani pelanggan ?? NOTE: nama di seragam NENY, sedangkan nama di invoice Lsari ?? 7. kenapa nama pegawai di JW Marriott seakan disamarkan ? ada maksud apakah sebenarnya ?"

Sore hari sekitar jam 18 saya coba telp JW Marriot dan yang menerima mungkin Operator/Receptionist seorang wanita namanya tidak begitu jelas. Begitu saya minta di sambungkan ke kamar 1003, sang operator dengan lantang menjawab kamar 1003 adalah kamar kosong tidak terisi siapapun sambil bengong saya bilang loh itu kamar belum check-out, apa pindah ke 1001 kah ? Kemudian di jawab lagi oh saya tidak bisa kasih tau, tanya saja langsung/hubungi ke HPnya. Saya merasa di Tipu ! Jika pun ada Regulasi incognito pun tidak serta merta membodohi saya sedemikian rupa.

"442.","Moch Chafidz","20","2019-01-21","1","- Saya datang dijam 13.30 tanggal 15 desember 2018 - Pengalaman pertama saya menggunakan motor ke JW Marriot - Tidak ada sign parkir motor/ kalaupun ada secara sepintas tidak terlihat - Parkir motor masuk ke jalan pengiriman barang (jalan sebelum jalan utama lobby utama) - Saya menggunakan baju biasa (dibawah standart tamu hotel) - Saya melewati penjagaan disuruh lepas helm dan buka bagasi motor dengan nada antara tegas atau kurang sopan, saya ikuti.. - Security menulis plat nomor saya didepan motor saya, setelah itu ditinggal berlalu saja, sontak saya tanyakan bagasi tidak dicek? Security bilang sudah.. padahal dia posisi didepan dan pasti gak bakal liat isi bagasi karena ketutup jok motor yg keatas (terbuka). Karena dicuekin saya langsung lihat keatas cari cctv sisi dimana jok saya bisa terlihat dan gak nemuin... Masa iya hotel bintang 5 gak ada cctv? Ooh mungkin krn bintang 5 cctvnya tersembunyi.. (Masih respect dan santai) - Kemudian saya sempet diam, mikir ini gak ditanya mau kemana? Ada keperluan apa? Langsung main berpaling saja, langsung saya tanya ke security yg tadi berpaling dimana lokasi parkir motor. Beliau kasih tahu, dan saya bilang terimakasih dan lanjut.. - saya parkir dan cuma ngasihkan oleh2 lanjut balik ke tempat parkir - Baliknya saya ke arah jalan keluar yang sama dengan arah masuk dengan kecepatan normalnya ditempat asing yg bukan saya kuasai, dimana saya ngerasa itu pelan (bisa cek cctv bila diperlukan), waktu melintas pos penjagaan saya tidak ada teguran untuk stop, saya juga benar2 gak liat sign utk berhenti dengan jelas utk pengecekan atau apalah. Disitu ada portal atau pagar yg benar2 terbuka sehingga saya dengan santai keluar.. Gak sampai di jalan trotoar, saya merasa dipanggil dengan panggilan serasa dipanggil ala preman, karena saya benar2 pelan, meskipun kepala saya tertutup helm, saya dengan jelas mendengar suara itu. Sontak saya liat kebelakang dan security2 itu benar2 memanggil ke arah saya, saya sempat memastikan kalau yg dipanggil itu saya atau yang lain karena saya liat sekitar gak ada orang lain sekitar saya. - Diperlakukan seperti itu sontak saya reflek ketawa dan kesal (ini lucu) karena saya merasa tidak salah, saya berhenti dan ingin kooperatif, saya tanya ada apa? Kenapa seperti ini? (heran dengan caranya memanggil) mereka meracau menyalahkan saya seakan saya itu penjahat, orang rendahan dan itu sangat tidak sopan. - Ternyata pada dasarnya security hanya minta stnk, ya saya kasih karena saya merasa benar dan lengkap. Dengan ngasih stnk saya cuma tertawa tawa doang, sambil berfikir, ini kalau saya beneran niat jahat pasti saya lolos, ini security hotel bintang 5 atau security hotel melati, ini security apakah gajinya sedikit dibanding hotel2 sebelah (hubungan kepuasan kerja dengan gaji pegawai) yang lebih hangat dan santun, kalau emang security sudah benar, mungkinkah saya yg baru pertama kali bisa lolos dengan mudah dari portal penjagaan. Bahkan salah satu dari mereka bilang saya melamun dan main nyelonong? Saya baru pertama kali kesini bos, anda kasih 5 jari ke arah saya saja, pasti saya akan berhenti hha atau anda anda berada ditengah dekat portal dengan bilang pak stnk... pasti saya juga akan berhenti.. saya benar2 gak paham ada ya security2 seperti ini di hotel bintang 5. Rasanya waktu dijalan bener2 ketawa. Kebetulan saya ada kerjaan yang mengurus tamu luar kota atau luar negeri untuk penginapan. Mungkin saya tidak akan pernah merekomendasikan hotel ini, mending di hotel yg ada dijalan nomor 25-31 embong malang, lebih dekat TP dan security lebih ramah hha - Semoga kritikan ini bisa dibaca para manajemen, khususnya keamanan, jadikan kritikan sebagai acuan untuk menjadi lebih baik lagi. - Jika ulasan saya dibilang mengada ngada bisa dilihat dicctvnya, diatas sendiri saya kasih waktu."

"518.","Adi Teguh","8","2026-01-07","1","Awal tahun yang seharusnya penuh sukacita berubah menjadi mimpi buruk pada tanggal 1 Januari 2026 karena layanan hotel yang mengecewakan. Sarapan disajikan di executive lounge, tetapi layanan yang diberikan sangat mengecewakan. Hanya tamu-tamu tertentu yang mendapat perhatian khusus, sementara meja saya sama sekali diabaikan—tidak ada layanan sama sekali, bahkan tawaran minuman pun tidak ada. Para staf berulang kali bolak-balik ke meja-meja di sebelah kanan, kiri, dan belakang saya untuk menawarkan minuman dan makanan, namun mereka tidak pernah datang ke meja saya. Piring-piring kotor di meja saya dibiarkan begitu saja, sementara meja di sebelahnya ditawari untuk membersihkan piring—padahal jarak antara meja saya dan meja sebelahnya hanya sekitar satu meter. Mereka hanya melayani tamu yang tampak kaya, jelas-jelas menilai orang berdasarkan penampilan mereka. Menghabiskan Tahun Baru di JW Marriott adalah mimpi buruk. Pengalaman ini membuka mata saya terhadap fakta bahwa hanya tamu yang tampak kaya yang menerima layanan yang layak. Selain itu, saluran pembuangan kamar mandi tersumbat, perlu menunggu sekitar 3 jam agar air di lantai benar-benar kering."
"519.","Deddy Cahyono","31","2025-09-21","1","Mohon maaf jika ulasan ini agak terlambat, tetapi saya yakin lebih baik terlambat daripada tidak sama sekali, terutama karena ini berfungsi sebagai umpan balik penting untuk evaluasi. Saya menginap sebagai tamu pada tanggal 16-17 Juni 2025. Saya ingin menyampaikan bahwa JW Marriott selalu menjadi pilihan favorit dan favorit bagi saya dan keluarga. Namun, pengalaman terakhir kami mengecewakan sekaligus sangat memprihatinkan. Anak saya hampir tenggelam di kolam renang karena tidak adanya penjaga pantai yang bertugas. Pada saat kritis itu, istri saya mencoba membantu tetapi tidak dapat melakukannya karena kedalaman kolam, sementara saya sedang berada di kamar untuk mengambil pakaian. Situasinya hampir fatal. Sungguh disayangkan bahwa hotel sekelas JW Marriott, dengan reputasi internasional yang begitu terpandang, tidak menyediakan pengawasan keamanan berkelanjutan di fasilitas kolam renangnya. Ini bukan kelalaian kecil, melainkan bahaya keselamatan serius yang membahayakan nyawa tamu. Kami menganggap ini sebagai pelanggaran mendasar terhadap standar layanan dan keselamatan yang seharusnya menjadi prioritas utama bagi hotel sekelas ini. Keselamatan adalah hal yang tak terelakkan, terutama di hotel kelas dunia seperti JW Marriott. Kami sangat berharap manajemen menyadari keseriusan masalah ini dan segera mengambil tindakan korektif, karena satu tindakan kelalaian saja dapat merenggut nyawa tamu."
"520.","Esti Rahayu","23","2025-08-21","1","Petugas pemeriksaan keamanan di hotel ini jelas-jelas diskriminatif. Pada tanggal 7 Agustus, saya pulang dari makan malam dan menyaksikan sekelompok orang yang datang dengan kendaraan mewah berjalan melewati pemindai sinar-X tanpa satu pun barang bawaan diperiksa. Namun, ketika saya mendekati area pemeriksaan yang sama, seorang petugas langsung meminta tas saya diperiksa. Ketika saya mengkonfrontasinya tentang kelompok yang baru saja diizinkan masuk, jawabannya adalah, Mereka hanya keluar sebentar. Saya pun, hanya keluar sebentar. Ini jelas merupakan kasus perlakuan selektif dan tidak adil, dan tidak ada alasan untuk kemunafikan semacam itu."
"521.","Joanne","9","2025-05-21","1","Pengalaman menginap yang sangat mengecewakan. Gangguan suara yang tidak dapat diterima jika kamar menghadap jalan. Kami terbangun pukul 4 pagi karena suara doa yang keras dari luar dan tidak bisa tidur lagi karena terus berlanjut hingga kami check out pukul 8 pagi. Pengalaman ini jauh dari tingkat kedamaian dan kenyamanan yang kami harapkan dari hotel bergengsi seperti JW Marriott. Staf hotel tidak menanggapi masalah tersebut meskipun kami melaporkannya saat check out atau melalui email. Yang kami dapatkan hanyalah pesan otomatis yang tidak berguna."
"522.","b_chattleya “Mrs. Michaela”","7","2025-02-21","1","Gerbang masuknya membingungkan, tanda atau petunjuk masuk hotel sulit terlihat. Saya harus putar balik lagi untuk masuk ke hotel. Tempat parkirnya kecil dan terbatas, dan tiket parkirnya seperti toko grosir murah. Pelayanan di lobi resepsionis membuat saya menunggu sangat lama (lebih dari 30 menit tanpa ada kemajuan). Kamarnya kurang bersih karena suami saya mulai bersin-bersin karena debu, dan kamarnya tidak kedap suara, suara dari jalan dan masjid di sekitar dapat terdengar dengan jelas dan keras. Ketika saya mengeluh tentang hal itu, pihak hotel tidak segera memperbaikinya dan tidak memberikan pujian apa pun. Saya tidak merekomendasikan hotel ini untuk siapa pun yang menginap di sini untuk waktu yang lama seperti kami."
"523.","dewi ayu","6","2024-01-21","1","JW Marriott hanya sebatas nama. Hotel ini memang bagus dan mewah, tapi untuk kebersihannya saya sangat kecewa. Kenapa begitu, suatu kali saya makan di sana bersama teman-teman. Banyak lalat di area prasmanan, padahal hotel ini terkenal dengan pelayanannya yang baik, tapi jadi buruk karena pelayannya kurang memperhatikan kebersihan. Kenapa hotel bintang 5 ini tidak memperhatikan detail pelayanan dan kebersihan, termasuk makanannya? Saya sangat kecewa dengan kejadian ini, semoga ke depannya pihak hotel bisa meningkatkan kualitas pelayanan dan kebersihannya."
"524.","MIYOUNG KIM","49","2025-01-21","1","1. Kondisi kamar sangat buruk. Pertama-tama, sangat kotor. Kamar baik-baik saja sampai saya check-in, karena mereka menawarkan upgrade. Itu sampai saya check-in ke tempat tinggal yang berdebu dan tampak terlantar. Saya hanya berencana menginap selama dua malam, tetapi akhirnya saya meninggalkan rombongan saya dan pulang setiap malam. Saya alergi debu. Sampai hari ini, tubuh saya masih gatal. Saya sangat malu dengan nama Marriott. 2. Staf di sini hanya menyembunyikan kesalahan mereka, dan hanya setelah saya menemukan bukti dan mengajukan keluhan barulah mereka dengan enggan mengakuinya. Saya memesan menginap dua malam dengan tarif khusus Club Marriott + voucher Club Marriott (diskon 25%). Namun, karena kesalahan karyawan hotel, dua voucher digunakan, dan saya masih belum menerimanya. Ketika saya pertama kali menanyakan situasi tersebut, mereka bersikeras bahwa saya hanya menggunakan satu voucher. Namun, setelah mengkonfirmasi dengan Club Marriott bahwa saya telah menggunakan kedua voucher di hotel Marriott, staf bersikeras bahwa kamar dengan tarif khusus Club Marriott sebenarnya adalah kupon diskon 25%. Bahkan ketika saya menunjukkan kepada mereka pesan-pesan yang telah saya tukar dengan Club Marriott, mereka tidak mau mengakuinya, jadi saya menelepon manajer untuk memverifikasi informasi tersebut dan mendapatkan kembali vouchernya. Masalah terbesar di sini adalah saya memesan menginap dua malam di Ritz-Carlton pada awal Juli selama perjalanan bisnis ke Jakarta menggunakan dua voucher diskon 25%. Namun, voucher tersebut tidak pernah dikembalikan, sehingga saya harus membayar satu malam yang lebih mahal daripada harga Marriott Bonvoy. Saya belum melakukan kesalahan apa pun sejauh ini, tetapi siapa yang akan memberi kompensasi kepada saya atas waktu, kerugian finansial, dan stres yang disebabkan oleh kesalahan memalukan Marriott? 3. Saya menggunakan layanan antar-jemput hotel untuk pertama kalinya, dan pengemudi yang dijadwalkan menjemput saya di Tunjungan Plaza pukul 21.00 tidak datang sampai pukul 21.30. Ketika saya kembali ke hotel, lobi sangat ramai karena ada acara. Saya akan mengerti jika mereka setidaknya menelepon untuk memberi tahu saya. Mengapa mereka meminta nomor kamar saya saat naik pesawat? Saya meninggalkan semua informasi kontak saya saat check-in, tetapi mereka bahkan tidak menelepon saya sekali pun, membuat saya menunggu shuttle di luar dalam cuaca yang sangat panas selama lebih dari 30 menit (saya sudah menunggu sejak sebelum jam 9 pagi). Ini adalah masalah layanan pelanggan yang serius. Melupakan tamu karena ada sekelompok tamu? Apakah ini yang terbaik yang bisa dilakukan Marriott? 4. Serbet yang membungkus peralatan makan di ruang sarapan terdapat saus di atasnya. Jika Anda akan melakukan hal ini dengan buruk, lupakan saja nama Marriott. Dua malam saya benar-benar tidak memuaskan. Oh, restoran Cina-nya enak, tetapi bukan milik hotel, jadi tidak ada yang perlu dipuji."
"525.","Geoffrey Simms","14","2025-01-21","1","Tempat tidurnya jelek, semuanya tua - sangat tua. Semua layanan makanan punya musik jelek yang diputar TERLALU keras. Saya minta roti panggang segar dari toko roti, dan yang mereka minta cuma roti basi. Saya benar-benar tidak tahu bagaimana orang bisa memuji hotel ini. Hotel ini jelas BUKAN kualitas Marriott."
"526.","rani rahma","2","2024-01-21","1","Pelayanan F&B yang buruk untuk ukuran hotel bintang 5. Kesan pertama hotel ini klasik & bagus. Semuanya baik-baik saja kecuali makanannya. Saya tidak menyangka ada lalat di makanan saya. Sepertinya ini di dalam ruangan, jadi lalat tidak mungkin berkeliaran kecuali makanannya tidak segar. Stafnya juga tidak peduli dengan hal ini. Ini disebut hotel bintang 5, tetapi saya tidak memperhatikan hal-hal seperti ini."
"527.","sb. uno02","1","2024-01-21","1","Kecewa dengan sistem pelayanan dan kebersihannya. JW Marriott termasuk salah satu hotel bintang 5 di Surabaya, tapi pelayanan yang diberikan kurang memuaskan, bahkan bisa dibilang seperti pelayanan hotel biasa. Saat makan siang di sana, pandangan saya langsung tertuju pada makanannya. Masak di hotel mewah ini. Kebersihan tempat makannya kurang diperhatikan, banyak lalat hinggap di makanan, bukan cuma satu piring, beberapa makanan yang disediakan juga dihinggapi lalat. Ini sama sekali tidak higienis, apalagi yang makan di sana adalah orang tua bahkan anak-anak. Apakah makanan yang disajikan kurang segar atau kebersihannya kurang diperhatikan sehingga dihinggapi lalat?"
"528.","Falla Gema","2","2024-01-21","1","Kecewa!!!! Hotel mewah dengan fasilitas lengkap tapi sangat kotor, banyak kecoa di toilet, banyak kecoa membuat saya tidak nyaman mengunjungi hotel ini lagi. Mohon jaga kebersihan, agar tidak ada hewan bau seperti kecoa di toilet hotel bintang 5 ini. Baru saja membuka pintu toilet, kecoa muncul di lantai, jadi saya menginjak kecoa, sepatu saya bau, padahal saya mau rapat. Saya beri 1 bintang untuk JW MARRIOT SURABAYA👎"
"529.","Alhussein Marzuk","21","2025-01-21","1","🙄 Punya Alkitab tapi nggak ada Al-Quran di kamar, padahal aku Muslim banget. Toiletnya juga nggak layak untuk wudu! Kayaknya hotel ini nggak menghormati mayoritas penduduk negara ini deh."
"530.","James Sumawi","2","2023-01-21","1","Tidak layak untuk sarapan di hotel ini, pelayanannya sangat buruk. Mereka menawarkan kopi, tetapi tidak akan pernah disajikan kecuali diminta lagi. Ketika harus membersihkan piring kosong, mereka sangat cepat, tetapi para tamu sudah selesai makan."
"531.","MARIA LELY","1","2024-01-21","1","Sebagai anggota bonvoy, saya berencana untuk check-in di Hotel JW Marriott Surabaya. Namun, pihak keamanan tidak mengizinkan kami masuk ke dalam hotel dari Lobi hanya karena jenis kendaraan tidak sesuai dengan SOP Hotel. Saya sangat mengerti bahwa mungkin itu bagian dari SOP hotel bintang 5. Oleh karena itu, kami mencoba masuk ke dalam hotel dari gerbang Loading Dock. Kemudian, pihak keamanan bertanya apa tujuan kami di sana, lalu kami menjawab bahwa kami ingin menginap di Hotel. Mereka tidak mempercayai kami hanya karena kendaraan yang kami gunakan adalah Box. Selain itu, pihak keamanan mendobrak gerbang ketika mobil kami hendak memasuki Gerbang Loading. Sungguh pengalaman yang disayangkan di sini. Tidak menyangka bahwa layanan di hotel bintang 5 seburuk ini. Saya berharap para petugas di sini dapat lebih sopan dan menghormati pelanggan tidak hanya berdasarkan jenis kendaraan."
"532.","Windy Windut","1","2024-01-21","1","Pelayanannya kurang memuaskan. JW Marriott, salah satu hotel besar di Surabaya, memang hotel bintang 5, tapi pelayanannya kurang memuaskan, bahkan bisa dibilang seperti hotel bintang 2. Karena kurang memperhatikan kebersihan makanan, lalat hinggap di makanan. Bukan hanya satu makanan, tapi beberapa makanan yang disediakan pun dihinggapi lalat. Sama sekali tidak higienis. Apakah makanannya sudah tidak segar atau sudah disimpan berminggu-minggu sehingga lalat bisa hinggap di atasnya?"
"533.","an jl","123","2023-01-21","1","Kami biasanya puas dengan Marriott Group. Namun, dengan JW Marriott Surabaya, kami kurang puas. Ketika kami tiba di sana, petugas keamanan, bell boy, dll., mereka semua sibuk mengobrol. Tidak ada yang membantu kami, dan mengeluarkan barang bawaan kami. Sampai akhirnya saya harus pergi ke mereka dan meminta bantuan. Kami memesan 2 kamar yang terhubung. Ketika kami masuk ke kamar, kedua kamar berbau sangat tidak sedap, mungkin karena karpetnya? Saya tidak tahu apa itu, tetapi ada bau yang aneh. Kepala pancurannya kotor. Dan kamarnya sangat gelap. Lampu baca di sisi tempat tidur semuanya rusak, tidak berfungsi sama sekali. Anak-anak saya mengatakan kamarnya sangat gelap, seperti di film horor. Saya menelepon petugas untuk bertanya apakah semua kamar memiliki bau yang aneh dan segelap ini. Ternyata ya. Mengenai baunya, mereka mengatakan mereka bisa menyemprot kamar. Tetapi kami semua sudah berada di kamar, dan hari sudah larut. Jadi saya menolak mereka untuk menyemprot kamar. Menginap di sana sungguh tidak nyaman."
"534.","Sumber Sejahtera","7","2024-01-21","1","Lobi penuh dengan orang merokok. Di mana lagi Anda bisa melihat ini? Saya menginap di suite yang wastafelnya tersumbat. Saya terlalu malas dan lelah untuk melapor dan memperbaikinya. Kamarnya juga sangat tua. Masih menggunakan mixer terpisah untuk air panas dan dingin. Saya akan menginap di tempat lain lain kali."
"535.","Fabio Talukder","41","2020-01-21","1","Celana boxer saya dicuri hari kedua dari kamar saya. Mereka tidak mengizinkan kami masuk ke restoran untuk sarapan hanya karena kami agak terlambat, padahal kami masih punya waktu 20 menit, tetapi mereka bilang akan tutup. Pelayanannya lebih buruk lagi. Pintu lift tertutup saat istri saya menginap, mereka tidak melayani servis atau renovasi. Jangan pernah ke sana. Mereka benar-benar memeras uang. Mereka hanya menginginkan uang Anda."
"536.","AB PS","28","2021-01-21","1","Kami pergi ke Imari untuk makan malam. Daging ikan sashimi-nya sudah tua. Potongannya tidak ramping dan gemuk sempurna. Guritanya sangat kenyal. Salmon panggangnya adalah steak yang sangat tua. Kami memesan 12 potongan sashimi yang berbeda dan pelayannya bilang terlalu banyak untuk beberapa potong, tetapi kami tahu selera makan kami dan kami tidak bisa menghabiskannya karena rasanya. Terima kasih atas pelayanan stafnya. Mereka luar biasa."

Jangan pernah mengambil makanan dari meja prasmanan...) Pengalaman yang sungguh luar biasa. Dibandingkan dengan datang ke makan malam kaiseki yang dipesan di Jepang hanya mengenakan jubah hotel dan sandal hotel (yang ternyata setara dengan acara jas hitam dan dasi di Jepang, ups 😶), atau masuk ke restoran fine dining di Italia mengenakan celana pendek dan sandal jepit (saat itu suhunya 4 derajat Celcius dan saya tidak tahu tuan rumah saya akan membawa saya ke restoran mewah, maaf 🙇‍♂️). Di mana kami tetap diperlakukan dengan sangat sopan dan anggun. (Membosankan sekali..) Bahkan dibandingkan dengan jaringan mereka sendiri. Marriott Yogyakarta, Ritz-Carlton Bali, St. Regis Bali. Yang ini cukup istimewa. Di zaman di mana Gordon Ramsey semakin sopan dari hari ke hari, tampaknya mereka memutuskan untuk meningkatkannya."

Bantal yang di kamar saya kurang nyaman sehingga kepala saya spt tenggelam. Paling mengecewakan adalah shuttle bus ke Sogo/TP yg saya pesan tidak datang. Sejak pandemi memang ada modifikasi. Awalnya shuttle bus selalu ready setiap jam. Saat pandemi, shuttle bus hanya by order saja via telpon dari kamar. Saya pesan dari jam 10 utk pengantaran jam 12. Tapi sampai jam 12.20 belum juga tiba. Staf yang berada di depan pun kurang bisa membantu. Saya cukup kecewa dengan itu. Jika memang tidak bisa, bilang saja. Saya bisa cari moda transportasi lain. Kalau begini saya jadi membuang waktu untuk menunggu. Kecewa."

Lalu mreka bilang harus menambah extra charge utk bf. Jelas sy tdk terima, krn di itenary hotel tertera free bf utk 2 pax. Jelas² mreka memanfaatkan org yg pertama kali stay disini. Tolong pihak hotel agar lebih memperhatikan ini. Petugas bf tahu sy baru pertama kesini, sebab waktu isi form bf sy tanya apa yg harus diisi di form kosong tsb. Tdk seperti hotel 🌟 5 lain, utk bf cukup ditanya dari kamar nomer brp."

Smoga saya tidak sakit perut. Kue langsung sy serahkan ke koki yg ada saat itu. Tindak lanjutnya sudah bagus. Sy didatangi pihak hotel meminta maaf dan diberi kartu nama. Namun tetap saja ini pengalaman saya yang sangat buruk dan tidak mengenakkan. Terutama hotel ini kan berbintang ya. Masak ada kecoaknya. Di makanan lagi.

"675.","Mike Dodge","119","2025-01-21","2","Bukan yang terburuk, tapi jelas tidak memenuhi standar normal hotel bermerek JW Marriott. Harganya cukup mahal untuk ukuran Indonesia, dan hotelnya cukup tua. Akibatnya, kamar-kamarnya tidak selalu berfungsi, berbau tidak sedap, dan sudah banyak mengalami kerusakan selama bertahun-tahun. Saya tidak bisa tidur karena AC-nya tidak berfungsi dan bau jamur di kamar. Sayangnya, pelayanannya juga cukup buruk, terutama staf bagian makanan dan minuman, yang membuat sarapan menjadi mimpi buruk... Bahkan untuk standar Indonesia, hotel ini kurang memuaskan. Jika Anda berstatus elite, lounge-nya sangat baik, begitu pula fasilitas seperti area kolam renang, sauna, jacuzzi, dll. Namun, jika Anda pernah menginap di properti JW lain di dunia dan mengharapkan hotel ini serupa, Anda mungkin akan kecewa. Ada hotel lain yang lebih baik di area ini yang harganya hanya setengah dari harga hotel ini, jadi saya sarankan untuk menghindarinya kecuali Anda perlu menginap sebentar di dekat Tunjungan dan tidak terlalu peduli dengan kualitas atau harga."

Kamar-kamarnya sangat kuno dan tua dengan bau apek, seprai dan gorden bernoda, bak mandinya juga terasa tua dan kotor. Saya sama sekali tidak mengerti rating tingginya, dan tidak akan pernah kembali."
"677.","Doee","18","2020-01-21","2","Pelayanannya luar biasa, stafnya sangat ramah dan membantu. Namun ada beberapa hal yang perlu Anda pertimbangkan jika hotel ini masuk dalam daftar pilihan Anda.

Kolam renangnya cukup bagus tetapi bak mandi yang kami gunakan airnya sudah teroksidasi sehingga kami tidak dapat menggunakannya sama sekali. Namun pelayanannya luar biasa dan restoran-restorannya secara umum bagus."

"680.","Andrian Hartanto","2","2023-01-21","2","Menginap yang Tidak Menyenangkan di JW Marriott Surabaya Saya menginap di Hotel JW Marriott Surabaya untuk staycation. Seingat saya, saya sudah menginap di hotel ini lebih dari 5 kali. Saya tiba sekitar pukul 23.00 malam, proses check-in cepat dan efisien (mungkin karena sudah larut malam). Setelah itu, saya berulang kali menerima fakta-fakta yang tidak menyenangkan tentang pengalaman menginap saya di JW Marriott Surabaya. Berikut akan saya jelaskan poin-poin tentang pengalaman tidak menyenangkan di JW Marriott Surabaya: 1. Saya memesan kamar Deluxe Premium King. Ketika saya memasuki kamar, saya tidak yakin apakah ukuran tempat tidurnya sama dengan yang diiklankan. Meskipun ukurannya besar, tempat tidurnya ternyata sangat nyaman! Poin nomor satu ini sebenarnya tidak terlalu mengganggu saya. 2. Keesokan paginya, saya turun ke bawah untuk sarapan dan langsung menuju Restoran Pavillion di lantai dasar untuk sarapan. Betapa terkejutnya saya ketika mengetahui bahwa area sarapan dipindahkan ke ballroom di lantai 2!!! Sungguh bencana yang mengerikan! Tempat ballroom-nya sangat tidak nyaman, seperti makan di food court, bukan di restoran. 3. Pelayanan sarapan sangat kacau dan buruk karena okupansi hotel tinggi selama masa liburan, dan pilihan makanan juga tidak sesuai dengan standar hotel bintang 5. Sebagian besar makanan yang disediakan adalah makanan Indonesia karena sepertinya hotel ini mengikuti tema perayaan Idul Fitri, tetapi hotel bintang 5 seperti JW Marriott seharusnya lebih dominan menyediakan menu makanan internasional! Telur tidak dimasak langsung di egg station melainkan dimasak di dapur (jadi telurnya tidak segar dan tidak bisa langsung diminta sesuai keinginan kita) sementara juga hanya ada 3 jenis buah di sarapan. Ini bukan sarapan prasmanan standar di hotel bintang 5! 4. Seperti yang sudah saya sebutkan, saya tiba di hotel hampir pukul 23.00 setelah perjalanan panjang, jadi setelah sarapan, saya berpikir untuk meminta late check out hingga pukul 13.00 agar bisa beristirahat lebih lama karena saya sangat lelah. Ketika saya di resepsionis dan menyampaikan permintaan saya kepada resepsionis wanita yang sedang bertugas di sana, resepsionis tersebut dengan sangat tidak sopan menunjukkan ekspresi tidak senang! Ini SANGAT TIDAK DAPAT DITERIMA! Jika ternyata okupansi Anda memang tinggi dan kemungkinan Anda tidak dapat mengakomodasi late check-out, pertanyaan saya adalah: Tidak bisakah Anda mengomunikasikan hal itu kepada saya dengan ramah? Jika Anda menjelaskan situasi Anda dengan ramah, tentu saja saya akan mengerti dan membatalkan permintaan saya, lalu akan check-out pukul 12 siang! Saya tidak bisa berkata-kata. Hotel ini sangat mengecewakan. Bagi Anda yang mencari hotel bintang 5 di Surabaya untuk menginap, saya sangat merekomendasikan Anda untuk menginap di Shangri-La Hotel Surabaya (dengan harga yang kurang lebih sama) yang memiliki pelayanan yang sangat memuaskan di semua aspek, atau mungkin di The Westin jika Anda bersedia mengeluarkan uang lebih. Saya menyatakan dukungan saya untuk JW Marriott Surabaya agar dapat ditingkatkan! Pihak hotel dapat menginvestigasi staf resepsionis yang tidak ramah dan mengembalikan sarapan prasmanan ke Pavillion Restaurant. Jika hotel memang harus menaikkan tarif menginap untuk meningkatkan layanan, hal itu juga dapat diterima, karena tentu saja, orang-orang yang menginap di JW Marriott bersedia membayar lebih untuk layanan yang luar biasa dan pengalaman yang menyenangkan. Saya rasa saya masih ingin memberikan kesempatan kedua untuk hotel ini, tetapi yang pasti, saya akan menghindari menginap di sini selama periode puncak karena hotel ini tampaknya kewalahan menangani banyaknya tamu."
"681.","Yuliana S","20","2019-01-21","2","Menginap di sana untuk sebuah acara. Kami tiba di lobi sebelum waktu yang dijadwalkan dan langsung memberi tahu penyelenggara acara, tetapi harus menunggu sekitar 1 jam untuk bus ke lokasi. Karena penerbangan kami pagi-pagi keesokan harinya, kami meminta untuk meninggalkan lokasi lebih awal dan mereka menjadikan kami tamu terakhir yang meninggalkan tempat. Tidak direkomendasikan karena mereka tidak menghargai waktu Anda."
