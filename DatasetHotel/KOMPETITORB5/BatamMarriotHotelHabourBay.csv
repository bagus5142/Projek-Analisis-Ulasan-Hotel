"1.","sarah yasmin","14","2025-12-18","5","My third visit to Marriott and I can confidently say that this is THE BEST hotel in Batam. Service is always exceptional, staffs are always so friendly and you can tell they take pride in their jobs. I had a one night staycation with family and eventho my birthday was last week, the sweetest front staff - Garcia arranged birthday decorations in my room, gave me complimentary breakfast for one more pax and i was spoilt with 2 cakes throughout my stay. I did not even expect anything from the hotel given that my birthday was long over but they go above and beyond to make me feel special. Truly made my weekend so amazing and I left back to Singapore feeling so sad. Breakfast spread tasted so good too.. im looking forward to my next stay here. ❤️❤️❤️"
"2.","Anisa Hamsani","42","2025-12-18","5","An Unforgettable Birthday Stay – Truly Exceptional Hospitality My husband and I had an absolutely wonderful stay at Batam Marriott Hotel Harbour Bay, and it was nothing short of memorable. The team went above and beyond by surprising me with a beautiful birthday cake and thoughtful birthday decorations in our room — a gesture that genuinely touched our hearts and made the celebration extra special. From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed with such warmth and sincerity. Every staff member we encountered was attentive, professional, and genuinely caring, making us feel truly valued throughout our stay. The hotel itself is stunning — a beautiful property with a relaxing atmosphere. Both the breakfast and dinner spreads were excellent, offering a wide variety of delicious options that were well-prepared and beautifully presented. What stood out the most was the heartfelt service. It wasn’t just luxury; it was hospitality with soul. My husband and I felt so welcomed, comfortable, and well taken care of, and this birthday stay will remain a cherished memory for us. A big thank you to the entire Batam Marriott Harbour Bay team for creating such a special experience. We will most definitely return and highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for exceptional service and a truly meaningful stay."

The location is really convenient after reading the reviews. Take a ferry and just walk to the hotel which reduce all the traveling and hassle. Batam Zoo Paradise, Grand Batam Mall and Nagoya Hill are just nearby as well as Wey Wey Seafood. (tip: you can request for a free ride to WeyWey from conceirge and anywhere around Harbour Bay area) The rooms and views are amazing. You can see MBS from M lounge and Altitude. My girl loves the hotel so much she wrote more than 3 notes for the housekeeping team. Once again, thank you Marriott team for making our stay enjoyable."
"4.","huda malik","8","2025-12-01","5","Five Stars for Marriott, and a Big STAR for Risya! I’d like to compliment Risya from the Front Desk for making our stay truly exceptional. From the moment we checked in, she was warm, approachable, and incredibly thoughtful. What she did for us went beyond amazing — thank you, Risya, for going the extra mile and making our stay so memorable. When I mentioned that my husband wasn’t feeling well, she responded with genuine compassion and care. Her empathy and willingness to help made a stressful moment so much easier for us, and we are truly grateful. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel is conveniently located, the room was comfortable, and overall we had a wonderful experience. But what will bring us back again and again is the outstanding service. We’re already planning our December holiday here. Thank you, Marriott, and thank you for having Risya as the face of your hotel. You’re very lucky to have her — she truly deserves a STAR!"
"5.","En Chong Lee","8","2025-11-01","4","I recently stayed at the Marriott Hotel right next to the Harbour Bay Ferry Terminal, and it was a fantastic experience from start to finish. The location couldn't be more convenient — just steps away from the terminal, making it a perfect spot for travelers coming in from Singapore or other nearby islands. The hotel is surrounded by a great selection of restaurants, offering everything from local Indonesian flavors to international cuisine. If you're looking to unwind, there are some excellent massage shops nearby — clean, professional, and incredibly relaxing. One of the highlights of my stay was the rooftop bar. The atmosphere was laid-back and stylish, and the panoramic sea view was simply breathtaking. From up there, you can enjoy a stunning view of both Indonesia and the Singapore skyline in the distance — especially beautiful during sunset. The staff were friendly, attentive, and always ready to help, making the whole experience even more enjoyable. Whether you're in town for a quick getaway or a longer stay, I highly recommend this Marriott for its location, amenities, and overall comfort."
"6.","A C","139","2025-10-01","5","One of the best hotels in Batam for sure! Walking distance directly to Harbour Bay Ferry Station and quite central to high end spots of Batam district. Shower is the most amazing in the rooms with high ceiling and high volume rain shower. Rooms are big, clean and personnel is awesome. Very friendly, interested and doing their best every second of the day. Breakfast options are almost unlimited, but mainly limited to Asian cuisine, definitely worth trying some food which you never tasted before. Overall top experience, i will definitely come again! Friska from the restaurant is doing an amazing job together with her colleagues! Edit after spending 5 nights: DONT stay in the rooms looking towards the square if you want proper sleeping in the mornings. The noise starts at 6AM as there is alot of construction and street noise."
"7.","Matthias Tan Yong Ming","9","2025-10-01","5","First time staying at this Marriott. Was celebrating my mom’s birthday and the team was so wonderful through and through. They truly turned this family trip into an unforgettable experience. Everyone we interacted with during the stay was so warm and professional, in a genuine way—not because there are service standards to abide to. We got a room with the harbour view. Clean, refined and really comfortable. Rooftop Attitude bar is a great way to see a sunset or get a nightcap. Breakfast has a good variety of ethnic foods. Definitely worth checking out - great for families and couples."
"8.","Alan Lim","1","2025-12-01","5","⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (6 out of 5 stars if I could!) Our recent 2D1N stay at Marriott Batam’s M Club was made truly exceptional thanks to Vanessa! From the moment we checked in, she went above and beyond in every possible way — always attentive, cheerful, and ready to assist us with any request. She helped us with extra items for our room without hesitation, gave us thoughtful recommendations on places to visit around Batam, and even made sure we enjoyed the food and services at the M Club Lounge to the fullest. Every interaction with her felt genuine and warm — it’s rare to meet someone so dedicated to making guests feel welcome and cared for. If I could rate Vanessa 6 stars out of 5, I absolutely would. She truly represents the best of Marriott hospitality. Thank you, Vanessa, for making our stay such a memorable and pleasant experience! 🌟"
"9.","Taiji Master","235","2025-10-01","4","Had a great stay at the Marriott Batam. The service was excellent — staff were warm, attentive and always ready to help. The location is very convenient, close to the ferry terminal and easy to get around. The room itself was spacious, clean and comfortable, with a modern feel that made the stay relaxing. The only downside was the room’s lighting and control buttons. They were not clearly labelled and were scattered in different spots, making it a little confusing to figure out which switch controlled what. It is a small detail, but it could definitely be improved for guest convenience. Breakfast was a pleasant surprise with a wide range of choices — both local and international options. The spread was generous, well presented and tasted quite good too. It made mornings easy and enjoyable without having to look for food elsewhere. Overall, a great hotel to stay in Batam for comfort, service and convenience. Just hope they could improve the lighting controls to make the room experience even better."
"10.","KM Lei","5","2025-10-01","5","Exceptional Service & Seamless Department Meeting Experience We stayed at the Batam Marriott Hotel Harbour Bay from 21–22 September 2025 for our department meeting, traveling in from Singapore. As frequent Marriott Bonvoy Platinum Elite and Titanium Elite members, our expectations are naturally high—and this property exceeded them in every way. As Head of Department, I reached out in advance to request a complimentary meeting room. Jennifer from the Marriott M Club responded with remarkable attentiveness and professionalism. She went the extra mile to ensure our request was met, and thanks to her, our meeting ran smoothly and successfully. Her dedication truly stood out—not just in her responsiveness, but in her genuine care for our experience. The entire M Club team was consistently helpful and welcoming, but Jennifer’s service was exceptional. She is a true asset to the Marriott brand. The hotel itself is ideally located right at the Harbour Bay ferry terminal, making arrival and departure effortless. Rooms were spacious, clean, and well-appointed—perfect for both rest and productivity. What truly made our stay memorable was the outstanding hospitality from the staff. Thank you to everyone at Batam Marriott for making our trip seamless and enjoyable. We look forward to returning."
"11.","Shyvonne Lee","307","2025-12-11","5","Beautiful place! We can see airplanes by the pool which my son truly enjoyed watching the planes. Lots of restaurants around the hotel too. Breakfast in the hotel was good too! Also, the healthiest indomie I've ever had 🤣"
"12.","Bherlz Ramos","5","2025-12-25","5","Truly a wonderful experience celebrating my birthday here at Marriott. The room was beautifully arranged, and all the staff were kind and very accommodating. I will surely come back to this hotel in Batam. Thank you to all Staff ❤️❤️ December 20, 2025"
"13.","Ella Kristia","4","2025-12-01","5","It’s one of the best five stars hotel we ever stayed. The staff was very friendly and the service was great. The room is very spacious and comfortable. The buffet was very good and had a wide variety of choices. Overall great experience and hope to come back again with family 🥰👍🏻👍🏻"
"14.","Amir F","75","2025-09-01","4","Had a great 3-night stay at the Marriott Hotel Batam! The breakfast was absolutely fantastic—so many options and everything was fresh and delicious. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, always greeting us with a smile and making us feel welcome. The location is also excellent, convenient and close to everything we needed. The price was not cheap, but affordable. Only reason I’m giving 4 out of 5 stars is because the room style felt a bit dated—a refresh would make this place perfect. Still, overall a very enjoyable stay and would definitely come back!"
"15.","Jo","453","2025-10-01","5","Great stay. The rooms were clean and comfy. Location was just a few steps away from the ferry terminal with a lot of food options nearby. The pool was great, reccomend to visit during sunset for the best views. The pool was well maintained, with a pool bar. Gym had good equipment too. Would love to revisit again."
"16.","scooter","41","2025-11-01","1","Giving one star for my stay. While most of the staff are pleasant and the hotel location is great, I was allocated a room on level 6 with heavy cigarette smell every day and night during my 3 day 2 night stay. I was traveling with my spouse and 1 young kid, and for Marriott to overlook the fact that there is a young kid in my booking, is totally unacceptable. The coway air purifier at the lift lobby ldidn't do it's magic unfortunately. The air was unpleasant at the lift lobby, corridor and sometimes my room. Of course, the bad air could enter the room even though I tried to close it asap."
"17.","Dean Stanton","860","2025-12-01","5","Truly outstanding. Maybe not quite the very best hotel in Batam but it's top three. Fabulous pool and bar but ridiculously expensive for Batam and Indonesia 🇮🇩 in general. However, the food is wonderful. Provided you're happy to pay very nearly Singapore 🇸🇬 prices 😂 🤣 💕. Certainly very easy to recommend. ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅."
"18.","Dini nurdiani","9","2025-09-01","5","My stay at Batam Marriott Hotel Harbour Bay was truly wonderful. The staff were warm, attentive, and always went the extra mile to make us feel comfortable. The room was clean, spacious, and had a beautiful view, making our stay very relaxing. I also appreciate the thoughtful touches prepared for my daughter’s birthday, which made the experience even more special. Thank you for the excellent service. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family."

"21.","neni racmacandrani","167","2025-11-01","5","Pengalaman yang sangat menyenangkan tinggal 3hr disana. Sangat ramah dan helpfull, pemandangan indah dekat dengan pelabuhan, jadi kalau mau ke SG tinggal nyebrang saja nunggu kapal di bawah. Kalau aku ke Batam lagi pasti akan milih hotel ini karena bener² kualitas makananya enak³ dan banyak banget."
"22.","Paul Denis","26","2025-11-01","5","Room with a nice view! Plus point is directly beside ferry terminal, has a nice tub for soaking and very pleasant service from the hotel staff who kindly assisted us by wheeling our baggages to the departure area!"
"23.","Liang Weirong","7","2025-12-01","5","Very helpful. Most of them are out to create an experience for you. I shared with them I don't know how to use the app to book a room with breakfast and they offered to teach me and gave me some pastries while teaching me. Also offered me a morning breakfast following day. Well done mariott Batam team"
"24.","Francis Kwang","106","2025-09-01","4","Location is great!! Right next to the ferry terminal and connected to a mall albeit a small one but there’s food, Starbucks, ATM, F&B and all the conveniences. The surrounding area is still underdevelopment but not too difficult to get a ride out to the more developed part. The ferry terminal has only 1 operator and therefore not too crowded. The hotel itself is standard Marriott. Rooms are decent sized though sound proofing could be improved. We stayed in the room facing the pier so we could hear the ferries coming in and out. And our room is on the 12th floor - just 1 floor from the roof top bar. And unfortunately for us, the neighbouring room has kids that were screaming at the top of their lungs! I’ve booked the rooms with M-Club Lounge Access but was told at the check in that I did not and it was upgraded because of my status. Not too happy about that. Furthermore, we were not given the option to check in at the lounge as we see others and in other hotels. The lounge staff when we visited were very helpful and friendly. However, there were several instances of very unruly young kids. I don’t think young kids should be allowed in the lounge. I would hope to revisit again when the surrounding is fully developed and hopefully the hotel maintains its facilities and rooms and customer service. However, I feel I have paid too much and did not get the experience I had expected of Marriott Hotel at that price."
"25.","Estella Koh","2","2025-07-01","5","On a little getaway from reality, Marriott Batam was the perfect place to rest and recuperate! Room was clean and spacious, and most importantly super comfortable to stay in! Breakfast buffet is prolly the most impressive one I've experienced and I'm someone who has been too many enough to know this is a super impressive buffet. I would like to give my compliment to staff Annisa who greeted at the entrance of the restaurant Goji where the breakfast was held. Friendly, super hospitalible and greeted with a warm professional way! She guided us to a wonderful table right by the window where we can watch the sea, ferries coming in and going out! Spread was super good! The ones that stood out to me was the Indomie station where superbly cooked Indomie (dry or soup) would prepared and served to your table once you ordered! Indomie served was delicious and definitely hits the spot!! The eggs station was far exceeds the ones in other hotels with more choices /ingredients for their omelette available for your eggs. Michael too was also super friendly and attentive to our table, constantly asking if we would like coffee and the coffee was SO good! Thank you so much for making our breakfast so wonderful! :) Michael, Annisa and other staff were super friendly and greeted guests with smiles and efficient, on point services. Please give them my heartfelt compliments! Thank you team!"
"26.","daddydrives","272","2025-09-01","5","Marriott Harbour Bay Batam is easily one of the best stays you can find in Batam. The location is unbeatable—just steps from the ferry terminal and surrounded by dining and shopping options. Our room offered stunning sea views that made waking up each morning a joy. Service was warm, efficient, and consistent throughout our stay. Whether you are here for a quick weekend escape or a longer holiday, this hotel ticks all the boxes for comfort, convenience, and a touch of luxury."
"27.","Germalaine Ngo","11","2025-12-01","5","Danu, Riska and Nesa😍 Look for them at Altitude, Batam Marriot! The best staff that will assist your requests. This Rooftop bar have a good view of the Batam City and the sea. A great place to chill and unwind."
"28.","Hwee San Ng","15","2025-09-01","5","I was literally blown away by how stylish deco and the welcoming staff. The breakfast was so good and there were so many food options. I like the idea of having the staff to bring the food that we have ordered. Thanks to Arema who is so kind to let us bring back coffee to our room."
"29.","Gabriel Ribeiro","8","2025-08-01","5","We ended up having to spend an unexpected night in Batam during our honeymoon because of a delayed flight, and honestly, what could’ve been a frustrating situation turned into one of the highlights of our trip thanks to the amazing team at this hotel. From the second we got out of the cab, the staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming. The doorman greeted us and was quick to offer to help with our bags. At check-in, they asked about our trip, and when we told them what happened, they went out of their way to make sure we felt comfortable and well taken care of. You could really tell they cared, which made all the difference. The hotel itself is super modern, stylish, and spotless. Everything from the lobby to our room felt fresh, clean, and thoughtfully designed. It honestly felt like a little slice of luxury that we weren’t expecting—but were so happy to find. Huge thanks to the entire team. Risya and Redor, you both really turned our night around and made it feel special. This is what great hospitality looks like, and it’s 100% in line with the high standards you’d expect from Marriott. We’ll definitely be telling everyone about this place, and would happily come back in the future."

"31.","Darcy Ahmed","13","2025-08-01","5","My family and I stayed at the Batam Marriot in June for over a week. It was an exceptional experience all around. The service from all team members was impeccable! The fantastic Goji Restaurant manager, Arema, always had a smile and kind words for us, brought us fresh juice and made sure everything was up to expectations. The breakfast buffet was huge, with many options (the local delicacies were our favorite), including gluten free bread and muffins, which I greatly appreciated! Thanks to Rachman for excellent service, as well as everyone else who took great care of us (whose names we did not get). Our room was clean, spacious, and comfortable, with a very nice view of the bay. The waterfall shower head was amazing, with plenty of hot water. We spent time near the pool and at the gym, which are both nice and surrounded by beautiful grounds. There was plenty of seating in the first floor lounge to visit with others, and the rooftop bar has amazing views! A very nice stay, we will return in the future if possible."

"37.","hatta muttaqin","21","2025-09-01","5","Marriott Batam is, in my view, not only the best hotel in Batam but also one of the finest I have stayed at in Indonesia. Everything is simply flawless. As a regular guest, several staff members already remember my name. Annisa, who is always in charge at breakfast, consistently offers exceptional service and warmly greets me by name — a gesture I truly appreciate. The rooms are excellent, the gym comes with a stunning sea view, and at breakfast, I especially enjoy their signature ‘kopi tarik.’ Without a doubt, this remains my go-to hotel whenever I’m in Batam"

"39.","Erika Chasya","62","2025-06-01","5","What I liked most about Batam Marriott Hotel was how helpful and friendly the staff were. They even assisted me in purchasing ferry tickets, which I really appreciated. The breakfast offered a wide variety of delicious options, and the lunch choices were just as good. The red bean ice cream was surprisingly tasty too. However, there was one downside — during check-in, our group of around 15 people experienced a long wait. The check-in process was very slow, possibly due to system issues or something else. It resulted in a lot of time spent just waiting. Hopefully, this can be improved in the future."

"43.","Shawn","19","2025-07-01","5","I had the pleasure of spending five wonderful days at Marriott Hotel Batam Harbour Bay, and the experience exceeded all expectations. From the moment I arrived, the staff were warm, friendly, and genuinely attentive, always making sure every need was met. What impressed me most was the thoughtful service. Even with the hotel running at high occupancy, they offered a complimentary upgrade to a spacious suite located on the same floor as the Club Lounge. This made everything more convenient and added a special touch to the stay. The front desk and bellboy team were polite and always ready to assist. They even helped to communicate with local Grab drivers, which made getting around much smoother. My room was spotless and well-maintained throughout the stay. Housekeeping was prompt each day and flexible with special requests for cleaning times or extra amenities, which I truly appreciated. The Club Lounge staff (Risya, Vanesa, Jeniffer) were especially attentive. They were always ready to help with any request, creating a welcoming and relaxing environment throughout my time there. Food at the hotel was consistently excellent. Breakfast each morning featured a wide and delicious spread, while the Taste of Ocean seafood promotion was a highlight, offering fresh and flavourful dishes that we thoroughly enjoyed. Located just next to the Harbour Bay Ferry Terminal (a 45 minute ferry from Singapore's Harbourfront Ferry Terminal), Marriott Hotel Batam Harbour Bay delivers a complete experience of comfort, quality, and genuine hospitality. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing getaway, and I look forward to returning soon."

"45.","Arokiasamy J","1","2025-08-01","5","Batam Marriott Hotel Harbour Bay is my favorite hotel whenever I visit the island. The location is perfect - conveniently close to shopping centres and restaurants, and just 15 minutes drive to Grand Mall. What makes it even better is that the hotel is directly connected to the ferry terminal and a shopping centre, making travel and leisure incredibly convenient. The facilities are top-notch, and the rooms are always clean and well maintained. A special shout out Ms Indri at the front desk for being so cheerful, friendly, and helpful -she really made check-in a breeze. I also want to commend the housekeeping team especially Sihol and Tautik,for their passion and dedication. Breakfast at Goji kitchen & Bar is another highlight. The layout and variety are excellent, and it's a great way to start the day.The new service staff Ms July at Goji Kitchen also deserve praise for her excellent service attitude- friendly, attentive, and professional.The Goji kitchen & Bar Team and throughout the hotel all staff are friendly, cheerful, and genuinely welcoming - they are the true jewels of the Batam Marriott Hotel Harbour Bay. Thank you for the excellent service. Keep up the great work!"
"46.","Eric Lim","22","2025-07-01","4","Went to the roof top bar for the sunset view. Food and drinks were quite nice. The sunset view is priceless. Remember to request for sunset view facing Singapore. Reach there between 5-6pm local time. Tips from not only one staff from the hotel even though I was not staying there. :)"
"47.","Ana M","87","2025-06-01","5","Go to place in Batam for some pampering and comfortable stay. Walking distance from the ferry . Excellent hospitality shown by the staffs. Shout out to Indiri at reception , Jennifer at the M club and Randy the manager . Everyone had a ready smile and the service was very good. The suite had a fantastic view . Food was also delicious . Bed and Pillows were comfy with all the basic amenities you would expect from a 5 star hotel. Will definitely stay here again if ever I come back to Batam."

All the staff are courteous and very helpful in everything, from the day we checked-in up to check-out 🥰. The food and rooms are good too. 👍 Thank you for always bringing our ordered food in our room 😁🥰. Staff's hospitality is great from the concierge, lobby, security, dining and cleaners 👍.

"50.","SL Ang","149","2025-07-01","5","I had a very comfortable 2 nights stay here. All the staffs were very polite (greeted me whenever I walk past) and helpful (always offered to help may it be holding on the lift for me or carrying my baggages). The hotel is very clean and quiet. However, 2 staffs have gone beyond the extra mile. Cha Cha- offered and made me ginger tea as I was unwell and coughing my lungs out. Arema- came over multiple times and asked me if I need any help or further request, then help by fulfilling my request I was very satisfied and happy with the service provided by all the staff. I would say this is the best service that I have experienced among other Marriott hotels (all over the world). Would like to thank all the staffs- definitely a Memorable stay for me Next, the food. There are two restaurants, Goji (serves local and western food) and Jiang He (serves chinese cuisine). I managed to try both and would say Jiang He serves very very good chinese food. The steam fish was very very fresh. Fried rice was perfect too. The sea view from my room is very beautiful as well as I overlook the other end of batam. One thing to note- I can see rubbish floating on the sea. I hope that the management could initiate some cleaning event to spread awareness among the people."
"51.","Romario Kusno","70","2025-05-01","5","My stay at Batam Marriott Hotel Harbour Bay was nothing short of exceptional. From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with warm hospitality. The rooms are modern, spacious, and beautifully designed, offering stunning views of the harbor. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and every detail from the lighting to the bathroom amenities felt luxurious and thoughtfully curated. One of the highlights was the big infinity pool, which overlooks the sea. It’s the perfect spot to unwind, especially during sunset. The fitness center is also well-equipped for those wanting to maintain their routine while traveling. Its location near Harbour Bay Ferry Terminal makes it super convenient and it is ferry hub so I can go to Singapore easily. Whether you’re traveling for business or leisure, Batam Marriott delivers a perfect blend of luxury and comfort. I’ll definitely be coming back."
"52.","Ti Liang","27","2025-06-01","5","Nice hotel at a great location, within walking distance to Harbour Bay terminal and others restaurants/shops nearby. The view is fantastic from the room and the M Club. Variety choices of food & drinks during breakfast buffet, and really like the live cooking station of eggs and noodles. The staffs are friendly, hospitality and always have smile on their face, especially Jennifer and Nella at M Club, both are helpful and approachable. The margarita make by Jennifer is really good. Looking forward to back to this hotel in future."

Special thanks to staff Annisa, who notified us of fresh fruit juice available today and offered it to us (and remembered how many people were sitting at our table). Thanks Annisa and Marriott! Edit (30 Jun 2025): I would like to commend another staff who worked the evening shift at the Lounge in the lobby who made my drink and went the extra mile to help set up 2 extension sockets just so I can charge my laptop and work at the Lounge! The Lounge was pretty empty at that area so it wasn't disturbing anyone so I really appreciate his helpfulness and initiative! His name is Ably/Adly I believe, sorry I didn't catch his name but your kindness has left a mark, and made my Marriott experience better, thank you!"

"56.","Dian Roseli","10","2025-05-01","5","I really enjoyed my stay and can't wait to come back again. All the staff are welcoming and attentive. From the front desk to the concierge, room service, housekeeping, breakfast buffet, and the waiter from the rooftop bar. The breakfast is at Goji Restaurant, which is also the kitchen for the room service, and it is halal, although they do serve alcohol. It's the same for the rooftop bar. I also enjoyed the spa at level 5 by Eska group. The staff is always attentive and always checks that you are comfortable. It's slightly more expensive, but the service and facilities match the price. Ika gave alot of advices to my mom who liked jamu lol. Special mention for Mezz @ Concierge. He really assisted us a lot and is always checking if there is anything else that he could help us with. Thank you!"
"57.","tasha malek","36","2025-08-01","5","We had a fantastic stay at Marriott Harbour Bay Batam, made truly special by the incredible staff. Rena was warm and professional at check-in, giving us all the info we needed and surprise my daughter with owlie toy! Galih went above and beyond — from arranging a shuttle to Bay City Seafood to personally walking us into the restaurant and helping with our daily activities. His service was exceptional! A heartfelt thanks also to Hoblet Rio, our room attendant, who surprised us with a beautiful anniversary decoration in our room. It was such a thoughtful gesture and made our celebration unforgettable. Additionally, they also have kids activities during weekend that include Beverage Class Bartender for Junior. Bintang and Andika very cheerful and good entertain the kids. Thank you to the team for making our stay so memorable. Highly recommended!"

"60.","derek neo","1240","2025-05-01","5","My stay at Batam Marriott Hotel Harbour Bay was truly pleasant. The staff exceeded expectations with their exceptional friendliness and politeness, setting a high standard. The hotel's location is incredibly convenient, situated right beside the Harbour Bay ferry terminal. The rooms were clean and comfortable. What truly made my experience stand out was the attentive service, particularly from the club staff who kindly offered to collect my ferry boarding pass. A wonderful touch that showcased their dedication to guest satisfaction."
"61.","Chanantorn T (Pear)","10","2025-06-01","5","My stay was almost perfect!(unpleasant story at the end) Most of the staff are nice and friendly, room were sparking clean with a great view. I arrive a bit early and they still manage to prepare the room before I reach. (Thank you!) Even surprise me with some dessert in the afternoon and offer second round of room make up. Their facilities are great, I personally love thier gym and the rooftop bar(breath taking view). Breakfast meets Mariott standard, lots of options and yummy! Only unpleasant experience happended when I was going for my breakfast. I head there after my gym and still wearing my gym outfit (Sport bra+ covering shirt and the legging). The lady and the registration was occupied with other guest, who I assume to be a business man base on his attire, while she accompany other guest to find seat I stood there, waiting for my turn. After a while another staff approach and ask for my room number and tell me to go get seat myself instead of accompany me like any other guest. I have no issue getting my own seat but I felt 2 standards of services was made obvious here. Was I being treated differently because I was still wearing my gym cloth and not business attire? I stayed at Marriott often enough for both business and holiday and this is the first time I experienced this. Other that this, everything was great. Might still comeback."

Will be back for sure for our next vacay!"
"66.","Mat Dodol","685","2025-03-01","5","Lovely hotel, beautifully designed. Staff adorable. A couple of small gripes. Coffee was powdered sachets x 2. Hotels of a lower calibre that I've stayed in recently have been equipped with coffee pods/coffee machines. Also, it's great to have the USB slot next to the bed....but only 1?! Older hotels I've stayed in recently have had at least 3. But I'd come back!"
"67.","Siti Aisyah","5","2025-01-01","5","I had an enjoyable 3d2n stay here. Not only that the hotel is right beside the ferry terminal, there are plenty of amenities around and it is very convenient to get around. I had a minor inconvenience with the initial room they provided but the service recovery of the staffs was close to, if not perfect! Breakfast buffet was really good too as they had a lot of variety and food was constantly getting topped up all the time. I managed to drop by the rooftop bar for a drink and I have to say that I really like the ambience of it! Overall, I will be back and highly recommend this hotel if you’re looking for a hotel with amazing service and amenities."
"68.","Erica tay","25","2025-04-01","4","This is my 4th time staying at Batam Marriott Hotel Harbour Bay, and I’m honestly very disappointed this time. Every visit, I specifically request a Level 5 pool-facing room so I can relax on the balcony while watching my kids in the pool. In the past, this request was never an issue. However, this time the staff gave me a room that didn’t face the pool, and I couldn’t watch over my kids unless I brought them along, which defeats the purpose of booking that specific room. I was told they would arrange a room change the next day at 3 PM, but they only called me at 5 PM — by then, we were heading out for dinner, so it was too late. I also requested a late check-out at 3 PM since my ferry was at 5 PM, but they only offered 1 PM, saying someone else was checking in the current room that I’m staying. If that’s the case, how was my early booking not prioritized? What frustrated me the most was how they kept emphasizing that I booked through a third party. Even before I arrived, I called the hotel at 1 PM to confirm my request, and the staff immediately brought up that it was because I booked through a third party. Then, when I arrived at the hotel and went to the counter, the staff again mentioned the same thing. What exactly is the issue with booking through a third party? I still paid for my stay like any other guest. From 2025 onwards, it seems that if you book through a third party, your requests will simply be ignored or rejected. This was never an issue in 2023 and 2024, as my requests were always accommodated. Even the staff at the front desk made it unclear whether they purposely ignored my request because I booked through a third party, or if it was for some other reason. But at least now, I can clearly see how they handle requests based on how a booking is made. Now, even Marriott members don’t get dining discounts anymore. When I asked about it, the staff mentioned that the discount is now given as points instead. But what confused me was that the staff didn’t even ask for my membership number—probably because I booked through a third party again. If Marriott is changing its policies, they should at least be transparent about it instead of making customers figure it out on their own. That being said, I do appreciate that the staff and cleaners at Marriott Harbour Bay were very friendly. Thank you to them for their hard work. However, the overall experience was frustrating, and Marriott’s service policies seem to be getting worse. Marriott used to prioritize loyal customers, but now it feels like they don’t care as much. This experience has made me rethink my loyalty to the brand."
"69.","Toh Felicia","34","2025-04-01","4","Room's spacious and clean, but I was woken up a few times by the noise outside. Had to put on my ear phone to sleep. Impeccable service from the staff everywhere in the hotel, whether at the front desk, restaurant, or at the pool. There could be a few more varieties of food within the section for breakfast buffet. The hotel is further away from the city so will need to travel to get to the major shopping malls."
"70.","Aaqs Dabest","11","2025-01-01","5","Rooms: they were spacious, had aesthetic glass bottles that are better for the environment compared to regular plastic bottles. Beds were very comfortable. Although there was some blood stain on my blanket, they changed it almost immediately and rectified the situation. Service : On their rectification of the stain on my bed, they arrived promptly after my call to the front desk. The friendly worker who assisted me was very polite, and even apologised for it verbally many times. To my utter shock, today, after my second day in this hotel, they wrote an apology letter and placed it on a table in my room, with a slice of cake neatly presented in a box. I was pleasantly surprised as I didn't expect them to go out of their way to do this. The guy/ girl at the front desk who answered my calls was very professional and polite. Location: Very conveniently located directly beside the harbour. Saved so much time and hence I didn't have to stress to plan what time I had to leave my hotel to reach the harbour. Great view overlooking the sea and the harbour."

"76.","Wee Leong Tay","32","2025-05-01","1","Formal complaint about Batam Marriott Harbour Bay I would like to bring a few points into concern. First of all, when I arrived at Marriott at 9.30 I was told to await for available room, and thus I had wanted to have some juice and pain Au chocolat at the illy cafe next to counter. Not only did they forget both of these orders, I had to stand up and walk over 2 times to ask for each (because they forgot both). I only have had 2 hours sleep at that point, it was frustrating to see others have their food and drinks while we waited for 30mins without anything. When I gotten into my room, I must admit that the room looks good and I need to rest after. I was awaken up by screaming kids by the pool who were so rowdy (with music playing) that it woke me up from my sleep. It’s been very upsetting as it went on for more than 1 hour. Even after I called the concerige they said they will ask the people to quiet down but I’m not even sure if they did anything as the noise kept going on. The concerige said, “the pool is close at 8pm as well.” But I felt it was not very appropriate to advise your guest to just live with the noise until 8pm as we are paying customers too. They did help changed our room after eventually, but while it was quieter, the room we got was smaller overall. I don’t really felt it was fair overall even thought we paid more for balcony but it didn’t felt like we had any choice on the matter. During breakfast, drink order was requested (ice black and ice early grey milk tea) but did not arrive. We waited for 30mins and we went up to check again, only to realise they forgotten the order. The table beside us seemed to be receiving much better service, being guided to table and asked for drink order while we were ignored. Overall, this has made my experience in Marriott was not too positive for a place I’ve paid over sgd 600+ on. We were so fed up that we did not even take photos of the room."
"77.","ThianYong Chan","919","2025-03-01","4","The room is spacious and clean, providing a comfortable stay. The hotel’s location is a major plus—it’s right next to the pier, so you can conveniently walk from the ferry terminal. The dining options are impressive. The breakfast spread offers a lot of variety, and the Indomie (instant noodles) is a must-try. The coffee tarik is also very nice. The Chinese restaurant serves delicious food, with fresh fish that stands out. Instead of dining at the seafood restaurants outside, having dinner here is a great alternative. However, one persistent issue is the towel supply. For some reason, towels are often not replenished properly after cleaning. The drinks in the fridge are complimentary, but only for the first day. I would suggest the hotel replenish them daily, as the cost isn’t high. Even better, making coffee tarik or teh tarik a daily free drink would be a great touch! Overall, a pleasant stay with good food and a convenient location, but a few small improvements could make it even better."
"78.","deska sim","3","2025-04-01","4","This is our second time coming for their Iftar buffet, main courses were all great though the Thai dishes were limited, considering they are promoting Thai cuisine chef from Marriot Bangkok, we thought there will be more selections. Their cakes need some improvement though, it’s slightly on the dry and lack of moisture. We were also excited to try the kopyor ice cream, but unfortunately, it had an unusual aftertaste that we couldn't quite place. Lastly, great staff as usual! Keep it up!"

"91.","Aaron Tan","9","2025-01-01","4","It is true, this hotel is one of the newest and luxurious in Batam. Location wise, it is conveniently located above harbour bay ferry terminal. There are eateries, seafood restaurants and convenience stores around the vicinity of the hotel. Hotel reception was kind enough to upgrade our connecting rooms to sea facing without extra charge. The sea view is real plus if you are staying for the first time and adds to the whole stay experience. The rooms were much more spacious and well-furnished than I thought and already, I had a couple of friends asking me about the hotel after I posted on my socials. The staff was generally welcoming and carried a smile when conversing. Breakfast experience was enjoyable too as the open kitchen was spacious and food stations were nicely spaced out. We would very much like to stay there again but were told we weren't going to enjoy the complimentary upgrades anymore so we would need to weigh up the next stay based on the prices we are quoted next time. Thank you Batam Marriott."

Staff were friendly, helpful and attentive! The only “complaint” was the spa, it was managed by 3rd party. I was charged 10% + 35% tax and the staff couldn’t explain exactly what tax was that. Highly recommended!"
"117.","Jeremy Choo","66","2024-01-01","5","Hotel is located right beside Harbour Bay Terminal with various different F&B options and amenities such as Guardian and ESKA massage and Spa. Rooms were immaculate and every single staff there were all polite and very service-oriented. They do their best to accomodate all the needs that you have. For the 2 nights, I stayed there with my family, their hospitality was nothing short of amazing. You have hotpot, Korean BBQ and other seafood restaurant within a 5 minute walk from the hotel. The pricing may be a expensive for some but it is definitely worth at least a try. You will definitely not regret this. I have no pictures here because what you see online and other reviewers is exactly what you get."

Just note that you will hear the ferry noises during the morning-afternoon in case you want to sleep. Huge selection of foods for breakfast and lounge, but prefer better taste than wider variety. Ultimately staff are generally helpful and friendly. Would be my choice of hotel should I ever return to Batam again."

Great location especially if you come here via ferry as the hotel is just next to the ferry terminal. Many nice restaurants nearby. The sea can smell bad in some evening so it’s not the best when your at the pool beside that I highly recommend this hotel if your in Batam."
"122.","Yudha WP","50","2024-01-01","5","Stayed there for 5 days on the business trip. The best hotel in Batam so far, breakfast was amazing but lunch and dinner was so so. The room was OK but it would be better if they provided a bathtub for a standard room like other 5 star hotels. Early check in was negotiable so long as the room is available. That was perfect. The gym was clean, neat and amazing. Toiletries was amazing. Overall 95/100."
"123.","Jayden Lee","19","2025-01-01","5","Even though I wasn't a guest at Marriott, Manager Reza and his team went above and beyond to accommodate to my request. I was able to get what I urgently needed late at night that wasn't offered at nearby convenience stores. Kudos to Mr Reza and his team for their excellent service. I did not expect them to accommodate to my request and was pleasantly surprised they did. Will definitely consider future stays at this hotel. Thank you once again!"

"127.","Wee Nee L","32","2023-01-01","4","The location is great as it is right beside the ferry terminal, and there are restaurants within walking distance all around the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, but the only small issue was that you could hear the ferry in the morning. The staff were all very helpful and welcoming. The roof top bar also had a nice ambience, and the drinks were great as well."

It’s super convenient too, right at the doorstep of Harbour bay pier! Famous seafood Wey Wey and local hair and massage places are close by . Highly recommend this hotel!"
"129.","Ika Puspitasari","280","2025-01-01","4","Hotel bintang 5, 12 lantai dgn rooftop yang terletak di harbour bay, akses lgsg utk naik ferry ke Singapore. 2 hari kegiatan di ballroom lantai 3, jd ga sempat akses pool, gym, rooftop dll. Ballroom nya besar dan ada view menghadap ke laut nya, mudah dijangkau dengan akses lift maupun eskalator. Note saya utk hotel ini: 1. Hospitality staf nya sangat kurang mnrt saya. Dr awal satpam di lobby, receptionists, resto staff dll minim greeting, krg peka, krg senyum, krg helpful, gesture tubuh nya tidak customer friendly (dari cara melihat, meletakkan pesanan, dll), bener2 perlu ditingkatkan hospitality nya, krn skedar pilihan hotel bagus dan bintang 5 banyak, tp selaku penyedia jasa, customer experince dr sisi hospitality sgt penting utk diperhatikan 2. Hotel dgn rate diatas 3jt per malam, tapi - tidak ada bathtub di bathroom nya - menggunakan air minum isi ulang (refil) yg di kamar - menu breakfasnya relatif tidak banyak pilihan utk standar hotel bintang 5, dan taste nya relatif biasa."
"130.","New Regina","38","2024-01-01","5","I had a great night stay at the hotel. Room had impeccable view of the Harbour and is liked directly to the ferry terminal. Good choice of restaurants along the harbour if you want to explore the area. Felt very safe in that area and the restaurants mostly had live band too. The hotel breakfast at goji was great too and service top notch. This might just be the best hotel in Batam, worth the price"
"131.","H Yeuming","32","2025-03-01","2","the rooftop bar intend to overcharge, telling is system fault, not recommended, dishonest Response to Manager Manoj Rawat:- We ordered 2x cocktails and 1glass with 2shots of remy martin, when come to the bill, spotted the remy martin was double charged, not matching the menu Your staff told that this is next month price and due to system error. (receipt attached) Is it true that this is next month price for single shot of remy martin is IDR 316? it changed in middle of the month?"
"132.","Richard Navarro","1002","2024-01-01","5","Had an absolutely amazing stay here at the Marriott Batam. Even though it opened back in October 2020, it feels like it has only been operating for a couple of months with the whole of the facilities being in impeccable shape. The staff definitely take care of the facility and every bit of the hotel. Check-in process was very smooth especially if you’re arriving at the Harbour Bay Ferry Terminal. After exiting immigration and exiting the ferry station, you will find yourself literally steps away from the entrance of the Marriott Hotel, which is convenient (and quite a relief) especially for those that may be coming from the airport to the ferry to the hotel or are looking to relax as soon as possible. We were warmly greeted by the check-in staff at the second level. And after they checked their system, they recognized my status and had me check-in at the M Lounge on the 11th floor. I was greeted by Rena who completed the check-in process for us. She gave us all the details of the facility and walked us through the lounge and was such a pleasant joy and made our stay very enjoyable. If you have an opportunity to access the M Lounge, it is well staffed and a very comfortable place to have a coffee, grab a snack, enjoy local cuisine, and have fun unique drinks made by the staff themselves. I had an extra day of work on the first day there and it was a great place to work at, since the staff were accommodating, offered tea and coffee, and even offered the meeting room for me to take some personal calls. The gym was just the right size, and has most general equipment that should satisfy most people. It has a great view of the hotel pool and the waters. The low tide in the morning isn’t the best view but by the afternoon the view gets great with the rising tide. They have a pool bar and the pool is nice and long so you can get a couple of laps in to get your heart pumping or just enjoy some time to yourself in the pool. The water is at a good temperature where it’s still refreshing to get in but not too cold where it’s uncomfortable. They do have a kids pool which is shallow but something that the kids can enjoy. The spa was also very nice, they have a very wide menu, and the schedule availability was very good when I visited, they were usually ready within the hour and were always available when scheduled in advance. Yes, it is a bit more expensive than options outside the hotel, but the quality and convenience is what you are paying a bit more on, so for me it was a win. The rooftop bar is also very nice and well designed. I did not get the chance to enjoy a drink at the time, but definitely a great place with a great view and friendly staff that greeted me. Will be taking advantage of this place next time around. The daily breakfast is also very much worth it so add it to your stay if you are able to. They have one of the best hotel breakfasts I’ve had the pleasure of enjoying. It served the typical fair that you would expect from a hotel, with minor rotations to ensure you dont’ get bored of the food, but at the same time get to enjoy some of your favorites again. I particularly enjoyed their drink cart which had numerous types of ginger drinks, from ginger and honey, ginger and turmeric, and more! They even had a kopi stand as well! Aside from the drinks they can cut fresh local fruit for you. I got to enjoy plenty of mangosteen (manggis) which were very much in season! They had a custom noodle station and an omelet station with local specials such as the seafood omelet which was unique and so good for what I was looking for! And on our last day the staff surprised us with a nice corner table well decorated with rose petals. It was incredible. They even made us some custom drinks which were very tasty it was some sort of guava, strawberry, with soda. It was so good! Everyone was amazing at this hotel. I already am looking forward to my already booked stay a few weeks from now to experience it all over again! Thank you again to Rena, Vivi, Sandi, Mez, Vinsen, Jennifer and the many staff at Batam Marriott!"

Staffs very polite and helpful. I asked if there was discount for Marriot Bonvoy member. They checked and revert there was discount. What I did not expect, the crew surprised us with birthday songs and a well crafted birthday cake! Want to thank the whole crew who made my day. I can only remember a staff named Raka. He cleared my plate before replacing with the birthday cake. Very considerate, and well trained in hospitality. Thanks once again!"

"135.","Taqin J","139","2024-01-01","5","I recently had the pleasure of staying at Batam Marriott Harbour Bay and I must say it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the wonderful staff, particularly Rena, for providing a smooth check-in process and making me feel welcomed right from the beginning. The warmth and friendliness of the entire team were truly commendable. One of the highlights of my stay was the amazing breakfast spread. It's safe to say that it was the best breakfast I have had in Batam. The variety of dishes, including a delightful selection of local specialties, was truly impressive. The flavors were authentic and delicious, allowing me to savor the local cuisine and start my day off on a high note. The location of the hotel was incredibly convenient, situated right next to the harbor and surrounded by a multitude of eateries. It made exploring the local dining scene a breeze. Furthermore, the breathtaking view of the sea added an extra touch of beauty to my stay. It was a pleasure to wake up to such a stunning vista each morning. In conclusion, my stay at Batam Marriott Harbour Bay was nothing short of fantastic. The combination of excellent service, particularly of the friendly and helpful staff made me feel like a valued guest. The amazing breakfast spread, with its wide array of dishes, surpassed my expectations, and the convenient location next to the harbor and eateries made my stay even more enjoyable. Moving around Batam is easy with Grab. The mesmerizing sea view was the cherry on top of a truly wonderful experience. I highly recommend Batam Marriott Harbour Bay to anyone seeking a warm and memorable stay in Batam. Thank you once again to the entire team for creating such a delightful and welcoming atmosphere. I look forward to visiting again in the future."

"138.","P S","15","2024-01-01","5","This hotel plus the people are awesome! Very accommodating and they have commendable attitude towards guests. You'll never feel different treatment from them for all guests. Salsa from the concierge and the rest of them there, up to the barista, Dino, they were all wonderful people. A good hotel will never be good without good service. And those staff we've encountered have done incredible job. Even those staff from the breakfast restaurant, they even surprised my son with birthday cake and they sang (the resto staff) for him that made my kiddo's birthday extra special. 🙌🏻👏🏻 My husband and 2 kids would like to come back but for a longer period next time. Hotel is really adjacent to harbourfront centre. And Gojek transport option make things easier for us."
"139.","Stanly Widjaja","19","2023-01-01","4","Spent two nights here during my last visit to Batam. No complaints on the room, services and location, everything's just perfect. Room was spacious, clean and neat, filled with everything you need and more than enough bottled water, I even got a welcoming snack / chocolate although I didn't taste it. Services also very nice as all the hotel staff I met are friendly and helpful. Location is near city center and walking to distance to various restaurants. However I found it a bit off in the breakfast department, as there are really not so many options to choose from and it was below my expectations from a Marriott Hotel. Had a buffet lunch also during the stay and all I felt that is was not like a 5 star hotel lunch experience."
"140.","Chris","537","2025-01-01","4","Located just above the Harbour Bay ferry terminal, you can say it’s a good location or not so good if you wish to be near city centre. So location is very subjective. The hotel cost $300+ a night, without much facilities, just a small gym, a spa and a normal size infinity pool. The pool has a small jacuzzi area but the air pressure for jacuzzi is very weak. So in terms of price vs hotel facilities, I will give it just a 3-star (unlikely stay again). Next to the hotel is an open area where they have pasar malam, which can be quite noisy. The room is nice with good toiletries and they provide a few free drinks. Overall, I give it a 4-star, consider it pricy based on the available facilities. I hope the hotel can consider more indoor facilities, such as indoor steam room, sauna, jacuzzi."
"141.","its POTATOGIRL","58","2023-01-01","5","The place is very clean, there is also air conditioning throughout the whole hotel which makes it cold so I suggest a jacket is in need. The breakfast is the best part of the hotel, there are many different foods from different places such as western and Chinese, the staff is also very nice. There is a pool and a gym in the hotel the pool has a great view and I suggest taking pictures there. There is also a spa but I didn't check it out.The room is neat and it also has a great view. Nearby there is a shopping mall and the custom so if you are going there for a vacation from a different country such as Singapore it is great as you don't have to take a taxi to go here. Although it is pretty costly."
"142.","Vijay Raj Kumar","75","2023-01-01","5","I’ve just checked out of the hotel and writing this review for anyone looking at a convenient and relaxed holiday - do consider Marriott at Harbourbay! Absolutely delightful stay and much-needed break for us. The hotel staff went the extra mile in their hospitality, greeting services and everything else. We booked via the Marriott website and before our arrival, every time we had some queries the hotel staff was very pleasant, prompt and welcoming to help. Reaching the hotel from Singapore HarbourFront terminal is such a breeze! Horizon ferry brings you right upto the hotel front! So convenient! Our check-in was super smooth, and very fast. Though our room wasn’t ready at arrival (we came in much before the check in time of 3pm - can check prior if they can accommodate early check-in), we went exploring the nearby area - lots of eateries and hanging out options within walking distance of 1km or less. We were allocated a room on the tenth floor and what a view! The bed was comfortable, and the bathtub was extremely relaxing for me. The breakfast service is extensive, lots of Asian options and their signature omelette is a must-have. Even the bakery items and the local delights are very good. Special mention the nasi goreng - It was my repeat order over 2.5 days of stay! Loved it! Ask for the seafood catch of the day - we had Norwegian salmon, and it was just perfectly made and flavoured. No fuss about it. I also really enjoyed the gym - super view and though we didn’t use the pool this time, we will return for it. It’s on the same level as the gym and oversees the water - wow again! Also check out altitude bar at the rooftop for stunning views! Special mention to the housekeeping staff for prepping our room with such a thoughtful gesture as we were celebrating our anniversary weekend! Thank you so much! We really appreciate the lengths you take to make our stay comfortable and memorable and upkeep of our room!"

He definitely made our day from arranging the special deco in the room for hubby's birthday to sending the special cocktail to our room. He also made an arrangement for us to have breakfast at Goji and the FnB team surprised my hubby a birthday cake too. We enjoyed and had great experiences at the club lounge too.

"147.","V L","27","2025-01-01","5","After staying here in Batam for 5 days and touring the various tourist places in Batam, Marriot Harbour City is the place to stay for a blissful and enjoyable getaway. Pak Christy GM, Monica Director of Ops, run a very tight ship. They are very guest-centric and responsive to tge needs of all guests. All the staff we interacted with from the breakfast kitchen to the housekeeping and reception, were super-friendly and looked happy to be working here. We stayed at a 1 bedrm suite connected to another room. Rooms looked brand new, overlooks the tranquil waters and smelt of the familiar Marriot fragrance. The gym was well maintained and clean with a lot of nice equipment. Again great to be running on the threadmill facing the blue waters. Breakfast buffet offered a huge selection for everyone and every race. There was a fruit bar, a Jap section, an Indian Section, various inonesian stations from nasi lemak to bakso etc. The egg station will fix any kind of eggs to our hearts content. There was even a porridge station plus a teh tarik stand. Amazing bfast. Room service was also prompt and delicious. Besides, harbour city had many nice restaurants around. The hotppt restaurant 100m from the hotel was just amazing even by Hadilao standards. There was also a daily pasar malam food mkt each evening a stone's throw away for that nostalgic kampong feel. So in conclusion after seeing all the other good hotels in Batam in Nagoya Hills or Batam Mall or Megamall etc, the Marriot is still hands down the place to be. We looked fwd to coming home each evening."
"148.","Nurdi Rayah","11","2025-01-01","5","Just came back from Batam. Stayed here. Just wow!! First I have to say I dressed very very simply just t shirt and uniqlo lounge pants. I did not carry any designer but the reception I received was so fantastic. I was standing outside the lobby and the staff actually went out and greeted me and asked me about my day. She asked me where I would be staying and she would help get transportation. She maybe tasked to enquire but she did not do it in a disapproving and condescending way. Her smile was warm and friendly. When I told her I would be staying there she actually called another guy to escort us to reception. I told them I was going shopping first since check in was at 3pm. He told us we could leave our luggages. The entire staff was really sincere and warm. I requested a room with seaview and it was really a beautiful scenery during high tide. The room was luxurious, dreamy beddings. It was unfortunate that it drizzled that night so.I could not sit in the open air roof top bar. Otherwise the rooftop bar was also wonderful. The breakfast was awesome!!! When I checked out a male staff actually pushed our luggages all the way to the ferry terminal. Its a bonvoy so definitely price wise is similar to spore but I will definitely stay here again."

After dinner, we went to the Altitude bar at the top for a drink and my wife asked for cake which they duly obliged with a slice of nicely presented apple pie, complimentary. When we went back to our room, we were surprised to see another small cake for my birthday, again with nice presentation and a birthday note! On the whole, I enjoyed the personalised and attentive service and will return. Many thanks to the team at Marriott who made our stay memorable!"

The room was clean, spacious and comfortable. The food served during the corporate event was simply delicious! For breakfast on the day we arrived in Batam... Had some apple crumble, a fruit tart and a chicken bun with hoisin sauce. Loved the apple crumble the most as it was dense and packed with flavour! The remaining photos are an assortment of food I had for the company dinner and dance! Loved the rendang the most - soft and tender! Shoutout to the orange crepe as well - the crepe was really soft and had a good balance of sweet and citrusy flavours. The toppings were self-serve, so I took some nuts to add a crunchy texture to the crepe! Thoroughly enjoyed the food! A huge shoutout to the hotel for making the event a success!"
"154.","MF MS","911","2024-01-01","5","Highly recommended for business traveler who can afford the luxury and the comfort of a 5-star.

The area is built up with the business travelers in mind, including having a taste of local lifestyle at the comfort of a mall and a beachfront."

Staffs are very helpful and welcoming upon my arrival. Welcome drinks are served. I got lucky for a free upgrade room with sea view. Please keep it up! Room is very neat and clean. Bed is huge and very comfortable. All amenities you need are available - comb, body lotion, mouth wash, nail file, dental kit, shaving kit, sewing kit, hair tie, vanity kit, shower cap and sanitary bag. Plenty of water provided (4 bottles). Showering area and toilet bowl is separated. Showering water is also clean (no smell). Infinity pool is awesome with the view. Location is very accessible. Harbour Bay Ferry Terminal is right below the hotel. There are a lot of food to eat nearby too. Travelling out to Nagoya Hill Mall and Batam City Square Mall is convenient. The only downside is that the aircon feels like it is not turned on which makes the room feel stuffy but it is still cooling. Television channels are very limited - there isn't much shows to watch :( . Room feels dark at night even with all the lights turned on (makes it difficult for me to do my work). Will definitely come back when I wish to plan a short staycation at Batam!"
"157.","Shirley","56","2024-01-01","5","If this hotel could get 10 stars I will give it 10 stars. Hands down one of the best hotels in Batam! Service is amazing and they rectify any complaints or any small minor inconvenience immediately. No hesitation no further questions. Just settle whatever complaints you have. Rooms are big and clean and overall so comfortable. Pool, rooftop bar, gym all first rate and well maintained. Goji kitchen has one of the the most amazing breakfasts! Just pay for the breakfast together with your room. Totally worth it. Don't even need lunch. Only thing you need to remember is the tap water is NOT PORTABLE. Cannot even boil the tap water to cook anything. Never used their spa coz much cheaper spa is everywhere in Batam. Location is super convenient. Just turn left and walk straight from ferry exit and the hotel is there. Definitely will stay again and again"

The hotel itself offers a respite for the Singapore-wearied Singaporeans and a totally new world from the hustles and bustles of old Nongsa or Nagoya wild wild west frontier town experience. Yes, five star it is. Absolutely. No crowded streets and urban slums to traverse. Built EXACTLY besides the ferry point and an adjoining mall. The planners got it all right. But it was the personable and indefatigable staff that were the stars. Everyone smiles and serves with unbridled Javanese warmth. Yes, everyone, everywhere and every day."
"160.","Sandy Tok","18","2024-01-01","2","Our Check-in at JW Marriot took more than 10mins. With 2 staff at concierge but attending to others when we were asked to wait without further explanation. Could have handled it better. Unpleasant experience from the start as there wasn't any bell boy at the hotel entrance to welcome, in fact throughout our entire stay there too. He appeared from the lobby after we had unloaded our luggages from the car. My room didn't have any table or chair. Got to take a set from the balcony into the room for checking emails on laptop, and other purposes like makeup and meals. My room's curtain couldn't close properly, leaving a 6 to 7 inch gap. Every morning was awoken by the early sunrise at 6am. Didn't expect this from a 5 stars hotel. On 2 of my morning sleep, my family and I were also disturbed by prayers and songs from a mosque nearby at 4plus am which was really loud on the first night. My youngest son was asking them to stop in his sleep! Had asked for sea view but was given a garden view which was made up with a room change quite promptly. However, a key card was working after the change and another key card that expired in 24hrs when we were staying for 3 nights. 1 of the light in the room wasn't working, making the dimly lighted room darker. 1 of the light in the gym female toilet wasn't working too when I tried to makeup there. Went to the gym to make up instead! On 2nd night of my stay, a staff pressed the doorbell at about 9am to enquire if room service was required when makeup room button is available at the doorstep. We have yet to ask for it as we were still sleeping. He made up for it by apologising. On the 3rd night of our stay, which is a X'mas Day, we received a call at 6.20am but the call was dropped as I was still drowsy from my sleep. Received another call at 6.45am to say about my family was not having breakfast or breakfast department said to call about breakfast. The best part is I couldn't understand what she wanted at all. My entire family was still sleeping from the late night dinner and party on X'mas' Eve. Finally, she got it that I was pissed by the early phone call. She ended the call by saying Thank You instead of Sorry!!!! Speechless for a moment. My sleep was disturbed and I was upset thereafter that I couldn't sleep anymore. I had stayed in many 3 to 4 stars hotel in other developing countries with better service level, and definitely could speak better English! I really didn't expect all these from JW Marriot. The service standards and the hotel's amenities really blown me out of my mind. Didn't expect it to be so bad regardless of location. To conclude, 1 night stay is worth if you are seeking a really nice view for a pretty high price per night. Otherwise, nothing is worth 5 stars here."
"161.","Felipe Pineda","8","2024-01-01","5","The Batam Marriott Hotel Harbour Bay is a modern and luxurious hotel located in the heart of Batam, Indonesia. The hotel's location is ideal, situated just a short distance from the ferry terminal and within easy reach of the city's top attractions. Upon arrival, I was impressed by the hotel's contemporary design and elegant decor. The lobby area was spacious and welcoming, with friendly and attentive staff ready to assist with any requests. The rooms at the Batam Marriott Hotel Harbour Bay were spacious, comfortable, and well-appointed, with modern amenities such as flat-screen TVs, air conditioning, and free Wi-Fi. The room I stayed in had a large comfortable bed and a beautiful view of the sea, which was a great spot to relax and take in the view. The hotel also boasts a range of facilities, including a fitness center, a swimming pool, and a spa, which I thoroughly enjoyed during my stay. The pool area was particularly impressive, offering a relaxing environment to soak up the Indonesian sun. The food options at the Batam Marriott Hotel Harbour Bay were also excellent, with a range of restaurants and bars to choose from. The breakfast buffet was varied and tasty, with a selection of hot and cold dishes to suit all tastes. The hotel's Indonesian restaurant, Wan Li, also provided an excellent dining experience with delicious local cuisine. Overall, I would highly recommend the Batam Marriott Hotel Harbour Bay for anyone visiting Batam. The hotel's location, facilities, and attentive staff make for an enjoyable and memorable stay."

"164.","Travel Writer","129","2023-01-01","4","Located just at/next to Harbour Bay, upon disembarking from the ferry, you are literally a stone's throw away. Hotel is located within the harbour bayfront area and connected to a modest mall with food court, kfc, Starbucks. We came at a rather off-peak timing. Service is attentive and staff do try to help when possible. However, rooms can be better maintained considering this hotel is rather young. The water for bath tub is not hot enough and bathroom can be better ventilated. Pluses Most Rooms offer good view Hotel offers infinity pool Nice clubroom with a good view but do note like some hotel club rules, kids below 18 not allowed in."

Saya menginap di kamar Deluxe King selama 2 malam. Suasana kamar yang nyaman dan tenang membuat betah tidur nyenyak. Tertidur di sofa pun sangat nyenyak. Goji restaurant menyajikan breakfast yang enak, bergizi, dan pilihan menu sangat lengkap. Memberikan energi yang positif untuk petualangan di Kota Batam. Kawasan Harbour Bay juga turut memberi nilai plus, nyaman untuk jogging di pagi hari, mudah mencari makan malam dan oleh-oleh. Altitude Rooftop memberikan pengalaman yang berkesan. Walaupun kami hanya pesan kopi dan teh Dilmah, staffnya tetap ramah, bahkan membantu kami berfoto. Dan bisa melihat Singapura tentunya, wabil khusus MBS."

"169.","Johnathan Leow","7","2024-01-01","5","Marriott Batam is a destination in itself (Batam doesn't have much to do anyway besides eating shopping and massage).i have been a Bonvoy elite member for years,and one of the key things i look for in an excellent hotel is whether every staff greets you,and also the attention to detail. I was really really impressed by the friendliness and service mindedness of every single staff who stopped and greeted us,even right down to the technician! A special shoutout too to the front desk manager Tintin, who really displayed exemplary service recovery after an episode on the first night(they reassigned us to the suite!). She made sure to personally find us and apologise while we were having breakfast at Goji,and even invited us to the iftar evening buffet; the breakfast and dinner buffet is AMAZING!(its the only Marriott i've stayed that has a very wide food variety and very well prepared). The level 5 pool facing suite room too in particular,we absolutely loved the spacious layout,many recliner chairs and very comfy bed. The level 11 lounge too has a great view of the sea and has outdoor seating. Also the hotel is conveniently located just 2mins walk from the harborfront ferry terminal and is just a 10min drive to nearby shopping malls,so it takes the stress out of having to plan to depart early to catch the ferry (we left hotel only 15mins prior to departure). All in all, i would say its the most value for money Marriott stay i've ever had. For SGD $250 a night,you'll be hard pressed to even find any hotel in Singapore that comes close to the excellent level of service and amenities that Marriott Batam Harborbay has to offer. 10/10 would definitely return again!"
"170.","Rachel ___","45","2024-01-01","5","I have visited Batam quite a number of times, and I have to say that Batam Marriott Hotel is the best I have stayed so far! The service provided was excellent! Everyone, from the reception counter, to the elevator attendant, concierge, door greeter, housekeeping team were so polite and helpful! Better than 6 stars hotel in Singapore or Europe! Special thanks to Mr Rahmat Yusri (Guest Experience Specialist) - he made my stay with my family such a wonderful and memorable one. Everything was well-taken care of, and he made great efforts to ensure we enjoyed our stay. Also, a big thank you to Mr Mez, Mr Faridz and Mr Dedy. They were all so kind and helpful, and the service provided is impeccable. Just a few comments on where I hope there could be improvements: 1) The pillows are too soft and basically flat the moment u lay ur head down. Wish they could provide fatter pillows for better comfort ;) 2) The lingering odour around Batam is something only the Government can do. It's such a pity, as the coastal view from Marriott Batam Hotel is nice, but one has to tolerate the mild bad smell from the rubbish and pollution around the island. It's worse when you go to the nearby seafood restaurants."

The standards shown in terms of customer care, quality staff and overall stay should make Marriott proud. Special mention to Rishya, Aldi, Vanessa and Salsa for that extra touch! Connecting (very clean and comfortable) rooms were thankfully available, with lovely seaview. Comes with international power plugs and the full works of a 5* hotel. Location is great overall, just the lack of any mall nearby makes that 1* difference in terms of convenience."

"177.","Yong Shearn Chia","102","2023-01-01","4","This gonna be the longest review that I going to write till date. Let’s talk about the pros and cons of my 3 days 2 night stay in this hotel. Pros - location is excellent. Just book your ferry to harbour bay. Once you exit the immigration, turn left is the hotel. - staff is extremely friendly. All the staff will greet the guest whenever they see the guest. - place is clean and view is nice as I opt for the ocean view room. View of the ocean is good. - hotel is near to a whole stretch of food and drinks places. You can get seafood and nasi Padang etc just within 2 mins walk. - buffet breakfast came with wide spread. Cons - check in time. I arrived early at like 9am. But I didn’t expect to check in at that hour so I inform the staff that I will be back at 3pm for check in. When I’m back at 3.15pm, I was told the room is still not ready for check in as the housekeeping still need some time and I waited for another 15 mins before the room is ready. - housekeeping need some improvement. After the additional waiting time, I went Into the room and everything looks fine. But when I went to the toilet, I realise the floor towel there are only one and the shower and bath tub is separated. So I should put the floor towel outside shower or bath tub? The floor tend to be slippery. - amenities. The shower area comes with shower gel, shampoo and conditioner. However, the conditioner is empty and the housekeeping didn’t realise and didn’t top up. - no bathroom slipper. The room doesn’t have a bathroom slipper and I need to request one for them to send up. But the bathroom slipper seems to be very low in quality. Doesn’t seems to be something I get from a supposed 5 star hotel though. - sound proofing is quite bad. So I was staying on the 10th floor and 3 floors up is the roof top bar. I can hear the music quite clearly and affecting my sleep as the music only stop ard 11 to 12 midnight. I can also hear the prayers at 4am which affects my sleep. I understand that if the ferry is right below and the horn could be quite loud. But the sound proofing should be better in blocking out the bar music and prayer sound? Overall I would say it still a good hotel to stay due to the location."

"179.","Prasanna Vee","988","2024-01-01","5","Harborfront Luxury I am not exaggerating when I say that We visited Batam not to explore the destination or do any sightseeing, but purely to spend a lovely day and night at this beautiful property by the harbor. I am glad we chose to do this hotel-based trip! Every moment from the minute we stepped out of the harbor and entered this property to the minute we stepped out was magical. The place feels like a Sanctuary. And thanks to the warm hospitality we were showered with throughout our stay we felt like we were residing in a palatial abode and so never even bothered to step out of the hotel to explore anything in the city! LOCATION: This hotel is located within the same complex as Harbor Bay. So it's just a couple of minutes walk away from the ferry terminal DINE + DRINK: Multiple fine F & B establishments on site. The Chinese Restaurant and the Rooftop lounge are fabulous places that you must check out during your stay. ROOM: We stayed in Room 815, which was a sea view Suite, so this review is based on that; VIEW: Marvellous views of the Sea and the pretty village nestled next to the shore; SIZE: Spacious enough with a huge living area and the big Bedroom; AIR-CON: Perfectly functioning cooler that helped in setting the perfect room temperature; BED: Comfortable bed that played the expected part of putting me to sleep; BATHROOM: Huge swanky bathroom with a lovely Stand-in shower; TOILETRIES: Spa quality cosmetics by THISWORKS brand FACILITIES: Fully loaded Gym with a good range of weights and Cardio machines. Lovely outdoor Swimming pool with lovely sea views. There is also a wonderful Spa on site SERVICE: Friendly staff that took care of all our needs with a smile and made us feel pampered and well taken care of. Special Shout out to the GM who enhanced our stay! Everyone we interacted with during our stay - from SADDAM at the Club lounge to all the staff at the bar and restaurant overwhelmed us with the finest hospitality HOW WIRED YOU WILL BE: Free high-speed Wi-Fi that works well all over the property. Huge Plasma TV screen dishing out a wide variety of channels spanning sports, news, music, movies, and entertainment in multiple languages - one each in the living are and the bedroom"

"182.","Melvin Lin","298","2023-01-01","2","I ought to say we went over the long weekend, when they were supposed to be more busy and therefore maybe ought to cut them some slack. That said, the entire stay was just a series of disappointments and frustrations, and our Marriott stay turned out to be the worst part of our entire trip. When booking, and again a couple of days before check-in, I requested connecting rooms because I was travelling with 2 young children and a senior, and needed to take care of them. My requests were acknowledged. We arrived at about 10:45am, and there were no connecting rooms available. I said I could wait until dinner time, when hopefully some guests have checked out, availing of connecting rooms. The staff member said that could help, and she would try to get us the rooms then. However, when we got back to the hotel after 8pm and asked for our connecting rooms, we were told that there was no such request logged. We were given rooms on the same level to make it easy for me to care for my family. They were on separate ends of the corridor! In the room, we also realised that cleanliness wasn't great. The kids asked why the pillows were so stinky. We asked housekeeping for body lotion, and were told that the hotel had run out of those. Sound-proofing wasn't great either. We were kept awake by loud music from outside until late. We also knew a few neighbours had the habit of returning to their rooms past midnight, and even where exactly they were partying. At breakfast, half the food offerings were out at any point of time, and the coffee machine was down most of the time. Orders were repeatedly forgotten, and nobody came to remove plates. We were told that they did not have children's cutlery in this hotel - never heard such a thing anywhere else in the world. Spa session for the wife and mother - booked it for 4.30pm, but at 4.15pm , we received a call asking if we could postpone to 5pm instead. We informed the caller that we had a dinner reservation, and had to stick with the timing. She agreed. In the end, the wife and mother were kept waiting for 45 minutes. The wife told them that we would miss our dinner appointment, and had to cancel the session. The staff members insisted if they were to cancel the session, we would still have to pay the full price as a cancellation penalty, even though it was the staff's fault for being 45 minutes late! So we ended up with a spa session that was 45 minutes late, a missed dinner reservation, a couple of kids who were hungry and cranky and had to be distracted with snacks while waiting, resulting in more frustrations at dinner because they no longer had an appetite and were just too drowsy because it was almost bedtime. Elite members were offered cocktail vouchers at the rooftop bar. While the disastrous spa session was taking place, I brought the kids to the bar to utilise the vouchers. Unfortunately children were not allowed at the rooftop bar. I was then advised to go to the lobby lounge instead, where I was assured they would also honour the vouchers. At the lobby lounge, I was told the vouchers were only valid at the rooftop bar. I told them I was turned away and referred to the lobby lounge, the gentleman at the lobby lounge insisted he would not accept the vouchers. He then told me I could leave my 7yo and 4yo alone in the room, and go by myself to the rooftop bar to sip cocktails. The last morning, brought the kids to the pool, and they had run out of towels. I had to grab a small towels from the gym. There was also mold/algae at the children's pool entrance, which got several kids (including mine) landing on their butts. At 10am I also requested for a late check-out because my ferry was only leaving at 2:30pm. I was told I could stay in one of our rooms until 1.30pm. At 12:30pm however, we received a call to the room asking us why we had not vacated that room. At this price point, I know of many other Marriott properties in Bali and other parts of ASEAN which can offer much better value."

I find all the staff from the Concierge, front office check in staff to the restaurant were all very professional , welcoming and very very helpful. Just to name a few, Mr Rahmat from the front office was very accommodating to our need to check in early and request of a better room. He and his colleagues from room services surprised us further with a beautiful welcoming message nicely written and decorated on the bathroom mirror and towel like swan deco on the bed. Today we received an email from the lost and found informing of an item found in our room which we actually left behind on purpose. Well done Marriot HarbourBay! See you guys soon!"
"200.","Flo Yeow","5408","2024-01-01","5","They're definitely one of the more expensive hotel options here in Batam (relative to the resorts and cheaper hotels). But depending on what you're looking for, I feel like Marriott Batam is worth the price. Most importantly, it's convenient and feels absolutely safe. It's a short 5mins walk from the ferry arrivals and departures, and the walkway is connected to Bayfront Mall. Service is great, definitely Indo hospitality. Many a time, they were able to fulfill our many questions and requests for them, and provide us ideal comfort as their guests. Food options are also vast, with the Boat equivalent just within walking distance of the hotel, in the direction of Harbour Bay Seafood restaurant (there's a few others in that direction). If not, the hotel's dining options are more than sufficient. Altitude bar, Goji Kitchen and Bar, The Lounge, Jiang He Chinese cuisine. Can't complain really. Of course, if I were to nitpick, given that I benchmark them to St Regis KL, the premium luxury vibes across the entire experience is not quite there yet; but it's forgiveable given that this is Indonesia and not Malaysia, and that's afterall a St Regis."

"202.","Shubham Shrivastava","239","2024-01-01","5","Best place to stay in Batam. Comes with a heavy price tag for staying in Batam but worth every penny. Staff is amazingly polite and caring. Rooms are nice and cozy and there are tons of places around to keep you intrested throughout your visit."
"203.","Yi Chien","5","2024-01-01","5","It's really convenient as it's just right next to the ferry terminal. The service was immaculate, staff were very helpful. Only one thing was it wasn't a smart TV. But they offered to provide hdml cable. If I visit batam again, Marriott will definitely be my 1st choice"
"204.","Riang R","67","2024-01-01","5","Location is just beside harbour bay ferry terminal. On the weekends there is night market in front of hotel. Staff of hotel always greet us with a smile. Quick and efficient service. Love the breakfast spread."
"205.","Qi Wang","1","2023-01-01","5","The best hotel in Batam. I've stayed for almost 4 weeks and loved it. Fancy breakfast with lots of varieties. And the M lounge on 11th floor has the most diligent staffs with wonderful communication skills. 5 star hotel with 6 star service!"
"206.","Jason Dawson","17","2023-01-01","3","The service wasn't what I expected from this Hotel. They brought out the meals at different times, so we had to wait an unacceptable time, just to eat together. We had to ask for things like napkins, and water. We asked for extra bread. The gave one slice. Then when it came to the dessert menu, everything we asked for, they didn't have. Not the service that I have come to enjoy and expect from this company."
"207.","Kai Lee Chen","6","2024-01-01","2","Defintely OVERPRICED!. Soft pillows which are bad for our neck. Wide spread of buffet at breakfast but NO cooking standard and poor quality of foods. Stayed there to attend a wedding event at the Ballroom and it turned out to be a NIGHTMARE. The prawns were NOT FRESH, The fish was DRY/BLAND and the chef simply pour curry sauce over it! The dessert, Yam with coconut was SOUR/SPOILT. Many guests suffered diarrhoea thereafter. A table of 8 guests but only 7 portions of foods were being served. Despite telling the waiter/waitress repeatedly, the 'shortage' portion of food was not served. This is the worst wedding event I have attended"
"208.","Jonathan Lai","65","2023-01-01","2","It is ok, that is what the 2 star means. Good, it is located just beside the ferry terminal, and there are spa and food choices within walking distance. Room is big and seems clean. But during our Oct stay, we keep hearing loud music from somewhere... somwhat. Could be from the nearby eateries. Then to top it off , there could be pests running along the airocn ducts at night, making audible be noises. And maybe because of this, the aircon thermostat is not working at all. Set at a comfortable 25c, but the room will be at 15c when we return at night. So, what does it mean, good if you plan to party, bad if you need a tranquil environment. Your choice."
"209.","Ai Fun Tan","23","2024-01-01","5","Excellent location which link to Harbor Bay Ferry Terminal.

"216.","Dani Moore","66","2023-01-01","1","We ate their restaurant last night. By far one of the very worst restaurants I have eaten in, the food was very old, and terribly cooked. Wine was not drinkable. Service also shocking. Do not waste your money nor your time. We had a simple pasta dish, a local chicken dish and a starter, we ate nothing. Wine took nearly 30 mins to arrive and food was an hour, left hungry overcharged and seriously disappointed."

"222.","subandono rachmadi","562","2023-01-01","5","Hotel yang satu ini terlalu sulit untuk dicari kelemahannya, dekorasi ruangan, fasilitas menginap atau berkegiatan, hidangan yang tersedia, pelayanan staff, ataupun lokasi hotel rasa rasanya semua memiliki standar yang lebih dari hotel pada umumnya. Lokasi di Harbour Bay sebagai salah satu lokasi terbaik di Kota Batam dengan pemandangan langsung laut yang sejurus mata memandang akan tampak negara singa diseberang lautan. Lokasi hotel ini juga merupakan salah satu tempat berkumpul nya warga Batam yang memiliki hobi olahraga jogging dan bersepeda santai, sehingga tamu hotel pun dengan nyaman menggunakan area ini untuk berolahraga pagi ataupun sore. Harga standar hotel kelas ini tentu menjamin para tamunya menikmati kenyamanan pelayanan yang akan mereka rasakan selama menginap di hotel ini dari mulai kenyamanan ruangan tidur, nikmatnya sarapan pagi dengan berbagai menu nasional maupun luar negeri juga kemudahan reservasi dan cekout serta layanan para staff di hotel ini."

Recommended if when traveling to Batam island from Singapore via 35 minutes ferry ride."

"233.","Destiana Pramasari","106","2022-01-01","5","Hotel bintang 5 di Kota Batam, but honestly beda kayak hotel bintang 5 kebanyakan. Breakfast, snack, makan siang B aja, fasilitas jg biasa aja. Nginep 2 malem, peralatan mandi nggk ditambah, padahal sabun cuma dikasih sebotol kecil, jd hrs minta dulu. Menang di viewnya sih, karena langsung menghadap ke laut dan pelabuhan harbour bay untuk penyebrangan ke Singapore, jadi enak ngelihat kapal2 yg berjajar dan berlayar. Oh iya ada deposit kamar 500rb/malam dan hanya bisa cash dan credit card."
"234.","Wendy Sim","125","2024-01-01","5","Located just right outside Harborbay ferry terminal, the location is the best! Service was impeccable and the rooms are new and in tip top condition! Stayed in the room facing the sea and it was just awesome!"

"243.","John L","5","2023-01-01","1","I’m an Elite Bonvoy member and had stayed for a number of weeks at Marriott, Batam, the stay was a very nice personal experience compared to other Hotels in Batam however, I rank it 1* as they charge extortionate prices for wine at the Altitude bar, 237,000 for a glass of very average wine, minimum SGD5 more expensive than a good restaurant in Singapore, the measure was also questionable. The hotel is definitely of a comfortable standard but Marriot needs to remember, it’s still Batam. I provided feedback to the sales and marketing manager but have yet to receive any response, hence why I’m posting this review….."

Traffic-nya biasanya berangkat pagi bisa pulang sore, pengunjungnya relatif banyak. Penyebrangan ini merupakan penyerangan yang aktif ke Karimun maupun ke Singapura. Kapal penyebrangan ke Singapura kapalnya lebih besar dibandingkan ke Karimun. Adanya penyebrangan ini memudahkan penginap di Marriot atau Swiss-bel Hotel, karena cukup dg jalan kaki bisa ke dermaga ini. Akses antara dermaga dan hotel ada mall dg beberapa tenant top seperti starbuck dan guardian"
