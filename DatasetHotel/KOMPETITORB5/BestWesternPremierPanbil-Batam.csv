"1.","Nooris Sng","5","2025-12-25","5","Most wonderful about our stay has been the welcoming, friendly and service-oriented staff. They were on hand to address our queries, our requests and even went out of their way to make sure that our family of 7 had a great breakfast experience on the last day of our stay. Of particular mention is the breakfast staff, Juang (hope the spelling of his name is correct) who made special arrangements to cater to our big family. It was a crowded morning and he still made sure that our needs were taken care of. The icing on the cake was a special dessert that was sent to our table. So pretty and delightful! The friendly staff who greeted us in the morning when we left for our shopping trips and in the evenings when we returned, were exceptionally welcoming and warm. Overall, we love the stay here and appreciate the warmth and hospitality of the staff very, very much. Thank you! ❤️"

The staff’s hospitality and professionalism really stand out. Literally, everyone was warm, attentive, and always ready to help. Their spoken English is excellent, which reflects the quality of the team and the level of training they receive. It makes communication smooth and pleasant throughout the stay. Special shout-out to Chef Ahmad Fauzan, and staff members Nabila and Rida for going the extra mile with every request. Their dedication and friendliness made my experience even more memorable. Highly recommended for anyone looking for comfort, quality service, and a welcoming environment in Batam!"

Security adalah salahsatu frontliner terpenting yang bisa memberikan kesan baik di awal saat menerima dan mengarahkan kendaraan tamu. But, over all is good I'll be ready to comeback again, someday. Many thanks."

The breakfast buffet was marvellous, From local indon food to Western. Juice drink u can DIY with fresh juices. Jamu drinks too available. I love it so much!!! Thank youuuuuu so much."
"5.","Y W (Carry Crystal Maiden)","104","2025-12-01","4","Quite good hotel near housing complex. The breakfast it tasty complete with local and western cuisine. They have more than 1 restaurant to satisfy guests crave. There is a supermarket near the housing complex to fulfill guests needs. The only downside is that it's quite far from mall and cheap food vendors."

"8.","Alastair Swaffer","257","2025-10-01","4","This is a pleasant hotel by a large chain. Nothing stood out about the hotel but there was nothing bad about it either. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We ate in the rooftop restaurant twice and we're the only diners on both occasions, which is somewhat depressing. Although I unfortunately didn't get a chance to make use of it, the pool looked really nice and inviting. Breakfast in the lobby restaurant was good. Prices for the stay were reasonable."
"9.","Tan Sean","6","2025-11-01","5","I’ve interacted with Fauzan as I was asking for directions and he was amazing in providing clear instructions. He was extremely hospitable and friendly and interacted with me more as a friend than a guest. Amazing service Fauzan! Thank you for making stay wonderful!"

"11.","Aileen","51","2025-10-01","5","Lovely relaxing days in Wyndham! All staff are so friendly from reception, guest relations at door, lift, anywhere in hotel and even those in restaurant (both breakfast and dinner service). Highly recommended for those who want a lake and green view in their rooms with no obstructions to see sunrise. Breakfast is so good with wide variety. Room for two is also slightly more spacious. Though not in city of Batam, hotel provides free shuttle to main malls. Shout out of special thanks to Vinol, Felicia, Sulaiman and all staff involved in morning breakfast service for very warm service! My elderly mum and I will be back for sure!"

"13.","Elanor Devitt","12","2025-09-01","5","A wonderful stay at Wyndham Panbil Batam! They staff are exceptional, so friendly and welcoming. The pool and restaurants are great, as is the on site spa. I liked the breakfast buffet and staff will make you fresh juice which is so lovely. The location is quite far outside Batam Centre (about 10 mins drive) but the free shuttle is helpful for getting around. The location means it’s nice to relax in a quiet location with a beautiful view, and transport around Batam is cheap. They welcomed me with a snack and drink as well as a fruit platter in the room and one restock of the minibar for free which were all welcome additions. I would absolutely stay again. Thank you Wyndham Panbil!"
"14.","sofea malik","13","2025-07-01","1","We stayed here for 3 days and 2 nights, expecting a proper 5-star service but what we got was honestly disappointing. Check-in time was clearly stated as 2 PM on the website, yet we were asked to wait nearly 30 minutes because the room wasn’t ready. After a long flight and feeling exhausted, being told to just wait with nothing more than a simple “sorry” was incredibly frustrating. This wasn’t a budget stay either. We booked a premium room, and expected a level of service to match. To make matters worse, breakfast was a letdown. The options were very limited, food presentation was messy, and nothing stood out in terms of taste. The only saving grace was the smoked salmon, which I used to make my own sandwich but even that doesn’t make up for the lack of variety and quality. For a hotel claiming to be 5-star, the overall experience felt more like a 2-star at best. We won’t be returning, and we definitely don’t recommend it."
"15.","Loo Choon Chwi","409","2025-11-01","5","My no 708 was too cold at night but could not swtch off air conditioner nor adjust it to warmer more comfortable temperature despite setting the temperature value to 30°C. Suggest Wyndham management check this out amd whether there are other rooms with similar issue."
"16.","Feby Septiani","3","2025-08-01","5","Hotelnya bagus, tempatnya nyaman enak buat duduk santai juga tenang👍🏻 (Minus nya ada di SECURITY nya aja👎.) Tlg utk security jangan trlalu arrogant belagu. Yg bermobil gas antar sampai naik ke atas. Kasian yg naik grab motor harus diturunkan kebawah dan gak boleh diantar naik sampai atas. Mesti jalan kaki dr bawah"
"17.","Priya Prakash","268","2025-08-01","1","This is the worst service you’ll experience for a 5-star hotel. Do not recommend. The facilities don’t talk to each other - nothing gets charged to the room during checkout so you’re expected to carry your wallet everywhere you go. Service is pathetic. Queries not answered, people don’t understand basic questions. The restaurant in the ground floor is run unprofessionally. The place looks fancy but they’ve built this up without adequate number or quality of staff on deck. PS: The spa was brilliant!"
"18.","Aisyah Sallim","4","2025-07-01","1","We’re busy adults and decided to go for a short getaway to Batam to celebrate my husband’s birthday. After booking the hotel online, I emailed the hotel directly to request a small birthday decoration and a cake in the room as a surprise for him. The staff responded to my email and confirmed they would arrange a mini set-up in the room on the third day of our stay, as requested. Upon check-in, I even reminded the receptionist about the birthday arrangement to be done on the third day. Unfortunately, the surprise never happened. There was no decoration or cake as promised. Since my husband was with me throughout the stay, I couldn’t follow up with the staff without ruining the surprise. To add to the disappointment, the receptionist also forgot to return my passport after check-in, and I had to remind her that she still had it. The room itself was underwhelming. The toilet was not clean, and the water pressure from the shower head was weak. On top of that, the shower head was not detachable, which made it even more inconvenient. Additionally, the hotel’s location is quite far from most places, which made getting around less convenient. Although there were apologies, the overall experience was unpleasant and not what I expected, especially for a special occasion. Regretfully, I will not be returning to this hotel. This review is based on my opinion and my personal experience."

"21.","Angeline Jennifer","9","2025-09-01","5","I think this was the most nicest hotel in Batam, it’s abit out of the way, 20 - 30 mins from Nagoya and HarbourBay area. The service and the staff and really excellent, the breakfast options can be improved, rather than the typical indo western. I have no complaints on the room as well, it well really clean and made up really well as well. But if you’re planning to stay in, avoid traffic, the Panbil area has a plaza nearby and a nature reserve, has ATV there as well. Overall great place!"
"22.","K M","487","2025-05-01","4","What's great? Service is good. Breakfast spread is wide. Room is clean and well maintained. Gym is good. Executive lake double room is big and comes free Teabreak yummy cakes. Sauna and steam room a bonus at the price point. Get the lake view room! What's to improve? Pool water is murky! visibility in the water is only 1 metre distance. Looks like water filter is spoiled? Or too long in between cleaning. Visit again? Maybe, but please clean the pool. Lobby is renovating now, so take note."

"29.","Ernst Hemmer","128","2025-07-01","2","Disappointing Wyndham. We stayed at this Wyndham Panbil Batam, a former Best Western hotel, from 7 to 11 June 2025, booked with much expectation, but leaving with disappointment. On the plus side, the hotel looks good, having the ambiance of a 5-star, with well furnished spacious rooms, and a beautiful lake view (if you book the lake view side, which we did). A complimentary mini bar was well appreciated, which is a nice touch. The rooftop bar is pleasant with fantastic views, a good menu, with much better food quality than what is served in the main restaurant on the ground floor, and with much better service. We enjoyed the professional service of Mr. Redho. On the down side however, there are several disappointments that impacted our experience. Upon approaching the hotel entrance there is an unpleasant penetrating smell of a sewer, just outside the entrance doors. This feels really unwelcoming. Probably an architectural location error. During our stay there were groups in the hotel, which made it super crowded, especially during meal times. There are only 3 lifts in the lobby, which is insufficient for a building of this size. Another architectural oversight. Queues built up in front of the lifts every morning, and often it took 10 minutes to go up or down. The main disappointment was the Andaliman restaurant on the ground floor, which seemed to have been extended across the lobby space, to accommodate the groups. Quality of the food here was disappointingly poor, mostly overcooked, and was the same every day, whether breakfast or lunch. Coffee was impossible to get during breakfast, as the machines were constantly out of order. Bad quality equipment. We ended up ordering coffee from the lobby bar, against extra pay, just to have a breakfast coffee. The restaurant seemed grossly understaffed, the staff were forgetful (could not remember we asked for something), and seem unhappy with their jobs. Housekeeping also seems to be lacking staff, as our room could only be serviced in the late afternoons. In the room itself, a big surprise was the awkward shower. The shower cabin was fitted with an overhead shower mounted to the wall, but no body-(handheld) shower. Instead there was a low fitted tap, which we had no use for. Showering is therefore a challenging affair, as you’re forced to wash your hair every single time you step into the shower, because all there is is a head shower! This is something we never experienced before in hotels anywhere in Asia, where all hotel bathrooms come at least with body/handheld shower heads. So just for the shower experience alone, we recommend to avoid this hotel. Lastly, there was lack of amenities provided in the bathroom, or at least not replenished when we checked in, so we had to call for a piece of soap and toilet paper, which was brought reluctantly, only after we complained about it twice. The charge for 2 water bottles, placed next the coffee machine, seems almost ridiculous. Why put 2 water bottles there at a cost, while there is already a tank of drinking water provided. This makes no sense at all. Obviously, we did not touch those two bottles. Overall the Wyndham experience is quite disappointing, as this is far from the 5-star hotel that is promoted on the booking sites. It is not a property we will be returning to. The hotel maintenance is lacking, staff need to be trained how to conduct work with happiness toward guests (service delivery training needed), and the main restaurant needs a professional chef to prepare better food. In general, Wyndham hotel management needs an upgrade to begin with."

"33.","Shaun Stephen","15","2025-05-01","1","I’ve stayed at several Wyndham properties in the US without issue, so I came to Panbil Batam expecting the same reliable five star experience. Unfortunately, my stay fell far short of Wyndham standards. 1. Repeated “no smoking” by front desk staff upon check in warnings in a confirmed non-smoking room felt petty. 2. Ordered a 3 egg omelette for buffet breakfast;, got both an omelette and 4-5 fried eggs (7-8 total), plated with BARE HANDS by the staff. 3. Open noodle station attracted so many insects and flies to uncovered ingredients. I’ve attached a photo but its clearer in a video I have but unfortunately cant attach that in this review. The staff was well aware of this situation but took no action. 4. Dusty desk corners, weak air conditioning, and a bathroom drain that clogged up immediately. See attached photo of the clog. 5. Laundry was billed at nearly 4x my actual usage, apparently someone else’s invoice. Once I raised it, the charge was corrected. 6. Only a handful of staff were friendly, but others treated me with less warmth than Western guests, a subtle undercurrent that shouldn’t exist. I hope Wyndham Panbil Batam addresses these fundamental lapses in cleanliness, clear communication before my fellow travelers book here."

"35.","Muhd Mujahid","4","2025-03-01","4","Review for Wyndham Panbil Batam Hotel I had a wonderful stay at Wyndham Panbil Batam. The hotel excels in cleanliness—everything was spotless, and the rooms were well-maintained, truly deserving of a five-star rating in this aspect. The breakfast selection was impressive, offering a wide variety of high-quality options that catered to different tastes. From local delights to international dishes, everything was fresh and well-prepared. Service was almost five-star. Most of the staff were professional, polite, and attentive. However, I did encounter one issue upon arrival. On my first night, I ordered some caffeine, and while doing so, my driver greeted a staff member with “Gong Xi Fa Cai.” The response was rather reluctant, which took me aback. While I understand that people may be tired after a long shift, I believe that good service should be extended to everyone, not just hotel guests. That aside, my overall experience was very positive. I would still highly recommend this hotel for its cleanliness, breakfast quality, and generally excellent service. With just a bit more consistency in hospitality, it would easily be a full five-star experience."

"41.","Warren Bill","14","2025-01-01","1","The rooms were nice but the service was so bad. The food for room service is also very expensive. We ordered room service and the food didn’t come for more than 30 minutes, so I had to order food delivery. The driver can’t use his motorbike to go up to the lobby he needs to walk to the lobby and down again. Very inconvenient. The breakfast was decent but not that good for a hotel with almost 5 stars. The phone provided is so complicated with so many buttons that most of them didn’t even work. The shower in the bathroom is so slippery an elderly could fall in the bathroom. Lift must be pressed hard to even go up or go down. There is no aircon in the lift. The lift looked old. The location is bad, this hotels is surrounded by forests and far from any places. There is no water bottle provided only a water dispenser covered with black cloth. I am kind of worried if the water in the dispenser is even safe to drink or has mold. The path to the gym is so creepy and dimly lit. One of the worst hotels that I have ever visited and I won’t be staying here again."
"42.","James Stirland","4","2025-03-01","1","I am fortunate to travel the world for business reasons and am even more fortunate to have visited Indonesia on 20 occasions. I am also extremely unfortunate however to have stayed at this hotel. The rooms are extremely basic for a 5 star hotel, and the service is utterly atrocious, everything I have tried to order to eat has been unavailable and the restaurants have not been open at the advertised times. The management of this hotel and the staff are in big need of training on how to run and work in a hotel. I am one night into a 10 night stay but will be making a complaint and checking out early. My advice to antibody reading this? Don’t book!!!"
"43.","Dwiana O","12","2025-04-01","1","untuk kategori hotel bintang 5 saya bisa bilang disini servicenya tidak bisa dikategorikan bintang 5. staffnya byk yg tidak ramah. tolong seharusnya lebih di tata lagi untuk fasilitas atau lay out, seperti drop off untuk tamu yg menggunakan fasilitas ojek online. krn hrs memutar dan taruh ktp, berbeda dgn jalur mobil yg langsung bisa ke area drop off tanpa ktp. walaupun menggunakan fasilitas ojek online, tp penumpang tsb jg merupakan tamu hotel. mungkin hotel ini menerapkan konsep kasta sosial."

"45.","S M","177","2025-01-01","5","We stayed at this hotel in August 2024. Our experience was great. We enjoyed clean rooms, wonderful bathroom amenities, excellent food and beverage service and hospitable staff. It felt almost like a home stay because anyone who saw us greeted and conversed with us like we were familiar to them. The staff are also well knowledgeable about the place. In room experiences like dining and laundry are also superb. We also salute their attempts at sustainability such as placing a water canister with a small tap in the room and the overall use of bio degradable and not single use materials. We will meet again! Note : the location is not city Center. It’s tranquil nature and not a shoppers paradise."

The Hygiene of the hotel is a highlight. It is very clean and neat. The room make up service is professional. Everything as expected. Slightly crowded on Weekends, cozy in weekdays. Location is at panbil near nature reserves. Go up to level 15 can see the Great Lake view and the entire Batam. Cannot walk around the hotel, need to Grab to downtown area, but the taxi and grab price is very cheap. Everything convert to SGD felt so much cheaper."

"53.","Andry Pramana","8","2025-05-01","5","Excellent Stay at Wyndham PANBIL Batam I've had the pleasure of staying at Wyndham PANBIL Batam multiple times, and I'm impressed by the consistency of their exceptional service. The front desk staff are friendly and welcoming, making check-in a breeze. The rooms are well-maintained and beautifully designed, with a modern aesthetic that's truly stunning. The welcome amenities are creative and thoughtful, and the free minibar is stocked with a satisfying selection of treats. The swimming pool is impeccably clean, and the water is fresh and well-maintained. The breakfast options are vast, and the taste is consistently delicious. As a repeat guest, I can attest that Wyndham PANBIL Batam has maintained the high standards set by its predecessor, I stayed here since their name still Best western Panbil, The hotel's commitment to excellence is evident in every aspect of the stay. I wholeheartedly recommend Wyndham PANBIL Batam to anyone looking for a comfortable and luxurious stay in Batam. With its excellent service, modern facilities, and attention to detail, this hotel truly deserves its 5-star rating. Rating: 5/5 stars"

There's easy access for Grab rides, there's complimentary shuttle services to get into town and return pickup service with reservations made at the front desk even for transfer to the ferry terminal. A really clean swimming pool to enjoy, a fairly good clean hotel room really meeting my expectations where I rested very well. What more can one ask for for a getaway weekend. Pleasant friendly helpful smiley hotel staff, who are genuinely there to make your stay a pleasant & memorable one. Guess I'll find my comfort here whenever I need a break from a harsh week. Hope you enjoy it too!"

"63.","triana yusmana","15","2025-01-01","5","Hotel bagus,fasilitas lengkap,hanya saja saat selesai makan di resto piring,gelas yg kotor tidak segera diambil. Yg saya tau kalo di hotel lainnya tidak akan membiarkan peralatan makan kotor ada di atas meja meskipun tamu masih berbincang-bincang. Ada satu staf yg bahkan sangat santai membuka handphone dan meletakkan alat makan kotor yang akan dibawa ke belakang di meja saya ketika saya sedang mengambil makanan lain. Bahkan ketika saya datang dia masih sibuk dg handphonnya dan saat makanan saya letakkan barulah dia menutup handphone dan meneruskan pekerjaannya. Maknan dengan bumbu kompleks semacam rendang,lodeh enak dan sangat pas di lidah. Nmaun untuk makanan berbumbu sederhana kurang berasa. Sarapan favorit saya lontong sayur. Sedap sekali sayurnya. Hanya lontongnya tidak dibuat dengan membungkus daun pisang sehingga hambar. Tp tertutupi dengan sayurnya yg enak.View kamar cantik.kebetulan dapat kamar dengan view danau."
"64.","Wynice","22","2024-01-01","4","The location is quite nice and the service is great. Room is generally clean, just that bedsheets had stains… The breakfast had good variety, but there was a long queue when we went down at 9.10am and when we went in there wasn’t much food left. I think would be better if the breakfast can be until 11am so that people can have enough rest and also enough food."

"66.","Matt MacDonald","59","2025-01-01","3","Mixed experience. The foyer is beautiful and the room was modern & clean on the 8th floor with an outstanding view . Buuuuuut the Breakfast was a NIGHTMARE. On a Sunday morning the breakfast was rammed and i mean mobbed, nearly like a riot. There was , no exaggeration, about 50 Korean teenagers just running amok like hooligans and people barging past & noise & chaos. I left my table to get a coffee and when i came back a family had taken it. The coffee machine kept breaking down. People were acting crazy with no manners The problem is they don't have enough seats in the restaurant if the hotel is full , they have extended the seating into the foyer. If you can put up with the horrible breakfast experience maybe come here but honestly if you have to come to ugly boring ghastly batam please stay at Nongsa, Panbil is dead. You can access whatever you need to do from there ."
"67.","Kaitlyn Shi","51","2025-01-01","3","Solidly mediocre hotel. Rooms were very affordable, but the restaurants and bars in the hotel were an absolute ripoff, with poor quality food. The hotel is huge, but in our time there, we did not see very many people there at all. For a Wyndham property, this is quite a disappointing hotel, with staff that are not able to speak English very well. They are very friendly, and tried their best, I'll give them that."

Instead of a complimentary bottle of water in each room, water in a gallon that has been installed for some unknown period of time, and to make coffee with it and drink water when you are thirsty?? The staff who cook breakfast do not know how to grill meat, make omelets, or boil noodles, so you have to ask for them one by one. The meat is completely burnt, the inside of the omelet is undercooked, ???"

Petugas juga cuek tidak menawarkan untuk bantu angkat barang/koper ke dalam mobil. Lain kali tidak akan saya rekomendasikan ke klien klien saya."

Hotel dalam kondisi full occupancy karena ada group booking bank Mandiri, tapi service level tetap optimal to the point mereka offer breakfast takeaway for no extra charge supaya ga terganggu. Fasilitas hotel ini juga lengkap ya. Ada swimming pool, gym, dan 3 restoran dengan specialty yang beda beda. Opsi breakfast juga bagus karena di ganti-ganti setiap harinya. Buat yang stay agak lama tentu hal ini penting banget ya. Seating juga luas dan high capacity. No complaints with my room whatsoever. Amenities lengkap dan juga ada personalisation dari staff. Overall i feel the stay is very worth for the price especially if u take into account your member benefit and the points"

Patrons will come over to your table to take whatever they need, fork, spoon, sugar from your table. YOU NEED TO PROTECT YOUR OWN TABLE!!! I will book this hotel again for my next trip but will skip all meals option. Just not worth the time and getting angry at meal times."

Room I've got was sparkling clean and felt comfy the minute i step in. Only gripe is the AC is too cold. I had to off the room AC to keep myself comfy. The room doors are real solid n heavy but because of that I can easily hear the next rooms closing the door. They did not slam it but because of sheer weight, the bang sound is loud! Hotel breakfast has a good variety but not to the extend of those in a 5star hotel. The hotel is located very near Batamindo Industrial estate, hence very convenient for me. Overall I recommend this hotel to anyone that has business activities at Batamindo industrial estate."

Request kursi tambahan cuma di-iya2in aja (total gw sampe request 4x), petugas hotel kurang ramah:peserta dipaksa masuk meskipun blm dapat kursi wkwkwk gilaak.

Nevertheless, the room had a great view of the lake and the beds and pillows were soft and comfortable. Service was excellent though.

Big TV and quite spacious. Garden view is Facing opposite residences real closely and roof top of ground floor unless you pay for your lake view. Not sure what’s bout the garden view. So don’t mistaken like me that you will see a garden. Room is clean thou and amenities all provided. Bed is comfy too. Breakfast is a wide spread so not too bad just food quality and taste so so only as it’s cold not warmed. Super far from city center. Bout 15 to 30 min taxi journey or more to grand Batam mall, Nagoya and etc. surrounding got nothing but forest and factory. Roof top bar and pool is the only thing is a pro. It has a nice ambience and view. Pool is clean. Has Eska within hotel n guests has discount so quite worth it and convenient. Can stay for a night but Overall, won’t stay here again for the price and location. If less than S$100 SGD might be more worth it."

TV in the room could access netflix and internet as well. Thumbs up for that! The hotel had a fine dining / bar area on top of the building. The view was magnificent! I would highly recommend that.

"83.","Cynthia","131","2025-01-01","5","Having not been to Batam in over 10 years, it was nice to see modern and comfortable lodgings. BWP Panbil is ideally located near to the Batam Ferry terminal, yet still in a restful surroundings atop a little hill and near to a neighbourhood supermarket for basic necessities. The rooms were comfortable and especially the pillows! The pool had a great view and we got to enjoy the spa services too! For a simple getaway, BWP Panbil is a good location especially if you get the room with a water view! The restaurant served a decent breakfast but the saltiness is higher than what we are used to. Having said that, they did their best to accommodate our requests! I also think that coffee is not their forte. Interestingly, lunch had neither coffee or tea served but that's fine as I preferred a more western type of coffee anyway, and found a great cafe about 2.8km away. What stands out for a hotel, which for a few days...is a home away from home, is the exceptional service and hospitality of the staff like Emmy, Irawan, Leo, Mega, and practically everyone that I came in contact with. They served with a smile and much thoughtfulness. When they heard my colleague, who was the main liaison and organiser of our event, was down with a bad flu, they sent her hot honey with lemon to soothe her sore throat. The staff were polite, warm and cheerful! I felt welcome and at home for this weekend getaway! In terms of space for our venue, their ballroom was huge but their sound system has an echo for some reason. They had adequate conference rooms for our needs and we were practically able to occupy a section of the hotel without crossing paths with other guests. There's a nearby Edu /Eco Park for families of youth and kids to enjoy. Good to have such natural environment where all ages can explore! Overall, I will say that if I go to Batam and need a spacious yet quiet hotel, near to the ferry, and a short ride to eateries and cafe, BWP Panbil is worth considering simply cos the staff makes the difference!"

Also had unpleasant experience with one of the breakfast restaurants. They missed giving us information about per head cost, and the restaurant manager kept disturbing us while we were eating our food even after we agreed to whatever changes.

Only came with 1 sink. The height of the sink is so bad that both myself and my partner felt back pain after using. It is too low. The sink also has a strange control. Its a turning knob which doesnt indicate to turn upwards or downwards. After days of using. We still cant remember. The bathtub's drain and the drain next to the toiletbowl was slow and cloggy too. Water took ages to be drained. The bed was ok but the temperature of the aircon was unadjustable. No matter what we did, it stayed the same. The breakfast spread was ok, however, the water flask was so scary. The water came with many tiny black particles. I tried a few cups, all came with black particles. The counter was filled with abandoned cups with those black stuff. The rain shower's pressure was not fantastic either. Should install a hand-held shower head in there too. Since the water pressure from the rainshower is bad. The bedroom slipper was of bad quality, very thin. The toilet room doors (both) are fluted with holes. Aircon, smell and sound will all pass though. Although the room came with a huge gallon of water, but its not sealed, we will never know whether its new/ clean. There was no extra toilet roll. Had to call for extra. Will not stay at this hotel again."

One of the plugs is connected to the phone which is connected to the emergency button. Need to hold the plug while calling for room service . And this means that if you have any emergencies in the room. You might not be able to reach the front desk as the phone might get disconnected due to faulty electrical socket. Maybe is just my room.

"119.","Roz","100","2024-01-01","4","Stayed here for 1 night In terms of location, it is not in a touristy area. OK if you just want to chillax in the room, swim. Get a lake view room, the garden view is more like a 'serviced residence view'. Can only see the garden if you look down. (the garden is actually the smoking area). Room itself is adequate, came with complimentary mini-bar with drinks and snacks. There were 2 cans of beer, maybe could have requested to change to soft drinks instead if you don't drink. They also provided a USB-C cable and standard USB ports for charging by the bedside and on the dresser. Due to the design of the toilet...the acoustics are very good. So everyone in the room can hear you peeing and pooping very clearly. I also found it odd that there were only bath towels and one floor mat. I think one small hand towel would have been useful. The hotel can do away with some of the amenities to reduce waste. Even though the hotel is in quite a forested area, there is a very busy road right outside. So from the pool you can hear the traffic quite clearly. Breakfast buffet was extensive BUT included sushi, teriyaki chicken, kebab rolls, spaghetti and Mongolian BBQ? The standard breakfast items were good: waffles, pancakes, congee, fried rice, sausage, scrambled eggs, hash browns but the other things were out of place. All the hotel staff we interacted with were very polite and helpful. We had trouble getting into our room (a loose screw) and they fixed it quickly even though it was quite late.Our plates were also cleared quickly at breakfast. I tried the spa service. Fuss-free but of coz the price was 2x more than outside. Fitness room was spacious with weights, squat rack, barbell, lots of cardio machines but wished it had a better view. There is a bakery at the serviced residence building (just cut across the garden) where they bake everything fresh, and a supermarket that is actually quite well-stocked (caters to the residents that live in the villas just behind) but the prices are more than a city supermarket. The view of the nature is quite lovely but there are just some quirks that I'm not sure will be enough to get me to come back."

"123.","Abdul Jabbar Kachi","617","2025-01-01","5","First and foremost it is out of the hustle and bustling city view. That means it is quiet, serene, peaceful, calm, romantic, good for family and best for Loving Couples. From the Security guard at the entrance to the receptionist at the counter to the bell boy receiving our bags, to the hotel cleaning staff to the security staff to the dining room staffs, I will the a BIG SALUTE 🫡 Every minute you pass by them, they never fail to greet you, show or directvyou and welcome you with this big smile that you will feel like you are a celebrity or VIP. The surrounding of the hotel, the swimming pool, the Fitness Centre is worth to be there. The breakfast and credit to the Hotel Management for placing every table the Yu Sheng plate, as my stay is during CNY. The choice and spread of breakfast is another worth spending time to dine and taste the various foods on display."
"124.","Nanda Hoppus","329","2022-01-01","4","Spacious room, the check in process is fast. Room was nice, food was good. This hotel have a rooftop restaurant and also a private room for dine in. The lobby is spacious, the room is lovely and bright. Don't forget to bring a converter power plug to type C, G, M. They provide a usb power plug nearby the bed."
"125.","Jerald Kng","1211","2024-01-01","5","Nice hotel, 15mins away from Batam Center ferry terminal, staffs are friendly! The executive suite rooms are impressive, big & comfortable, there was a free high tea sessions from 3 to 6pm once per stay! Enjoyed the facilities like the gym & swimming pool! There’s a convenient Eska in the hotel to do massage, good to do early booking with them! The breakfast has quite a variety but didn’t taste that fantastic. The lift will take awhile if the place is booked out. Overall still a great place to stay in!"
"126.","K","3140","2024-01-01","5","Overall, it was a good stay. Got a free upgrade to lake view and the bed was super huge and comfortable. Lake view was alright (do note that the sun rises from here). The toilet had a lingering pee smell that we can’t seem to identify and get rid of. Service here was excellent. Breakfast (6 to 10am) was not too bad, the noodle soup were the highlight. Location was abit far from the happening places. Delivery will only deliver to the carpark (instead of lobby) due to tight security. Gym was adequate with necessary cardio and strength equipments. Checkout was at 12noon, which was really helpful for chilling in. There’s a supermarket right beside the hotel’s carpark as well."
"127.","J L","6","2018-01-01","5","Nothing short of a great experience. + Staff and service: very warm and welcoming, from the drivers to the receptionists. + Food: buffet breakfast, great spread and variety. Room service food was great. + Room: Clean and spacious. Had a great lake view. + Amenities: Spa and massage with Eska is a cheaper deal than outside. Pool view was beautiful. Rooftop bar was also very chill. Had a wonderful weekend. Give this place a shot; it was very well worth it for us. Definitely coming back in future."
"128.","Aditya Bagaswara","85","2020-01-01","5","They treat me very good. Many tourists came here, especially from Singapore and around. The lobby is big. Restaurants was good but for breakfast i think not many different kind of food served. The taste is ok and clean. The staff was very kind and helpful."
"129.","Faye T.","51","2023-01-01","2","Staff are nice and friendly. Stayed in the executive room - huge and comfortable. Bed was ok, slightly soft imo. Pillow was comfortable. Bathroom was big and it comes with a sizeable bathtub, which is great. The bathrobes are super comfy. There’s also a coffee machine in the room. Downside of the room - dim, dusty, kinda stuffy (ventilation not done v well), and power plugs are flaky. Wide spread of breakfast at L1, but a little salty to my personal likings. Executive lounge was cozy, smaller spread with great view overseeing the lake at L15. It was a disappointment to find out indoor smoking are allowed in the executive lounge. (They told us they installed exhaust fan at the corner of the room to keep the smoke away. We weren’t happy with that explanation, quite sure that’s not how it works). Parents with young kids, or individuals with respiratory issues might want to take note of that. Live band music was loud (ear piercing pitch) at the lobby in the evening so we went to the rooftop bar for an evening drink but was turned away as they “only serves set menu”. Environment was nice, would be nice to have had dinner if we had time. Overall, It was an OK stay, quite far from everything. It is unfortunate we didn’t enjoy our time in this hotel. At this price point, I wouldn’t recommend."

"135.","Seto Danu","314","2023-01-01","5","this is a nice hotel with great view if you choose the forest view of Duriangkang. In the morning you will be greeted by green color with splashing of orange color of sun hitting the water on the horizon with have floating here and there. With the huge glass window-wall, surely you can lay down and enjoy the nature. below you can also see the main road and how busy it will be in several time in a day. this hotel also has a nice swimming pool that is large enough to splash around and enjoy the tree tops. The room itself, I will consider as spacious with enough room to move. the breakfast and the meal option is also great. The only downpoint for me is that the location of the hotel is a bit out-there. so if you want to hit the downtown or great malls, you will need transportation to bring you here and there...surely will require the time."
"136.","Ramnik Bali","36","2020-01-01","4","Good place for business trip. Its away from commercial areas. For leisure or holidays, there are lot of good properties near city centre. This is very strange but the staff at reception does not advise guests to block money while checking in. So if you order room service, you need to pay by cash or credit card. Well giving credit card to staff to take it to cashier is not safe. My advise to all guests is to block money so your card is safe and secured."
"137.","Rose Angelique","41","2024-01-01","4","Kamarnya bagus dan nyaman, interior oke, breakfast variatif. Lokasi hotel jauh dari pusat kota dan pusat belanja tapi deket bandara sih. hotel juga dekat pusat industri jadi macet di jam pulang kerja."

"139.","Ting Yang Lim","18","2018-01-01","3","Location is okay. Not near anything. Room is well furnished. But I booked a double bed but was given a twin. They did not try to upgrade me to a room that had a double bed. Service at the pool was slow. Ordered a pizza which took 30 minutes to come. Took a while to get the bill too. Had to go for a swim first."

"145.","Amos Sim","81","2020-01-01","4","The rooms are nicely laid out. Good sized table to work on but the electrical socket is hidden just behind the wooden swing up cover, below the table top. This design takes away useful table space for placing the laptop to work on. Lots of parking space but the exit for the parking is a bit confusing. When I was there the elevators to the parking lots were not working for several days. But the 2 floor to walk up and down daily was a good exercise. Fortunately the elevators to the rooms were working fine."

Also,Special thanks to front office manager Mr. Ade Kurniawan .He offered the best service I have ever had. Although my husband and I were just there picking up my stuff without staying, he bothered to call a taxi and let us wait comfortably at the lobby while he kept looking out for the taxi arrival despite his busy schedule. He really cannot go any further than this. Our heartfelt thanks for the great service."

"148.","Aprillia Cindy Damian","20","2023-01-01","2","My husband and I came to Batam for a short weekend getaway and this is our first trip together since the pandemic hit. In the past we stayed in a 4 star hotel near city center but on this current trip we decided to stay away from the buzzing city. Hence, we picked Best Western Premier Pandil because it looked promising from the pictures and Google reviews. Day 1, checked in, friendly receptionist and free welcome drinks. We came earlier than the normal check in hour but fortunately there's an available room so they let us checked in. Got a coupon for welcome drinks and snack at the bar next to the reception counter. We went to the bar and waited for about 15 minutes. No server was around then we asked the receptionist and waited for another 10 minutes until we could order our beverages. Went into the room, view was gorgeous as we could see the beautiful lake surrounded by the greenery. Next, we found a little unexpected visitor which is a cockroach on the floor. The room is not hygienic at all as we noticed so much dust on the floor and surface. Let me enlighten you that this hotel is rated 5 star. Day 2, came down to buffet breakfast around 915am, to our surprise the restaurant looked messy as there're many dirty dishes were not cleaned, empty dishes and when we asked whether there's any refill for some of the dishes, the reply was no. The juices were not chilled, the egg station didn't have toppings for your omelette. Let me enlighten you that this hotel is rated 5 star. Next, we came down to the pool, it was a pretty great infinity pool with the lake view. We've got thirsty since the weather was pretty nice and sunny, wanted to order some drinks. No one was at the towel counter. There was an instruction to dial a number and ordered directly from restaurant. We called, was connected to operator then the lady said hold the line while being transferred to the restaurant. Waited for 10mins and no answer. Finally a guy showed up at the counter so we ordered some juices and sodas and we waited for about 30 minutes. There's still no sign for our drinks. Let me enlighten you that this hotel is rated 5 star. We still have another night to spend and spa day. Fingers crossed, it will get better from here. In conclusion, don't stay in this hotel if you're expecting a 5 star quality and service. Those 4 stars hotels are MUCH WORTH your money honestly. Being able to go on a vacation is a luxury itself and this Best Western Premier Batam is totally overrated and they should be just rated as 3.5 star max as the other best western hotels that I know of globally."
"149.","Faizul Rahman","271","2020-01-01","5","From front desk to housekeeping to the security and bellman and to all the staff with a beautiful smile in regardless of the time.

"150.","Roy Naldi","2","2024-01-01","5","Very recommended place to stay. if you looking for healing but nearby city center. Best Western is the right place to choose.

"151.","Hooke Wando","360","2021-01-01","5","Probably the best hotel to stay in Batam, all things considered. Location isn’t the most ideal, but can be managed with a little bit of planning (it’s a little in the middle of nowhere for walking, but shuttle services are available and it’s not far from the populated areas by taxi). Love the infinity pool with the view of nature. There’s also a poolside Barbecue buffet at a reasonable price. Do check out the rooftop bar too, which has one of the best views on the island. The staff are generally friendly and they seem to make an effort to ensure a comfortable stay for guests. Value for money too. No major complaints, except the cockroaches in the male toilets on the ground floor."
"152.","Edith Yuen","6","2024-01-01","4","Good service. Special highlight your staff, Sartika, she is very friendly and helpful. Always with a beautiful welcome smile.

"158.","Alex Rowe","35","2025-01-01","1","I've been trying to book a room at this hotel. Their website won't let guests choose the bed conguration between double and twin. The whatsapp chat person says its allocated on arrival and you won't know what you're getting until you arrive. So 2 people may have to share a double bed even if they don't want to. This is a dreadful way to run a hotel."
"159.","Florence Kaye Del Rosario","9","2023-01-01","5","We booked 5 suites room for our short Christmas holiday. One of the best 5 star hotels in Bintan! Location is great as it is near the ferry terminal (15-20 mins by car) Affordable and worth it the price. The hotel service was forthcoming. The staff are very attentive and prompt to our requests. Rooftop dinner is amazing. Nice food and breath taking view. Breakfast has wide variety. Our group felt we are well taken care off. I would also like to comment one the staff named Angga. He is really helpful all through out in our stay, from check in, Christmas dinner, breakfast & check out. He is one of the reasons why we had a wonderful customer service experience. Kudos to the team and Angga! Would definitely love to come back to this hotel again."

Excellent hotel and highly recommended!"
"161.","Dudley Lin","53","2019-01-01","5","Amazing rooms at extremely affordable prices. Service was good and impeccable. Room service is on for 24 hours so you can order to your heart's content. One downside would be the location, since it's located quite remotely, getting to local attractions would be quite a hassle, but there are shuttle services provided to Nagoya hill, and the nearest mall down the road is Kepri Mall, which you still require a taxi to get down there. Rooftop bar has an amazing view with live band playing, the infinity pool also boasts pretty good views. There is a warm jacuzzi as well."
"162.","Eka Handa","262","2019-01-01","5","Hotelnya cakep banget, modern tapi tetep mengusung nilai lokal seperti pemberian nama meeting room bernuansa Melayu dan salah satu resto yang diberi nama Andaliman (salah satu bumbu khas Batak). Dari Bandara Internasional Hang Nadim, hanya dibutuhkan waktu sekitar 20 menit untuk mencapai lokasi BWP. Sedangkan dari Pelabuhan Ferry Batam Centre hanya memerlukan waktu 15 menit. Jika di Eling bening ada Danau Rawa Pening, di BWP kita melihat pemandangan Dam Duriangkang, hanya saja dari rooftop BWP tidak ada pemandangan gunung. Untuk Superrior dan Deluxe Room terdapat dua tempat tidur alias twin bed, desain kamarnya klasik modern. Executive room, didalamnya terdapat sebuah lemari besar, beberapa sofa dan ada bathub di dalam kamar mandi. Secara keseluruhan, fasilitas kamar yang disediakan antara lain adalah LED TV flat screen dengan pilihan berbagai channel, water kettle, hair dryer, wifi, meja kerja, kamar mandi dengan shower dan mini bar yang bisa kita nikmati dan itu free. Terdapat dua macam jenis juice, dua macam snack, dua minuman kaleng dan saru mineral water. Fasilitas yang ditawarkan pihak hotel selain wifi gratis adalah layanan free call untuk tamu yang menginap di BWP. Selain itu ada juga layanan shuttle bus untuk keperluan belanja, tujuannya adalah Mega Mall dan Nagoya Hill. Untuk pengantaran tersedia di jam 10.00 dan jam 12 siang, sedangkan untuk penjemputan tersedia di jam 2.00 dan jam 4.00 sore. Untuk penjemputan tamu juga tersedia, hanya saja terbatas untuk mereka yang minta penjemputan dari dan ke terminal ferry Batam Centre."

"166.","Travel And food","227","2020-01-01","5","The lobby and welcome area was a let down but don't be deceive by it Rooms are really nice, lots of attention to details and they really have great managers and staffs. Their customer service is really awesome and beat many hotels in Singapore hands down in terms of service. Although location is really 1 star, they team make up with their willingness to serve and to please. They have gone beyond their duty to assist me when I needed to change my dates and even gave me a special treat to the ferry terminal at my own timing besides upgrading me to a really nice room. This hotel provide free shuttle to ferry terminal and shopping malls and take pains to ensure guests are well taken care of. However, free shuttle to malls are only in the afternoon. Since the location is their main weakness, I like to suggest that they should consider providing free 2 hours sightseeing in the morning to the famous Batam bridge etc. They have the shuttle bus , the drivers as fixed cost so spending a little money on gas could help them win more business. Special mention to Robert who is like the hotel's Ambassador. He is warm, friendly and so obliging. He would make a great tour guide and turn the hotel guests' stay at BWPP into an experience instead of just a place to sleep. Breakfast is amazing, I cannot believe they event have sushi chef preparing Japanese breakfast besides the usual egg station and noodle station. This hotel is a must for foodie who loves big breakfast"
"167.","Federico Scordo","111","2024-01-01","3","Nice room with view,good staff,but.... Breakfast was a total mess. I know this was during a busy period (CNY) but a hotel such as Western Premier must be ready for his full capacity. Rampage of people looking for food and eyeing the staff who refills the empty stations like hungry fishes swimming towards feeders. Though the scene was as entertaining as watching Nat Geo, its preferable with enough food on my table."

Jangan terkejut ketika anda melihat makanan tidak sesuai ekspektasi karena menunya menggunakan bahasa Inggris dan yg dtg makanan Indonesia bgt . Hehe . Ruangan Sholat sangat bagus. Nyaman dan bersih . Cukup besar tidak seperti tempat lainnya . Ornamen di dalam hotel juga sangat bagus . Kalian bisa foto foto disana. Walau tidak sebesar hotel lainnya . Tapi BWP Juga bisa jadi tempat menginap kalian selama liburan di Batam . Atau tempat untuk kalian membuat acara pernikahan dan perpisahan maupun acara lainnya. . Untuk tamu anak anak ada ice cream dan photobooth yg diberikan ,jika pelaksana acara yg menggunakan ballroom membayar untuk itu."

The heater takes some time to heat the water, around 10 minutes. The shower area was not built properly as the water doesn't drain well. So the area tends to get a bit flooded. The wall sockets are of UK type, which is good for me as I don't need to use an adapter. However, the electric kettle provided requires the 2 cylindrical pin type, typical of Indonesian electrical appliances, which I find it odd. However the hotel staff were able to provide one quickly. Breakfast was yummy, serving mostly Indonesian local dishes, a few selections of western, vegetarian dishes and pastries. The food offered at the restaurants and lounges were good too. Do try the mee goreng mamak. Overall I had a pleasant stay. Btw, the Singapore Consulate is located here as well, if you need to seek their assistance."

"188.","Isaac Lim","16","2019-01-01","4","First thing first, the wifi here is fast and reliable throughout the hotel. Facilities are new and clean. Maintenence is well done. We're having a retreat here, so it being not so accessible is not so much an issue. As for the food, meat dishes and fruits are not too bad. The vegetables and dessert however, are a little lacking. Swimming pool is a little on the small size. The rooms are clean and well equipped. Has KTV and massage too."

"198.","Moon","5","2023-01-01","1","Service is very bad compared to pre-covid. I’ve been staying in this hotel everytime I come Batam, about 4-5 times a year. It’s a 5-star rated hotel. I have always stayed in a suite room. Previously there was complimentary high tea everyday of our stay, and a guest relations officer will knock on our door to say she will be taking care of our stay here. We feel really good. Subsequently, there is no more guest relations officer, and complimentary high tea is only for one day of our entire stay. Moving to now, there is no more complimentary high tea for us. But it’s ok, we wanted to order and pay for our high tea, but a whole bad experience awaits us. We went to the 15th floor bar to ask about it, and was told that the high tea would be rp150,000 at Kayu Manis bar. The next day, we called premier assistance to reconfirm that the high tea will be available at Kayu Manis bar and was told it’s a yes. When we went down to the bar, the lady there says there is no high tea available. We went to the reception counter to ask, the staffs also informed us there is no high tea available. When we continued to probe (since we were told by the staff at 15th floor as well as premier assistance staff that it’s available), staff Fitri called the restaurant. After that, she apologised that she gave us the wrong information when we called the premier assistance (she was the staff who answered the call), and that she thought we were referring to the FREE high tea. So all the while when we were talking to her, in front of her for the past 10 mins, she thought we were asking for the FREE high tea?! Even though I mentioned the 15th floor staff told us it would be rp150,000! We felt insulted! She thinks we are so cheap people insisting on free food?! So we finally made our order for high tea, and guess what? We wait for 1.5hrs for it to arrive! Let me remind you this is a 5-star rated hotel. In addition, the breakfast buffet has very limited spread now. Previously the spread was fantastic. Now it has gone from bad to worse, it’s pathetic now. 5-star rated hotel with 3-star breakfast spread. And the main restaurant only serves Chinese food now. We do not go to Batam looking for Chinese food. Food is not fantastic, prawns are not fresh either. Variety is very limited too. And we were told that we have to go to Kayu Manis bar if we want to order western food. But there are no proper tables to eat in that bar! And everytime we order something, we have to wait for about 40 mins to 1 hour (or more) for the food to arrive. Overall, I’m so disappointed in the hotel now. Previously I swear by the hotel everytime I come to Batam because it makes me feel so welcome. Now I will have to give other hotels a chance already. Both thumbs down! Not recommended unless you’re willing to pay 5-star amount for 3-star service and food."
"199.","Adrienne","59","2020-01-01","4","5 stars for the price of the stay! Would have been great if the toilet came with a bathtub. Otherwise theres nothing much to complain about for this price. Breakfast buffet was ok, the staff helped to specially craft the latte for us. Thank you! Do try out the ESKA spa within this hotel too. However, note that there is an extra 21% charge for purchase of any of the massage packages."
"200.","Dion Tan","11","2019-01-01","5","The place was great. I highly recommend everyone to come here. Great accomodation, great hospitality and great breakfast buffet. The infinity pool was magnificient as well. Extra perks would be that you would have access to a gym, Whirlpool (Jacuzzi), sauna and steam room as well. All in all, a really great place to go. Nothing much that is truly unsatisfying. The only small problems are that the room service fish and chips was bad. The fish was too dry and the fries extremely mushy. Cost was about 85k. Still cheap, but definitely not ordering again. Would not recommend the room service."
"201.","Djeng Yokhe","33","2019-01-01","1","One of brand new hotels in Batam, 5 stars, but SADLY they have the WORST attitude! So, I was invited to attend a Seminar Kebangsaan with Kesbangpol Batam a few days ago.. (15 August 2018 at Sisoding Ballroom).. I was asking about their wi-fi to one of their staff and he answered in a rude way, Yes, correct.. This one is our Wi-fi.. But, next time please don't ask me, ask the committee! I have a lot things to do now and if there are 350 people are asking me about the Wi-fi, I will get a bad headache!!.. I'm so sorry, I can't tell you his name because his name-badge was hard to read, uncontrast with his uniform.. I only remember his face, he is a thin&tall man and he was the only one whose wearing a long black suit, perhaps the chief of the housekeeping for the event, I'm not sure.. That was my very 1st time BAD EXPERIENCE with a 5 stars hotel.. Such a shame! Saya jg akan menulis reviewnya dlm Bahasa Indonesia, krn siapa tahu Pihak Manajemen Hotel akan membacanya.. Salah satu hotel baru di Batam, bintang 5, tapi memiliki staf dgn sikap TERBURUK yg pernah saya alami! Jadi, saya diundang ikut Seminar Kebangsaan dengan Kesbangpol Batam beberapa hari yang lalu.. (15 Agustus 2018 di Sisoding Ballroom).. Saya bertanya tentang wi-fi mereka ke salah satu staf mereka dan dia menjawab dengan cara yang kasar, Ya, benar .. Yang ini adalah Wi-fi kami .. Tapi, lain kali tolong jangan tanya saya, tanyakan pada panitia! Saya punya banyak pekerjaan sekarang dan jika ada 350 orang yang menanyakan saya tentang Wi-fi, saya pusing!! .. Saya mohon maaf tidak bisa memberitahumu namanya karena lencana namanya sulit untuk dibaca, tdk kontras dengan warna seragamnya .. Saya hanya ingat wajahnya, dia adalah pria yang kurus & tinggi dan dia adalah satu-satunya yang mengenakan jas hitam panjang, mungkin kepala para petugas untuk acara tersebut, saya tidak yakin .. Itu adalah pengalaman BURUK saya utk pertamakalinya dengan hotel bintang 5 ..Sungguh sangat disayangkan sekali! Baru kali ini saya mendapat perlakuan seperti ini seumur hidup saya! 😭😭 P.S: Walaupun saya tdk bs membaca nama petugas yg KASAR itu, tp saya rasa petunjuk2 yg saya berikan sdh cukup utk melacak siapa oknumnya(krn cuma dia petugas hotel yg pakai jas hitam panjang pd acara itu).. Saya tdk mengada-ada dlm hal ini.. Saya benar-benar kecewa dgn pelayanannya.. Semoga ke depannya ada perbaikan.."

We got a taxi at the ferry terminal to reach the hotel (roughly around 7 SGD) and booked a Grab from hotel to ferry when returning. Great food, there was a band playing on both the nights we stayed (Friday and Saturday). The pool table was free for those dining at the restaurant (can’t remember the name of the restaurant). There’s an Eska spa branch in the hotel (prices are reasonable and service was good). There’s a mall within walking distance to the hotel (unfortunately we did not try it as we were too comfy in our junior suite :) ). We even got the best western membership card for booking a junior suite where we got 50% discount for all food. Would definitely return to this hotel."

They also have a big whirlpool, a normal sauna and a steam sauna. Again, all of it is clean and and you have a good feeling about it. I have to add, it is usally only for guests of the hotel and not public. Only for info, so you will not be disappointed. For the restaurant, it looks very nice and the waiters are very friendly (that goes for all other hotel workers, that i met, too). Still for a hotel of this category they still could be a little more attentively. Ya, just sayin. Iam not a snob, but other people might be a bit more critical. My wife, my niece and me had steaks and my mother in law had the tom-yam-soup. The taste of the steak was very good only the portion of the side dishes was a bit too small for my opinon. But ya, we usually eat a lot so maybe we are not the ones to judge that hahaha. The tom-yam-soup was good, too. Of course the prices are a bit high compared to the local restaurants but still acceptable if you ask me. Overall it was a good experience."

The crew service is outstanding, on my second night, my key card is not working starting from the elevator, I report it immediately to the front office, they escort me to the room. Unfortunately, the key card is not working too, they offer me to wait near the elevator (they provide sofas). And then I waited again, until they check and detect its the door's key battery is also ran out. Therefore, they offer me to wait again and this time I choose to the lobby, they offer me any drinks, so I take the mineral water. Finally, all set and it took me about half an hour. Kudos for the hotel crews for their professional communication and attention for the guest."

For the room, it is spaces and quite clean but saw 3 small cockroaches at living room and toilet. Furthermore, these are found in the executive suite. For breakfast, I suggest the food can be covered at all times because I can see some flies around sometimes even on guest tables. The restaurant offered truly international breakfast that includes local, chinese, japanese, malay, western & etc. Estimated more than 50 types food varieties. This is hardly can see a hotel that serving international breakfast. The overall experience is nice but there are some improvements and can do it better. Hopefully when back in future, they will make it even better."

In the middle of nowhere, have to depend on hotel shuttle to get to Nagoya Hills or Megamall. No shops nearby. Korean restaurant within hotel is good. Breakfast is average. This area has a huge Korean presence, from hotel guests to the long term serviced residence guests. Noisy group of Korean tourists made a hell lot of loud noises in the middle of the night at the passageway, talking loudly, slamming doors and knocking on each other’s room doors. Basically, they unleashed their uncouth behaviour everywhere. Wont be back here, Radisson nearby is a much better choice."

Room was tidy with free mini bar and clean bathroom though the shower floor is slippery when wet. Our towels had a tiny stain which housekeeping replaced. We originally booked a non-smoking superior room with double bed, but due to lack of rooms they upgraded us to deluxe with twin beds which hotel staff helped us to combine together. Breakfast buffet spread had a decent variety of western and asian cuisines. Room service and staff were very kind and attentive to details. Do note free shuttle bus service to and from Nagoya Hill/Megamall needs booking beforehand as slots are limited. Swimming pool and gym were clean. Will definitely recommend this hotel for those who want a hotel away from the city with decent amenities."

It was an obvious scam as they conveniently have another 1 star hotel nearby to house all of us, EVEN AT NO EXTRA CHARGE. Even if we did move to the 1 star hotel, they wouldn't refund us the difference in price. The exterior and the newness of the hotel might get you at first, but with the way they conduct their business, I would never stay at this or the other affiliate hotels ever."

Mr Rohmat Basuki really goes all way out to give his best service and remembers our food preferences after the first day. I will be back for the excellent service."
"329.","Suban Hartono","34","2019-01-01","5","You can have a family gathering here, its not a bad place to chill out and have a good meal. They also are full of facilities that would just spoil you and your girlfriend. Even for locals, this place is a must go for a weekend getaway"
"330.","Agus Sumarsono","89","2022-01-01","4","Tempat yang sangat representatif sebenarnya dengan segala fasilitasnya Namun sangat disayangkan ada celah pintu yg terbuka dan tidak dapat ditutup rapat serta bisa diintip dari luar utamanya koridor pada Kamar 1010"

"332.","RayRayRay Tan","944","2020-01-01","2","Best Western Rewards and Suite Room Patrons beware! Hotel manager doesn’t understand how to run hotel for VIP, Platinum or other frequent stay guests. Staff have been trained to think the 5PM to 6PM cocktail hour in the executive lounge is the time you use the welcome drink voucher for the hotel. This is absolutely ludicrous/insane. 1) the Executive Club Lounge was completely shut during my stay 2) no welcome drink voucher was provided at check in 3) a letter stating my privileges was left in my room but these privileges don’t actually exist on this property ! 4) I did have a couple drinks between 5PM and 6PM on the date of my stay, the management refused to comp this despite there clearly being an amenity for the stay As someone who stays in hotels approx 200 days a year (for work), Accor Platinum, IHG Royal Ambassador Spire Élite, Marriott Bonvoy Lifetime Platinum, this hôtel just can’t compare. Waiting for the Marriott Harbour Center Batam to open - then I can be done with substandard run down rooms like this. Pros: staff are friendly and not always pestering you for tips, location fairly central and never have horrible traffic woes departing or arriving. Cons: cheap management, parts of the hotel obviously need repair/refresh like mould in the shower, broken shower doors, a real minibar (free minibar with only a couple cans of soda and water and crackers is a joke). Overall, I don’t think I can ever stay on this property again - this doesn’t live up to the Bear Western Premier name at all. Best Western at best."
"333.","James Long III","130","2019-01-01","5","Probably one of the best hotels in Batam. The view from 3rd floor pool deck is spectacular. They have Jacuzzi that makes you feel your sitting in a fish bowl. 😁 Major problem w Hotel BWP is it's simply away from everything. 😫 So you must enjoy hotel otherwise malls, shopping, restraurants, etc all require a car to get too. The hotel is very nice. Rooms have the quality you'd expect at this price point. Since it's new hotel (less than 1yr old), everything still in good condition."
"334.","Julia Carolina","16","2018-01-01","5","Came here for breakfast and dinner buffets. Dinner buffet was an excellent spread of local flavours like delicious Indonesian beef stew (soto betawi) and siomay bandung. Ingredients used for the buffet were fresh! Service provided was attentive and pleasant. All servers understood and could speak basic English. The hotel is new and has one of the cleanest hotel toilets in Batam :) I also went to try massage at the ESKA spa (2nd floor) and had one of the best massages of my life! Great hotel! 👍"

Bagi awam, arah ke lobby dari parkiran motor lumayan membingungkan karena tidak ada arah yang jelas, awalnya malah saya salah masuk lewat eskalator yang mati dan gelap, jadi sebaiknya dibuat papan arah ke lobby 2. Security portal gak jelas, malah nanya: mau ke mana pak? Dan itu cuma ditanyakan ke pelanggan yang naik motor. Kenapa yang mobil tidak ditanya juga? Apa karena perbedaan kasta? Bintang 1 untuk security portal, Bintang 5 untuk Best Western Premier Panbil Batam, terima kasih! 😘"

Request kursi tambahan cuma di-iya2in aja (total gw sampe request 4x), petugas hotel kurang ramah:peserta dipaksa masuk meskipun blm dapat kursi wkwkwk gilaak.

"483.","Djeng Yokhe","33","2019-01-14","1","One of brand new hotels in Batam, 5 stars, but SADLY they have the WORST attitude! So, I was invited to attend a Seminar Kebangsaan with Kesbangpol Batam a few days ago.. (15 August 2018 at Sisoding Ballroom).. I was asking about their wi-fi to one of their staff and he answered in a rude way, Yes, correct.. This one is our Wi-fi.. But, next time please don't ask me, ask the committee! I have a lot things to do now and if there are 350 people are asking me about the Wi-fi, I will get a bad headache!!.. I'm so sorry, I can't tell you his name because his name-badge was hard to read, uncontrast with his uniform.. I only remember his face, he is a thin&tall man and he was the only one whose wearing a long black suit, perhaps the chief of the housekeeping for the event, I'm not sure.. That was my very 1st time BAD EXPERIENCE with a 5 stars hotel.. Such a shame! Saya jg akan menulis reviewnya dlm Bahasa Indonesia, krn siapa tahu Pihak Manajemen Hotel akan membacanya.. Salah satu hotel baru di Batam, bintang 5, tapi memiliki staf dgn sikap TERBURUK yg pernah saya alami! Jadi, saya diundang ikut Seminar Kebangsaan dengan Kesbangpol Batam beberapa hari yang lalu.. (15 Agustus 2018 di Sisoding Ballroom).. Saya bertanya tentang wi-fi mereka ke salah satu staf mereka dan dia menjawab dengan cara yang kasar, Ya, benar .. Yang ini adalah Wi-fi kami .. Tapi, lain kali tolong jangan tanya saya, tanyakan pada panitia! Saya punya banyak pekerjaan sekarang dan jika ada 350 orang yang menanyakan saya tentang Wi-fi, saya pusing!! .. Saya mohon maaf tidak bisa memberitahumu namanya karena lencana namanya sulit untuk dibaca, tdk kontras dengan warna seragamnya .. Saya hanya ingat wajahnya, dia adalah pria yang kurus & tinggi dan dia adalah satu-satunya yang mengenakan jas hitam panjang, mungkin kepala para petugas untuk acara tersebut, saya tidak yakin .. Itu adalah pengalaman BURUK saya utk pertamakalinya dengan hotel bintang 5 ..Sungguh sangat disayangkan sekali! Baru kali ini saya mendapat perlakuan seperti ini seumur hidup saya! 😭😭 P.S: Walaupun saya tdk bs membaca nama petugas yg KASAR itu, tp saya rasa petunjuk2 yg saya berikan sdh cukup utk melacak siapa oknumnya(krn cuma dia petugas hotel yg pakai jas hitam panjang pd acara itu).. Saya tdk mengada-ada dlm hal ini.. Saya benar-benar kecewa dgn pelayanannya.. Semoga ke depannya ada perbaikan.."

Bagaimana kalau saya sdg mandi tdk menggunakan pakaian? Saya sgt kesal krna tdk bs tdr nyenyak dgn byk kejadian2 itu .

"526.","Priya Prakash","268","2025-08-14","1","Ini adalah layanan terburuk yang akan Anda alami untuk hotel bintang 5. Tidak direkomendasikan. Fasilitasnya tidak terhubung satu sama lain - tidak ada biaya yang dibebankan ke kamar saat check-out, jadi Anda diharapkan membawa dompet ke mana pun Anda pergi. Pelayanannya menyedihkan. Pertanyaan tidak dijawab, orang-orang tidak mengerti pertanyaan dasar. Restoran di lantai dasar dikelola secara tidak profesional. Tempatnya terlihat mewah, tetapi mereka membangunnya tanpa jumlah atau kualitas staf yang memadai. PS: Spa-nya luar biasa!"
"527.","이명선","30","2025-12-14","1","Dipasarkan sebagai hotel bintang lima, tapi sebenarnya lebih seperti hotel bintang empat. Nggak perlu jauh-jauh ke sini. Tapi, enak juga ada tempat jus untuk sarapan."
"528.","sofea malik","13","2025-07-14","1","Kami menginap di sini selama 3 hari 2 malam, mengharapkan layanan bintang 5 yang layak, tetapi apa yang kami dapatkan sungguh mengecewakan. Waktu check-in tertera jelas pukul 14.00 di situs web, namun kami diminta menunggu hampir 30 menit karena kamar belum siap. Setelah penerbangan panjang dan merasa lelah, disuruh menunggu tanpa ucapan apa pun selain maaf sungguh sangat menjengkelkan. Ini bukan penginapan hemat. Kami memesan kamar premium, dan mengharapkan tingkat layanan yang sesuai. Lebih buruk lagi, sarapan sangat mengecewakan. Pilihannya sangat terbatas, penyajian makanan berantakan, dan tidak ada yang istimewa dari segi rasa. Satu-satunya hal yang menyelamatkan adalah salmon asap, yang saya gunakan untuk membuat sandwich sendiri, tetapi itu pun tidak cukup untuk menutupi kurangnya variasi dan kualitas. Untuk hotel yang mengklaim sebagai bintang 5, pengalaman keseluruhan terasa lebih seperti bintang 2 saja. Kami tidak akan kembali, dan kami jelas tidak merekomendasikannya."
"529.","BJ K","2","2025-12-14","1","Suasana di lobi larut malam seperti pasar pagi dengan staf restoran bernyanyi dan mengobrol sekeras-kerasnya. Ini hotel bintang 5??"
"530.","Aisyah Sallim","4","2025-07-14","1","Kami, orang dewasa yang sibuk, memutuskan untuk berlibur singkat ke Batam untuk merayakan ulang tahun suami saya. Setelah memesan hotel secara online, saya langsung mengirim email ke pihak hotel untuk meminta dekorasi ulang tahun kecil dan kue di kamar sebagai kejutan untuknya. Staf hotel membalas email saya dan mengonfirmasi bahwa mereka akan mengatur dekorasi mini di kamar pada hari ketiga kami menginap, sesuai permintaan. Saat check-in, saya bahkan mengingatkan resepsionis tentang pengaturan ulang tahun yang akan dilakukan pada hari ketiga. Sayangnya, kejutan itu tidak pernah terjadi. Tidak ada dekorasi atau kue seperti yang dijanjikan. Karena suami saya bersama saya selama menginap, saya tidak bisa menghubungi staf tanpa merusak kejutannya. Yang menambah kekecewaan, resepsionis juga lupa mengembalikan paspor saya setelah check-in, dan saya harus mengingatkannya bahwa paspornya masih ada. Kamarnya sendiri kurang memuaskan. Toiletnya kurang bersih, dan tekanan air dari kepala pancurannya lemah. Selain itu, kepala pancurannya tidak bisa dilepas, yang membuatnya semakin tidak nyaman. Selain itu, lokasi hotel cukup jauh dari kebanyakan tempat, sehingga kurang nyaman untuk bepergian. Meskipun ada permintaan maaf, pengalaman menginap secara keseluruhan tidak menyenangkan dan tidak sesuai harapan saya, terutama untuk acara khusus. Sayangnya, saya tidak akan kembali ke hotel ini. Ulasan ini berdasarkan pendapat dan pengalaman pribadi saya."
"531.","Shaun Stephen","15","2025-05-14","1","Saya telah menginap di beberapa properti Wyndham di AS tanpa masalah, jadi saya datang ke Panbil Batam dengan harapan mendapatkan pengalaman bintang lima yang sama. Sayangnya, pengalaman menginap saya jauh di bawah standar Wyndham. 1. Peringatan dilarang merokok yang berulang kali diberikan oleh staf resepsionis saat check-in di kamar yang seharusnya bebas rokok terasa remeh. 2. Memesan omelet 3 telur untuk sarapan prasmanan; mendapatkan omelet dan 4-5 telur goreng (total 7-8), disajikan dengan TANGAN KOSONG oleh staf. 3. Stasiun mi yang terbuka menarik banyak serangga dan lalat ke bahan-bahan yang tidak tertutup. Saya telah melampirkan foto, tetapi lebih jelas dalam video yang saya miliki, tetapi sayangnya tidak dapat melampirkannya dalam ulasan ini. Staf sangat menyadari situasi ini tetapi tidak mengambil tindakan. 4. Sudut meja berdebu, AC lemah, dan saluran pembuangan kamar mandi yang langsung tersumbat. Lihat foto terlampir dari penyumbatan tersebut. 5. Biaya cucian ditagih hampir 4 kali lipat dari penggunaan aktual saya, tampaknya itu tagihan orang lain. Setelah saya sampaikan, biayanya diperbaiki. 6. Hanya segelintir staf yang ramah, sementara yang lain memperlakukan saya dengan kurang ramah dibandingkan tamu Barat, semacam perasaan tersembunyi yang seharusnya tidak ada. Saya harap Wyndham Panbil Batam memperbaiki kekurangan mendasar ini dalam hal kebersihan dan komunikasi yang jelas sebelum rekan-rekan wisatawan saya memesan di sini."
"532.","Warren Bill","14","2025-01-14","1","Kamarnya bagus tetapi pelayanannya sangat buruk. Makanan untuk layanan kamar juga sangat mahal. Kami memesan layanan kamar dan makanan tidak datang selama lebih dari 30 menit, jadi saya harus memesan pengiriman makanan. Pengemudi tidak dapat menggunakan sepeda motornya untuk naik ke lobi, ia harus berjalan ke lobi dan turun lagi. Sangat merepotkan. Sarapannya lumayan tetapi tidak begitu baik untuk hotel dengan hampir 5 bintang. Telepon yang disediakan sangat rumit dengan begitu banyak tombol sehingga sebagian besar tidak berfungsi. Pancuran di kamar mandi sangat licin, orang tua bisa jatuh di kamar mandi. Lift harus ditekan dengan kuat bahkan untuk naik atau turun. Tidak ada AC di lift. Lift tampak tua. Lokasinya buruk, hotel ini dikelilingi oleh hutan dan jauh dari tempat mana pun. Tidak ada botol air yang disediakan hanya dispenser air yang ditutupi kain hitam. Saya agak khawatir apakah air di dispenser itu aman untuk diminum atau berjamur. Jalan menuju pusat kebugaran sangat menyeramkan dan remang-remang. Salah satu hotel terburuk yang pernah saya kunjungi dan saya tidak akan menginap di sini lagi."

Saya juga sangat tidak beruntung menginap di hotel ini. Kamar-kamarnya sangat standar untuk hotel bintang 5, dan pelayanannya sangat buruk. Semua makanan yang saya pesan tidak tersedia, dan restoran-restoran tidak buka sesuai jadwal. Manajemen dan staf hotel ini sangat membutuhkan pelatihan tentang cara mengelola dan bekerja di hotel. Saya baru menginap semalam dari 10 malam, tetapi akan mengajukan keluhan dan check-out lebih awal. Saran saya untuk Anda yang membaca ini? Jangan pesan!!!"

Saya makan dua, dan mereka datang dan berkata dengan nada samar, Saya sudah punya info. Dua suap harganya RM32. Setidaknya mereka seharusnya menuliskan harga atau semacamnya untuk memberi tahu saya sebelumnya. Mereka tidak melakukannya, tapi saya yakin mereka menggunakan taktik ini untuk menipu orang. Kami memesan kamar, tetapi ketika kami sampai di sana, mereka bilang tidak ada kamar. Saya yakin mereka menggunakan taktik ini untuk menipu orang. Mereka bilang tidak ada kamar. Alasan mereka adalah kemarin banyak orang. Banyak orang check out jam 12 siang, jadi mereka membereskannya. Saya check in sekitar jam 6 sore, dan mereka bilang tidak ada kamar. Pijat itu seharusnya menjadi layanan khusus, plus deposit, dan harganya 520. Benar-benar 520, tetapi kamar lainnya semuanya 250. Lucu sekali."
"536.","mugdha M","80","2024-01-14","1","Jendela kamar berdebu. Pelayanan di kamar di bawah rata-rata. Kami harus menelepon berkali-kali untuk memesan makanan dan layanan kamar lainnya. Bahkan setelah memberikan detail kartu kredit, mereka selalu meminta kami melunasi tagihan makanan setiap kali kami memesan. Stafnya sangat canggung. Kami juga mengalami pengalaman yang tidak menyenangkan dengan salah satu restoran sarapan. Mereka tidak memberikan informasi tentang biaya per orang, dan manajer restoran terus mengganggu kami saat kami sedang makan, bahkan setelah kami menyetujui perubahan apa pun. Semuanya berakhir baik karena manajer hotel bersikap sopan dan profesional. Sayangnya, pengalaman menginap kami di sini kurang menyenangkan. Ini adalah kedua kalinya kami menginap di hotel ini setelah di Jakarta. Sayangnya, kami akan menghindari hotel ini lagi lain kali."

Kami memesan kamar bebas rokok. Kami sudah meminta untuk pindah kamar. Kamar kedua baik-baik saja, tidak ada bau aneh, tetapi sumbat wastafel dasar macet, brankas tidak berfungsi, ada rambut di seprai, kursi kotor, handuk kotor, dan 3/4 stopkontak tidak berfungsi. Mereka berhasil memperbaiki masalahnya, kecuali stopkontak di samping tempat tidur. Keluarga saya membutuhkan catu daya untuk mesin oksigen tidur, dan karena stopkontaknya rusak, ia tidak dapat menggunakan mesin dan tidak bisa tidur semalaman.

"541.","Moon","5","2023-01-14","1","Pelayanannya sangat buruk dibandingkan sebelum pandemi. Saya selalu menginap di hotel ini setiap kali ke Batam, sekitar 4-5 kali setahun. Ini hotel bintang 5. Saya selalu menginap di kamar suite. Sebelumnya, ada high tea gratis setiap hari selama kami menginap, dan petugas hubungan tamu akan mengetuk pintu kami untuk mengatakan bahwa ia akan mengurus kami selama menginap di sini. Kami merasa sangat nyaman. Setelah itu, tidak ada lagi petugas hubungan tamu, dan high tea gratis hanya tersedia untuk satu hari selama kami menginap. Sekarang, tidak ada lagi high tea gratis untuk kami. Tapi tidak apa-apa, kami ingin memesan dan membayar high tea kami, tetapi pengalaman buruk menanti kami. Kami pergi ke bar di lantai 15 untuk menanyakannya, dan diberi tahu bahwa high tea akan dikenakan biaya Rp150.000 di Kayu Manis Bar. Keesokan harinya, kami menghubungi Premier Assistance untuk mengonfirmasi ulang bahwa high tea akan tersedia di Kayu Manis Bar dan diberi tahu bahwa mereka setuju. Ketika kami turun ke bar, petugasnya bilang tidak ada high tea. Kami pergi ke resepsionis untuk bertanya, dan stafnya juga memberi tahu kami bahwa tidak ada high tea. Ketika kami terus bertanya (karena kami diberitahu oleh staf di lantai 15 dan juga staf asisten premier bahwa ada), staf Fitri menelepon restoran. Setelah itu, dia meminta maaf karena memberikan informasi yang salah ketika kami menelepon asisten premier (dialah staf yang menjawab panggilan), dan dia pikir kami mengacu pada high tea GRATIS. Jadi, selama kami berbicara dengannya, di depannya selama 10 menit terakhir, dia pikir kami meminta high tea GRATIS?! Padahal saya sudah bilang staf lantai 15 bilang harganya Rp150.000! Kami merasa terhina! Dia pikir kami orang pelit yang ngotot minta makanan gratis?! Jadi akhirnya kami memesan high tea, dan coba tebak? Kami menunggu 1,5 jam sampai pesanannya datang! Perlu saya ingatkan, ini adalah hotel bintang 5. Selain itu, sarapan prasmanannya sekarang sangat terbatas. Sebelumnya, menunya fantastis. Sekarang, rasanya semakin buruk, sungguh menyedihkan. Hotel bintang 5 dengan menu sarapan bintang 3. Dan restoran utamanya sekarang hanya menyajikan makanan Cina. Kami tidak pergi ke Batam untuk mencari makanan Cina. Makanannya tidak fantastis, udangnya juga tidak segar. Variasinya juga sangat terbatas. Dan kami diberitahu bahwa kami harus pergi ke bar Kayu Manis jika ingin memesan makanan Barat. Tapi tidak ada meja makan yang layak di bar itu! Dan setiap kali kami memesan sesuatu, kami harus menunggu sekitar 40 menit hingga 1 jam (atau lebih) hingga makanannya tiba. Secara keseluruhan, saya sangat kecewa dengan hotel ini sekarang. Sebelumnya, saya sangat puas dengan hotel ini setiap kali saya datang ke Batam karena membuat saya merasa sangat diterima. Sekarang saya harus memberi kesempatan pada hotel lain. Tidak ada yang mengecewakan! Tidak direkomendasikan kecuali Anda bersedia membayar harga bintang 5 untuk layanan dan makanan bintang 3."

Itu jelas penipuan karena mereka memiliki hotel bintang 1 lain di dekatnya untuk menampung kami semua, BAHKAN TANPA BIAYA TAMBAHAN. Bahkan jika kami pindah ke hotel bintang 1, mereka tidak akan mengembalikan selisih harga. Eksterior dan kebaruan hotel mungkin membuat Anda ragu pada awalnya, tetapi dengan cara mereka menjalankan bisnis, saya tidak akan pernah menginap di hotel ini atau hotel afiliasi lainnya."

"609.","Ernst Hemmer","128","2025-07-14","2","Wyndham yang Mengecewakan. Kami menginap di Wyndham Panbil Batam ini, yang dulunya merupakan hotel Best Western, dari tanggal 7 hingga 11 Juni 2025. Kami memesan kamar dengan ekspektasi tinggi, tetapi pulang dengan kekecewaan. Sisi positifnya, hotel ini tampak bagus, memiliki suasana bintang 5, kamar-kamar luas berperabot lengkap, dan pemandangan danau yang indah (jika Anda memesan kamar di sisi danau, seperti yang kami lakukan). Minibar gratis sangat dihargai, sentuhan yang menyenangkan. Bar di atapnya nyaman dengan pemandangan fantastis, menu yang beragam, kualitas makanan yang jauh lebih baik daripada yang disajikan di restoran utama di lantai dasar, dan layanan yang jauh lebih baik. Kami menikmati layanan profesional dari Bapak Redho. Namun, di sisi negatifnya, ada beberapa kekecewaan yang memengaruhi pengalaman kami. Saat mendekati pintu masuk hotel, tercium bau menyengat seperti selokan, tepat di luar pintu masuk. Hal ini terasa sangat tidak nyaman. Mungkin kesalahan lokasi arsitektur. Selama kami menginap, ada rombongan tamu di hotel, yang membuatnya sangat ramai, terutama saat jam makan. Hanya ada 3 lift di lobi, yang tidak memadai untuk gedung sebesar ini. Ini juga merupakan kelalaian arsitektur. Antrean mengular di depan lift setiap pagi, dan seringkali butuh 10 menit untuk naik atau turun. Kekecewaan utama adalah restoran Andaliman di lantai dasar, yang tampaknya telah diperluas melintasi lobi untuk mengakomodasi rombongan. Kualitas makanan di sini sangat buruk, kebanyakan terlalu matang, dan sama saja setiap hari, baik saat sarapan maupun makan siang. Kopi tidak mungkin didapatkan saat sarapan, karena mesinnya terus-menerus rusak. Peralatannya pun buruk. Akhirnya kami memesan kopi dari bar lobi, dengan biaya tambahan, hanya untuk menikmati kopi sarapan. Restoran itu tampak sangat kekurangan staf, stafnya pelupa (tidak ingat kami meminta sesuatu), dan tampak tidak puas dengan pekerjaan mereka. Layanan kebersihan juga tampaknya kekurangan staf, karena kamar kami hanya bisa dibersihkan pada sore hari. Di dalam kamar sendiri, kejutan besar adalah pancuran yang kurang nyaman. Kabin pancuran dilengkapi pancuran atas yang menempel di dinding, tetapi tidak ada pancuran genggam. Sebagai gantinya, terdapat keran rendah yang terpasang, yang tidak kami gunakan. Oleh karena itu, mandi menjadi hal yang menantang, karena Anda terpaksa mencuci rambut setiap kali masuk ke pancuran, karena yang ada hanyalah pancuran kepala! Ini adalah sesuatu yang belum pernah kami alami sebelumnya di hotel-hotel di Asia mana pun, di mana semua kamar mandi hotel setidaknya dilengkapi pancuran genggam/badan. Jadi, hanya untuk pengalaman mandi saja, kami sarankan untuk menghindari hotel ini. Terakhir, fasilitas yang disediakan di kamar mandi sangat kurang, atau setidaknya tidak diisi ulang saat kami check-in, sehingga kami harus meminta sabun dan tisu toilet, yang diberikan dengan enggan, hanya setelah kami mengeluhkannya dua kali. Biaya untuk 2 botol air, yang diletakkan di sebelah mesin kopi, terasa hampir tidak masuk akal. Mengapa menaruh 2 botol air di sana dengan biaya tertentu, sementara sudah ada tangki air minum yang disediakan? Ini sama sekali tidak masuk akal. Jelas, kami tidak menyentuh kedua botol itu. Secara keseluruhan, pengalaman menginap di Wyndham cukup mengecewakan, karena hotel ini jauh dari hotel bintang 5 yang dipromosikan di situs pemesanan. Kami tidak akan kembali lagi ke properti ini. Perawatan hotel kurang, staf perlu dilatih cara bekerja dengan senang hati kepada tamu (diperlukan pelatihan pemberian layanan), dan restoran utama membutuhkan koki profesional untuk menyiapkan makanan yang lebih baik. Secara umum, manajemen hotel Wyndham perlu ditingkatkan."
"610.","M_T “Marg”","253","2025-08-14","2","Menginap satu malam di apartemen yang baru dibuka ini dan kecewa — AC tidak berfungsi dengan baik dan mengeluarkan suara keras sepanjang malam, sehingga sulit beristirahat."

Dagingnya benar-benar gosong, bagian dalam omeletnya kurang matang, ???"
"613.","wandachan1417","35","2025-01-14","2","Menginap di 1008. Sama sekali tidak menikmati masa inap saya. Kecewa saat saya masuk karena tidak ada wastafel ganda seperti gambar yang diiklankan. Hanya dilengkapi dengan 1 wastafel. Ketinggian wastafel sangat buruk sehingga saya dan pasangan saya merasa sakit punggung setelah menggunakannya. Terlalu rendah. Wastafel juga memiliki kontrol yang aneh. Itu adalah kenop putar yang tidak menunjukkan untuk memutar ke atas atau ke bawah. Setelah berhari-hari menggunakan. Kami masih tidak ingat. Saluran pembuangan bak mandi dan saluran pembuangan di sebelah mangkuk toilet juga lambat dan tersumbat. Air butuh waktu lama untuk dikeringkan. Tempat tidurnya oke tetapi suhu AC tidak dapat disesuaikan. Apa pun yang kami lakukan, tetap sama. Sarapannya lumayan, namun, termos airnya sangat menakutkan. Airnya datang dengan banyak partikel hitam kecil. Saya mencoba beberapa cangkir, semuanya datang dengan partikel hitam. Meja dapur dipenuhi dengan cangkir-cangkir kosong dengan benda-benda hitam itu. Tekanan pancuran hujan juga tidak fantastis. Harus memasang kepala pancuran genggam di sana juga. Karena tekanan air dari pancuran hujan buruk. Sandal kamar tidur kualitasnya buruk, sangat tipis. Pintu toilet (keduanya) berlubang. AC, bau, dan suara semuanya bisa lolos. Meskipun kamar dilengkapi dengan satu galon air besar, tetapi tidak disegel, kita tidak akan pernah tahu apakah kamarnya baru/bersih. Tidak ada tisu toilet tambahan. Harus menelepon untuk meminta tambahan. Tidak akan menginap di hotel ini lagi."
"614.","Faye T.","51","2023-01-14","2","Stafnya ramah dan baik. Menginap di kamar eksekutif - besar dan nyaman. Tempat tidurnya lumayan, menurut saya agak empuk. Bantalnya nyaman. Kamar mandinya besar dan dilengkapi bathtub besar, yang sangat bagus. Jubah mandinya sangat nyaman. Ada juga mesin kopi di dalam kamar. Kekurangan kamar - redup, berdebu, agak pengap (ventilasi tidak berfungsi dengan baik), dan colokan listriknya tidak berfungsi. Sarapannya cukup banyak di L1, tapi agak asin menurut saya. Lounge eksekutif nyaman, dengan area yang lebih kecil dengan pemandangan danau yang indah di L15. Agak mengecewakan mengetahui bahwa merokok di dalam ruangan diperbolehkan di lounge eksekutif. (Mereka memberi tahu kami bahwa mereka memasang kipas angin di sudut ruangan untuk mengusir asap. Kami kurang puas dengan penjelasan itu, cukup yakin bukan begitu cara kerjanya). Orang tua dengan anak kecil, atau individu dengan masalah pernapasan mungkin perlu memperhatikan hal ini. Musik live band di lobi malam itu keras sekali (suaranya memekakkan telinga), jadi kami pergi ke bar atap untuk minum-minum, tetapi ditolak karena mereka hanya menyajikan menu set. Suasananya nyaman, dan akan menyenangkan untuk makan malam jika kami punya waktu. Secara keseluruhan, pengalaman menginapnya lumayan, cukup jauh dari keramaian. Sayangnya kami tidak menikmati waktu kami di hotel ini. Dengan harga segitu, saya tidak merekomendasikannya."
"615.","Aprillia Cindy Damian","20","2023-01-14","2","Suami saya dan saya datang ke Batam untuk liburan singkat akhir pekan, dan ini adalah perjalanan pertama kami bersama sejak pandemi melanda. Sebelumnya, kami menginap di hotel bintang 4 di dekat pusat kota, tetapi kali ini kami memutuskan untuk menjauh dari keramaian kota. Oleh karena itu, kami memilih Best Western Premier Pandil karena terlihat menjanjikan dari foto dan ulasan Google. Hari ke-1, check-in, resepsionis ramah, dan minuman selamat datang gratis. Kami tiba lebih awal dari waktu check-in normal, tetapi untungnya ada kamar yang tersedia sehingga mereka mengizinkan kami check-in. Kami mendapatkan kupon untuk minuman selamat datang dan camilan di bar di sebelah meja resepsionis. Kami pergi ke bar dan menunggu sekitar 15 menit. Tidak ada pelayan di sana, lalu kami bertanya kepada resepsionis dan menunggu 10 menit lagi hingga kami dapat memesan minuman. Masuk ke kamar, pemandangannya sangat indah karena kami bisa melihat danau yang indah dikelilingi pepohonan hijau. Selanjutnya, kami menemukan tamu tak terduga, yaitu seekor kecoa di lantai. Kamarnya sama sekali tidak higienis karena kami melihat begitu banyak debu di lantai dan permukaan. Izinkan saya memberi tahu Anda bahwa hotel ini berperingkat bintang 5. Hari ke-2, kami turun untuk sarapan prasmanan sekitar pukul 09.15. Kami terkejut melihat restoran tampak berantakan karena banyak piring kotor yang tidak dicuci, piring-piring kosong, dan ketika kami bertanya apakah ada isi ulang untuk beberapa hidangan, jawabannya tidak. Jusnya tidak dingin, dan stasiun telur tidak menyediakan topping untuk omelet Anda. Izinkan saya memberi tahu Anda bahwa hotel ini berperingkat bintang 5. Selanjutnya, kami turun ke kolam renang, kolam renang tanpa batas yang cukup bagus dengan pemandangan danau. Kami haus karena cuacanya cukup bagus dan cerah, ingin memesan minuman. Tidak ada seorang pun di konter handuk. Ada instruksi untuk menghubungi nomor dan memesan langsung dari restoran. Kami menelepon, terhubung ke operator, lalu wanita itu berkata tunggu sebentar sambil diantar ke restoran. Menunggu selama 10 menit dan tidak ada jawaban. Akhirnya seorang pria muncul di konter, jadi kami memesan jus dan soda dan kami menunggu sekitar 30 menit. Masih belum ada tanda untuk minuman kami. Perlu saya beri tahu, hotel ini berperingkat bintang 5. Kami masih punya satu malam lagi untuk dihabiskan dan menikmati spa. Semoga saja, kondisinya akan membaik. Kesimpulannya, jangan menginap di hotel ini jika Anda mengharapkan kualitas dan layanan bintang 5. Hotel-hotel bintang 4 itu, sejujurnya, SANGAT BERHARGA. Bisa berlibur saja sudah merupakan kemewahan, dan Best Western Premier Batam ini benar-benar terlalu dibesar-besarkan, dan seharusnya hanya diberi peringkat bintang 3,5 saja, seperti hotel-hotel Best Western lain yang saya ketahui di dunia."

Teko kopinya tidak berfungsi, dan air tidak mengalir keluar dari bilik pancuran (kamar kedua). Manajer datang dan memberi saya kamar yang lebih bagus.

Saya menitipkan cucian saya, dan baru diantar dua hari kemudian, dan saya harus mencari pakaian sendiri. Cuciannya tidak bersih, meninggalkan kotoran. Seprai sudah diganti, tetapi ada noda hitam. Kamar mandinya dingin di pagi hari. Panas di malam hari, tetapi setelah 5-7 menit semakin dingin, seolah-olah air panasnya ada batasnya. Teman-teman meminta sabun mandi cair, tetapi mereka menunggu lebih dari satu jam. Satu-satunya kelebihannya adalah sarapannya. Sedih..."
"618.","Brutal & Honest Reviewer","426","2019-01-14","2","Dekorasi hotelnya bagus, tetapi air di kamar mandinya dingin atau suam-suam kuku hampir sepanjang waktu. Terletak di antah berantah, Anda harus bergantung pada layanan antar-jemput hotel untuk mencapai Nagoya Hills atau Megamall. Tidak ada toko di dekatnya. Restoran Korea di dalam hotel enak. Sarapannya biasa saja. Area ini memiliki banyak orang Korea, mulai dari tamu hotel hingga tamu yang menginap di apartemen berlayanan jangka panjang. Sekelompok turis Korea yang berisik membuat banyak suara keras di tengah malam di lorong, berbicara keras, membanting pintu, dan saling mengetuk pintu kamar. Intinya, mereka melampiaskan perilaku kasar mereka di mana-mana. Saya tidak akan kembali ke sini lagi, Radisson di dekatnya adalah pilihan yang jauh lebih baik."

Manajer hotel tidak mengerti cara mengelola hotel untuk tamu VIP, Platinum, atau tamu lain yang sering menginap. Staf telah dilatih untuk berpikir bahwa jam koktail pukul 17.00 hingga 18.00 di lounge eksekutif adalah waktu penggunaan voucher minuman selamat datang untuk hotel. Ini benar-benar konyol/gila. 1) Lounge Klub Eksekutif tutup total selama saya menginap 2) tidak ada voucher minuman selamat datang yang diberikan saat check-in 3) surat yang menyatakan hak istimewa saya tertinggal di kamar, tetapi hak istimewa ini sebenarnya tidak ada di properti ini! 4) Saya minum beberapa gelas antara pukul 17.00 dan 18.00 pada tanggal saya menginap, manajemen menolak untuk memberikan kompensasi meskipun jelas ada fasilitas untuk menginap tersebut Sebagai seseorang yang menginap di hotel sekitar 200 hari setahun (untuk bekerja), Accor Platinum, IHG Royal Ambassador Spire Élite, Marriott Bonvoy Lifetime Platinum, hotel ini sungguh tidak dapat dibandingkan. Menunggu Marriott Harbour Center Batam buka - barulah saya bisa puas dengan kamar-kamar kumuh di bawah standar seperti ini. Kelebihan: stafnya ramah dan tidak selalu meminta tip, lokasinya cukup sentral dan tidak pernah mengalami kemacetan lalu lintas yang parah saat berangkat maupun tiba. Kekurangan: manajemennya buruk, beberapa bagian hotel jelas perlu diperbaiki/diperbarui seperti jamur di kamar mandi, pintu kamar mandi rusak, minibar sungguhan (minibar gratis hanya berisi beberapa kaleng soda, air, dan biskuit, itu cuma lelucon). Secara keseluruhan, saya rasa saya tidak akan pernah bisa menginap di properti ini lagi - ini sama sekali tidak sesuai dengan namanya, Bear Western Premier. Paling banter Best Western."
