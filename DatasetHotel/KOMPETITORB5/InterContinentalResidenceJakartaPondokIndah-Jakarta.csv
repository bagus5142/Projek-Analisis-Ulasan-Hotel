Felicia & Jovand prepared our seamless check in and though its peak period, our waiting time for rooms are reduce and we were also having our lunch when they informed our rooms are ready. I am not sure other hotels “lent” us their wheelchairs for 3days 2nights subject to availability but so far only, Intercontinental hotel provide us with their service! Excellent! Our rooms are spacious, very clean and hygienic! The bell boy brought our luggages and when we checked out, they helped to wrap and tie my parent’s faulty luggage! This is truly amazing for going way beyond their customer service! The hotel is connected to malls. So enjoy yourself! Breakfast is good too! Lots of varieties and spoilt for choices! Will definitely return! Thank you!"

From the moment I arrived, the staff made me feel genuinely welcomed with their warm hospitality and efficient service. Check-in was smooth and professional, and I appreciated how the team took the time to explain the hotel facilities and ensure all my requests were met. The room was spacious, beautifully designed, and exceptionally clean. I loved the comfortable bed, high-quality linens, and thoughtful touches that made the stay feel luxurious. The panoramic city views added an extra sense of relaxation, especially at night. The bathroom was well-equipped with premium amenities, and the attention to detail truly stood out. The breakfast buffet was another highlight, an impressive selection of local and international dishes, all fresh and delicious. The staff at the restaurant were attentive without being intrusive, and they consistently ensured that guests were well taken care of. The hotel’s facilities were well-maintained and inviting. It’s clear that the team takes pride in providing an exceptional guest experience. Overall, Intercontinental Jakarta offers outstanding comfort, top-tier service, and excellent value. I would happily stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone visiting the city."

The masseuse was very good, always making sure i was comfortable every step of the way. The smell of the room was aromatic and the atmosphere was quiet with some light background music. And the fact that each private room comes with a clean toilet as well makes it very convenient. Thank you!"
"4.","Don Realdy","222","2025-12-11","5","An Exceptional Birthday Experience We had one of the most memorable birthday celebrations for my son during our stay. Everything—from the room preparation to the arrangement at Sugar & Spice—was handled with outstanding care and attention to detail. The team truly went above and beyond to make the day feel special, and we could feel the warmth in every gesture. Thank you to the entire staff for your professionalism, hospitality, and excellent service. We sincerely appreciate the effort that was put into making this celebration unforgettable. We would be delighted to return for our future stays and any upcoming special occasions. Highly recommended."
"5.","Kevin Park","16","2025-12-01","5","During check-in, thanks to the thoughtful assistance of Erico, I was delighted to be assigned to a lovely room. Although there were a few issues during my stay, Riki, the Duty Manager, handled them with remarkable professionalism and care, ensuring a truly comfortable experience. At check-out, Olivia, the Supervisor, made my day with her warm gesture and thoughtful souvenir — a beautiful way to end my stay. There can always be occasional issues in any hotel; what truly distinguishes a world-class property from an ordinary one is how the team responds. In that regard, every member of the staff I encountered demonstrated exemplary service, genuine attentiveness, and sincere hospitality. Among all the InterContinental properties I’ve stayed at, this one truly stands out as the best in terms of staff excellence and responsiveness. That said, I believe the management may wish to consider some maintenance and partial renovation to bring the facilities in line with the outstanding quality of the service. Nevertheless, my overall stay was wonderful, and I remain deeply grateful to all the staff for their kindness and dedication. I will most certainly return to this property on my next visit to Jakarta."
"6.","A K","9","2025-12-25","5","Amazing stay at InterContinental Jakarta. Warm welcome from Mr. Teja, Mr. Edy, Mr. Triadi, Ms. Venny, Olivia, and the team. The room had a beautiful view, the Club Lounge was excellent, and breakfast service by Mr. Kurniawan was outstanding. Loved the thoughtful dessert from the chef—it truly touched my heart. Highly recommended! Will definitely return for a longer stay."
"7.","Amalia Suzianti","9","2025-12-01","5","As an IHG member, I truly felt honored and cared for during my staycation at InterContinental Jakarta Pondok Indah. This hotel always feels like a second home — it wasn’t my first visit, and it definitely won’t be the last. Every detail, from the warm hospitality to the thoughtful service, made our stay so special. The breakfast was amazing, the spa experience (I took the Kerokan Javanese Massage with Mini Facial) was deeply relaxing, and the steam and Finnish sauna were just perfect. The gym and our special celebration made the whole stay even more memorable. Thank you, InterContinental team, for another wonderful experience! 💛"
"8.","Erin Septiyana","5","2025-10-01","5","From check in to check out, the entire service was truly satisfying. I also received a wonderful surprise on my birthday. The breakfast offered a wide variety of menu choices. The gym area was fully equipped, and I received excellent service from Mr. Teguh, the gym attendant, who kindly lent me shoes, guided me on how to use the equipment, and shared many of his work experiences. The service here feels very warm and friendly, just like being with our own friends. Overall, the service at InterContinental Jakarta Pondok Indah felt not only professional but also genuinely friendly like being welcomed by close friends. As a guest, I am delighted to share this highly positive experience. Without a doubt, it deserves a perfect ten out of ten."

"11.","Anna Palmer","49","2025-10-01","5","I gave all 5 stars, even for the location, because for us it was exactly where we needed to be not in the center, but in the right area. We were privileged to stay in the Club Room, and it was absolutely awesome. The hotel is new, and the rooms are impeccable. We really appreciated the club facilities and service. the Club team was so professional and making sure about our stay to go smoothly and relaxed. Erico, particularly was the one that we would like to appreciate. Breakfast was very good, keep in mind it’s Asian-style, which we personally love. I can understand that for some guests it may not suit their taste, but we enjoyed it. The location is excellent, right between three malls, so if the hotel restaurant food isn’t your preference, you can easily walk to the malls and explore many dining options. The spa was a wonderful experience: very professional, with great service and attention to detail. The Japanese restaurant in the hotel also has a creative menu with interesting dishes, not the typical “foreigner-oriented” options, but authentic and flavorful. Overall, it was a very good stay. Highly recommended!"

The hotel is beautifully connected to Pondok Indah Mall, which made everything so convenient. The room was spacious, clean, and modern, with great city views and a very comfortable bed. The bathroom felt luxurious — I especially appreciated the separate shower and bathtub. Breakfast at Sugar & Spice was a highlight, with an incredible variety of international and local dishes.

"25.","Sasha Nugraha","5","2025-12-01","5","My 4th time staying at Intercontinental. Had issues during check in, handled perfectly by the manager Mr. Harris. Since it was my birthday, the staff sent a complimentary birthday cake with polaroid pictures. They also gave my children some drawing kit. Overall I always love staying here.

"26.","Jessica Chandra","9","2025-10-01","5","Had such a great time at the pool during my stay at InterContinental Pondok Indah. The pool area is super clean, relaxing, and just a really nice spot to unwind. Plenty of loungers, nice vibes, and great for both swimming or just chilling by the water. Big shoutout to Rizal from the pool staff — he was really attentive and friendly the whole time. Always checked in to see if I needed anything and made sure everyone was comfortable. Really appreciated his hospitality!"
"27.","travel family","2","2025-09-01","4","Stayed at the Intercontinental in Jakarta recently and honestly the staff were amazing. Super friendly, really accommodating and even upgraded all 3 of our rooms without any hassle. They looked after us really well. The breakfast was fantastic – loads of choice and everything was fresh and tasty. Definitely one of the highlights of the stay. Only downside is the location. The hotel itself is great, but it’s pretty isolated. If you want to grab a quick drink or get into the busier parts of the city, it takes a while. Overall – great service, great food, not the best spot if you want easy access to things."
"28.","Addisya Safinatu","5","2025-10-01","5","I had a wonderful experience at this swimming pool. The water was clean, well-maintained, and at a comfortable temperature, which made swimming very enjoyable. The facilities were modern and spacious, with plenty of seating areas for relaxation.

"38.","elouise mahalia","5","2025-12-01","3","Halo, saya ingin menyampaikan masukan. Musik di lounge terlalu keras, sehingga cukup sulit untuk berbicara atau mengadakan meeting dengan nyaman.

As someone who enjoys visiting Pondok Indah Mall, this hotel was the perfect choice.

From entering greeted by a couple of people to very smooth check in, by miss Olivia. She was super sweet and lovely. Including waiting at the lobby with welcome drinks was really nice with many selections (super rare in hotel) and orange apple juice kept me feel relax while waiting for the room. Room was super clean and smells amazing. The whole hotel smells amazing. Sadly it was raining we didn’t get to use the pool as it was closed. Breakfast spread was so amazing including the guys who always offering help and asking do u need anything all the times. There sandwich station including eggs Benedict and jamu and a whole slab of honey… loved it We frequent at Shangri La, but this service comes out way better. Thank you guys for such pleasurable stay."
"49.","Ngadino","3","2025-12-01","2","Saya membeli black forest di Cake Shop untuk ulang tahun teman saya. Namun membutuhkan yang terlalu menurut saya, dan tidak masuk akal. Apalagi ketika cake yang dibeli harganya hampir 1 juta di hotel bintang 5. Saya sangat kecewa karena yang tadinya mau memberikan kejutan meriah jadi tidak dapat terlaksana dengan baik."
"50.","Cheryl Warrington","5","2025-11-01","5","I very much enjoyed my recent stay at the Intercontinental Hotel in Jakarta. My room was great and the hotel staff professional and helpful. I particularly enjoyed using the hotel pool, both as a hotel guest and then using ClassPass.

"51.","Evy Purnomo","1","2025-12-25","5","Tempat istirahat yg nyaman di tengah hiruk pikuk jakarta,mewah,makanan enak, pelayanan memuaskan,kolam renang luas serta fasilitas yg lumayan lengkap"
"52.","Shravan Kumar","115","2025-10-01","3","My family and I are currently staying at the Intercontinental Residence for a month, occupying two rooms at the end of the corridor that face each other. We are very pleased with the layout — the rooms are spacious, well-equipped with kitchenettes, and offer all the amenities needed to comfortably settle in, especially for families like ours who are new to Jakarta. However, I would like to raise a concern regarding the parking system. I was informed that each room is entitled to one complimentary parking spot in B1. Unfortunately, due to what appears to be a system fault, our car continues to be charged each time it exits the premises. This has resulted in unknown deductions from our e-money toll card. Our driver reached out to the front desk for assistance — either for a refund or a top-up — but was not provided with any support. While this may seem like a minor issue, it has become a recurring inconvenience and a source of unnecessary frustration during an otherwise comfortable stay. I hope this matter can be looked into and resolved promptly, as we still have some time left in our stay and would appreciate a seamless parking experience moving forward."

"63.","Chico Affandi","3","2025-07-01","5","I recently visited Sugar & Spice at InterContinental Jakarta Pondok Indah for lunch, and the experience was truly delightful. Although I wasn’t staying at the hotel, the warm welcome and polished service made me feel like a valued guest from the moment I arrived. The restaurant’s vibrant layout—with its open kitchens and global culinary stations—created an inviting atmosphere. I was especially drawn to the Indian food section, which I tried first. The aromas were rich and comforting, and the flavors reflected a clear attention to authenticity, even if I can’t recall the exact dishes I sampled. What impressed me most was the attentiveness of the staff. Even something as simple as refilling the complimentary water was done promptly and with a smile—no need to ask or wait. That level of service added a layer of ease and enjoyment to the meal. Sugar & Spice offers more than just variety—it delivers a thoughtful dining experience that blends international flavors with genuine hospitality. I’d gladly return for another lunch, and next time, I might just stay a little longer."

When they knew that my gf birthday was during the stay, we received 2! birthday cakes during the actual day. Room was big and clean. Booked the King premium room with a bathtub and king size bed. There is a nespresso machine and daily top up of capsules and TWG teabags. Our TV decided to misbehave 1 evening and the workers actually took time to troubleshoot and change the TV on the spot. Amenities wise, there is a swimming pool, fully equipped gym (including movement studio for yoga) and an in-house SPA that customers can enjoy. The Sugar & Spice restaurant provided daily meal (breakfast, lunch and dinner) and also a private Japanese Teppanyaki restaurant which is helmed by a very experienced Japanese chef. There are a lot of cultural variety food to choose from which is great and spoilt for choice. The hotel is right at the center of the 3 malls (Pondok Indah Mall 1,2 and 3). There is direct access from hotel to PIM2 which also provides access to PIM1 and PIM3. In my opinion, the staff’s friendliness and services alone make this the best hotel in Jakarta. Would make it a point to stay here annually just to chill and relax."

The room was spacious, clean, and very comfortable—perfect for both rest and work. The overall atmosphere of the hotel was calm, tidy, and well-maintained, creating a relaxing environment throughout my stay. One of the standout aspects was the friendliness of the staff. From check-in to check-out, everyone was courteous, helpful, and always ready to assist with a smile. The food was also a highlight—delicious, well-prepared, and with a good variety to choose from. If I had to mention one drawback, it would be the breakfast area. While the food was great, the space felt a bit cramped, with tables placed quite close to each other. This reduced the sense of privacy for guests during breakfast. Overall, a great hotel experience, and I would definitely return."

They offer a wide range of treatments, and the massage therapists are very skilled. I often have sore muscles from exercises, and the deep tissue massage with Puput was especially amazing—just what I needed. Afterwards, I enjoyed the steam, sauna, and hot/cold plunge, leaving me completely relaxed and refreshed."

"160.","dr. Tiffany Alborés","4","2025-10-01","5","I’ve been a member of Inaria Spa since March 2025. At first I was interested with the location that is very close to my house, but then immediately fell in love with the hotel facilities including the Sugar & Spice buffet , Chinese food at the Palace with amazing city view, and the live music at the lobby lounge. The staffs are very friendly, helpful, and always full of smile. Also it’s connected to my go to mall (PIM 1-2-3-SG) & golf course. My life can’t be more complete than this.💛 My review for the spa itself, I must say it’s one of the most modern spa facilities in Jakarta. It’s very complete, from different types of massages using Indonesian herbs, very professional masseuses, they also provide facial service using a high end Swiss’ product (Niance) and also salon facility. Ibu Meike & Ibu Fida , who always welcome me at the spa, they are the best . Always informative with the events of the gym also. For the wellness, the newest trend it provide is cold plunge & shaved ice — best when your muscles need recovery . Can go up to 120 C if you can handle it. Most saunas in town can’t reach even 90 Celcius. The locker room is neat, clean, and very complete. Next to the locker room is a relaxing lounge with recliner chair & side lamp to assist you read your favorite book after a series of decompression sessions. Perfect way to start or even end your day. I have been to many spas in 5 star hotel in Jakarta and I must say Intercontinental Pondok Indah is my favorite! Keep up the amazing work and best of luck for the whole staffs. 🫶🏻👏🏼👍🏼"

"162.","B. W. Rans","44","2025-10-01","5","Went here for the gym via Class Pass. Gym equipments were new and well maintained. Enough free weights variation for a hotel gym: cable tower, one barbell, one smith machine, dumbbells up to 20 kg, and two benches. Various cardio and machines are also available. Water cooler, infused water, and towels are provided. My personal highlight would be the sauna, steam room, and staff friendliness. Being connected to PIM definitely puts the cherry on top. Few improvements I can think of (albeit very nitpicking): branded shower toileteries, conditioner, maybe one leg exercise equipment. All in all, a very positive experience and would definitely come back."

Out of all the hotels I’ve stayed in in Jakarta over the past few years, the entire team at the Intercon were completely faultless at every turn. Literally every staff member was kind, helpful, friendly and - highly unusual in this city - proactive, anticipating what we might want and serving us quickly and efficiently. A massive shout out the staff in the Club Lounge, especially the chefs: for me, this is the best I have experienced in Jakarta. Beautiful food, a good drinks selection and a true home from home. It links directly to PIM and you are fairly close to the tollway so if you need to stay in South Jakarta for business or just want to splurge, this is the hotel for you. Top Class!"

Every station was impressive, from the fresh seafood to the artisanal desserts, but the real showstopper was the premium Wagyu A5 with marbling score 12. Incredibly tender, rich, and buttery, it literally melted in my mouth. For the price, the quality was beyond expectations. If you're a true food lover, this kind of buffet is an absolute must try!"
"190.","Mike Dodge","116","2025-07-01","5","Potentially the best luxury hotel in Jakarta. Everything was perfect except for their “policy” about not delivering food to the rooms. It’s 50/50 where some staff will do it and some claim there’s a policy preventing them from doing it, which is obviously a lie. Just change this policy and train the staff so the hotel is the same as other luxury hotels in the city and it will be perfect."

"205.","BP","138","2025-08-01","5","A fantastic hotel in South Jakarta located next to a large mall (sub-divided into 3 sections) that caters for solo / business travelers, couples and families alike. Positives: - Impeccable service from staff - Two types of rooms (hotel and residence) with the residence rooms being spacious, and come with a kitchen, lounge room, and washing machine - 2 gyms - Large sized rectangular swimming pool - Breakfast had an adequate mix of western and Asian dishes - A number of meeting/conference rooms to cater for large scale company events Negatives: - Did not have full control of the air conditioner which would not cool the room down below 25 degrees, which meant the room was not as comfortable as it could’ve been - Car pick up service to/from the airport is too pricy at 620K IDR - The responsiveness of the lift card scanner was delayed/slow"

The room was spacious, spotless, and equipped with modern amenities. I especially loved the large windows offering stunning views of the city, particularly at night. The bed was incredibly comfortable. The breakfast buffet was another highlight. There was a wide variety of delicious options, from local Indonesian dishes to Asian and Western selections—all beautifully presented and freshly made. The restaurant staff were attentive and courteous, ensuring a pleasant dining experience. One of the biggest advantages is the direct connection to Pondok Indah Mall, which made shopping and entertainment super convenient without needing transport.

"357.","Ros Ras","35","2025-06-01","5","Our stay at the InterContinental Jakarta Pondok Indah was a truly beautiful experience. From the moment we arrived, we were surrounded by an atmosphere of quiet elegance and warmth. The hotel is tastefully decorated with stunning artifacts that reflect the richness of Indonesian heritage with a modern touch, creating a space that feels both grand and deeply welcoming. Direct access to 3 major malls is another definite plus! Our room was a highlight in itself. Beautifully modern yet incredibly cosy. The calming colour palette, soft textures and thoughtful details made it feel like a private retreat. It was the kind of space where you immediately feel at ease, able to relax and rest in true comfort. Dining at Sugar and Spice was another wonderful part of our stay. Under the leadership of Mr Kuniawan and Ms Uni Nopiani, the team delivered impeccable service with genuine hospitality. We would especially like to thank Jhon, Memey, Made, Dian and Wahyu, for their attentiveness and kindness throughout our meals. Each one of them made us feel truly cared for. We are also deeply grateful to Morenza, the girl at the glass door entrance, whose beautiful smile and gentle presence made such a lasting impression. Her warmth, grace and helpfulness are something we will always remember. A very special thank you to the young and cheerful team ; Prissy, Putri, Nabilla, Hickmal and Dmaz for the heartfelt birthday wishes. Your creativity and joyful energy made it feel all the more personal and meaningful. This birthday trip has been a deeply memorable one. We feel so blessed to have spent it in such a special place, surrounded by such kind and thoughtful people. If any names were missed, please know that every one of you contributed to the magic of our stay. Thank you to everyone at InterContinental Jakarta Pondok Indah, from the bottom of our hearts."

Had to park quite far from the hotel access. Came at 2.20PM because it is informed that check in time was at 2PM but room was not ready. The receptionist told that check in time was at 3PM. I don’t get a hotel of this class not having the room ready at check in time and having check in time information differing from that in the travel agent. No solution was offered by the hotel. Major disappointment for the price I had to pay. Had better experience in lower-rated hotels. Yikes, won’t likely to even consider this hotel ever again."

"469.","dwi hening","4","2023-01-21","1","Sayang sekali hotel sebagus dan senyaman ini harus mendapat review kurang bagus. Sedikit membagikan pengalaman saya, Tgl 071222 saya co kurang lebih pukul 07:00, sesampainya dirumah pukul 08:30 baru menyadari ada barang yg tertinggal di hotel. Dengan perasaan tenang dan berpikir positif, saya tlp pihak hotel menceritakan kejadian tsb berharap bisa di keep dahulu barangnya sampai nanti saya ambil dan pihak hotel pun merespon akan di cek terlebih dahulu. Setelah itu saya tlp kembali untuk mengkonfirmasi barang tsb, dan ternyata pihak hotel bilang “tidak ada”. Padahal saya yakin sekali barang tsb memang tertinggal di kamar, karna lupa memasukan ke dalam tas. Di jam 08:51 saya berusaha cek keberadaan barang tsb dgn mengandalkan find my device dan benar posisi barang tsb masih berada di hotel, dari pihak hotel pun bilang di jam tsb belum ada buka kamar untuk tamu selanjutnya. Lalu kemanakah barang saya?? Setelah tamu co pastinya petugas housekeeping dong ya yg masuk untuk membersihkan, apa iya tidak melihat dan menemukan barang saya? Oiya posisi hp sudah tidak aktif setelah itu. Mohon manajemen menindaklanjuti perihal case ini, kamar 1816 tgl 071222 CO pukul 07:00 siapa pertugas yg bertugas? Sayang sekali kalau harus ada oknum yang membuat rating hotel ini menjadi kurang bagus."

Jika pihak hotel setuju dengan permintaan kami kenapa saat hari H kamar bisa tidak tersedia? Sebaiknya pihak hotel komitmen atas permintaan dr costumer. Klo memang tidak bisa (saat dibooking) sebaiknya mengatakan apa adanya, jgn hanya menginginkan hotelnya dihuni."

Saya harus parkir cukup jauh dari akses hotel. Saya tiba pukul 14.20 karena diberitahu bahwa waktu check-in pukul 14.00, tetapi kamar belum siap. Resepsionis mengatakan bahwa waktu check-in adalah pukul 15.00. Saya tidak mengerti mengapa hotel kelas ini tidak menyiapkan kamar tepat waktu check-in dan informasi waktu check-in berbeda dengan yang tertera di agen perjalanan. Pihak hotel tidak menawarkan solusi apa pun. Sangat mengecewakan mengingat harga yang harus saya bayar. Saya pernah mendapatkan pengalaman yang lebih baik di hotel dengan rating lebih rendah. Aduh, saya sepertinya tidak akan mempertimbangkan hotel ini lagi."
"553.","Raissa Siswanto","6","2025-11-21","1","Sudah coba telepon resepsionis atau layanan pelanggan, tapi mereka malah bersikap seolah-olah tidak ada yang menelepon, jadi mereka tidak perlu melakukan pekerjaan mereka. Menjijikkan."

Pelayanan yang diberikan tidak sesuai dengan harga yang dikenakan. Saya harus pindah kamar 3 kali karena kebisingan jalan (lantai 19/21). Terakhir kali saya diberi tahu bahwa kamar hotel tidak tenang, jadi saya harus tidur dengan penyumbat telinga. Layanan laundry buruk, pakaian saya rusak karena suhu tinggi. Staf sudah meminta maaf, tetapi itu tidak membantu saya mengembalikan pakaian favorit saya ke bentuk semula. Saat sarapan, pilihan sayurannya sangat sedikit dan pelayannya tidak mengerti pesanan kopi saya. Saya terus-menerus diberi susu biasa ketika saya meminta susu bebas laktosa. Dan mereka selalu datang untuk menanyakan apakah saya ingin sesuatu yang lain ketika saya sedang terburu-buru menghabiskan sarapan. Selalu ada masalah dengan kamar, kualitas soket listrik sangat buruk. Saya tidak bisa mengeringkan rambut tanpa harus terus-menerus mendorong steker ke stopkontak agar tidak terlepas. Mereka juga tidak memperlakukan tamu secara setara. Saya datang bersama rekan kerja, dengan durasi menginap yang sama, dan kunjungan pertama yang sama. Saya bahkan pernah menjadi anggota jaringan hotel, tetapi mereka tidak. Rekan kerja saya yang berkulit putih mendapatkan buah dan piring cokelat setiap hari sebagai hadiah selamat datang. Bagi saya, piring buah tersebut hanya bertahan 5 detik di kamar dan langsung diambil sebelum saya memindahkan barang bawaan ke kamar. Mengingat semua pengalaman buruk yang pernah saya alami dengan hotel ini, Secara keseluruhan, itu adalah pengalaman yang menyedihkan. Saya tidak hanya tidak akan merekomendasikan hotel ini kepada siapa pun, tetapi saya juga akan memberi tahu semua teman dan rekan kerja saya untuk menjauh dari hotel ini."
"555.","Arman Furqon","20","2022-01-21","1","Layanan concierge mereka buruk. Saya menginap di sana pada November 2021. Mereka kasar dan tidak profesional. Salah satu insiden terkait pemesanan makanan dari luar, dengan kebijakan tidak mengirimkannya ke kamar hotel karena kontaminasi COVID-19. Kebijakan ini memang konyol, karena makanannya disegel. Dan yang lebih parah, saya sedang menelepon ketika makanan tiba. Setelah dengan kasar diberitahu bahwa saya harus mengambil makanan sendiri, mereka bahkan tidak repot-repot menindaklanjutinya dengan makanan. Saya sengaja menunggu, kapan mereka akan menindaklanjuti makanan tersebut? Tidak ada, sampai saya check out. Saya sudah melaporkan hal ini di TripAdvisor, dan direktur komunikasi memberikan balasan yang sangat umum dan standar (saya ragu dia yang mengirim balasan, kemungkinan besar salah satu anggota timnya). Lalu ketika saya mengirim email kepadanya, tidak ada balasan. Jadi, saya rasa, masalah ini sudah menyebar luas di seluruh organisasi."
"556.","G A 3","262","2021-01-21","1","Tidak yakin bagaimana seseorang bisa mengatakan hotel bintang 5, karena intercontinental pondok indah ini tidak memiliki seorang pun di pintu masuk lobi saat saya tiba, tidak ada Bell boy dan ketika akhirnya ada seorang pria dia tidak menawarkan untuk membantu dengan tas untuk check in. Ketika ditanya tentang valet, tampaknya hanya untuk Direktur. Hotel bintang 5 mungkin sedikit bintang 5. Bagaimanapun juga harus memarkir mobil saya di tempat parkir dan setelah memarkir mobil saya, istri saya yang menggendong bayi saya kesulitan membuka pintu dan keamanan di x-ray tidak peduli atau mencoba membantu seorang wanita dengan seorang anak untuk membuka pintu. Presidential Suite indah, tetapi kamar tidur, TV tidak BERFUNGSI. Teknisi datang mengatakan sesuatu tentang tidak ada listrik dan butuh beberapa saat untuk memperbaikinya!! Saya tidak akan menyebut ini hotel yang bagus atau hotel bintang 5, bukan?! Saya kira Intercontinental tidak melakukan pelatihan rutin atau semacamnya. Dan jika Anda akan menggunakan covid sebagai alasan, sebaiknya tutup saja sampai saat itu, jika tidak, Anda hanya akan mengecewakan pelanggan."

Saya udah buru-buru dari rumah sore-sore naik motor ngejar waktu , ditanya sama security hotel mau apa ? Mungkin karna naik motor kali yaa.. saya bilang mau nginap nunggu teman, akhirnya masuk. Tapi kok kaya curiga yaa sama saya karna naik motor hehehe .. sampai ditanya kok keluar lagi pak? Kamar nomor berapa? Emang harus tau kah security nomor kamar ? Ga jadi nginep pak? Ga sopan sih nanya gtu ke tamu.. Saya keluar masuk hotel ada aja perlu nya meeting lah, ngopi, macam2 !! gak perlu juga saya cerita ke security kan klo saya punya mobil dirumah, apa harus naik mobil ke hotel yaa. Saya sering staycation di hotel bintang 5 perlakuan security ga kaya gini , mau naik motor mau naik taksi online tetap di hormati. Keperluan orang ke hotel tu kadang berkunjung ada rekan yg nginap disana, atau mau makan di cafe nya , mau makan di resto nya.. jadi pembelajaran aja seharusnya naik apapun orang datang ke hotel harus di hormati, orang datang ke hotel juga spend money kok.. ga nyolong , gak minta makan gratis"

Jangan hanya tamu utama yg akan menginap di hotel yg menjadi prioritas manajemen tapi mengesampingan kepentingan para supir yg menunggu di parkiran basement. Para supir jga tamu hotel dan mereka juga butuh di manusiakan. Sekian mohon untuk di atensi dan dapat di antisipasi atau di berikan solusi, demi kenyamanan dan primanya manajemen hotel."

Pas sy sebut kamar yg sy inap, ternyata sdh dipakai oleh 1 orang laki² yg sy sendiri dan tim tidak tahu itu siapa (krn room list hny sy dan teman sy yg pegang). Alhasil, suami sy tdk bisa sarapan dg nomor tsb. Dan hrs cari nomor dr kamar lain yg kami pesan untuk di klaim sarapannya. Petugasnya jg tdk cr solusi dan berusaha mengecek laki² tsb drmn dan atas nama siapa. Jd kesannya sy yg salah dan hrs mikir sendiri solusinya.

Bukan masalah nominal, tapi bagaimana fasilitas hotel ini sampai pada kepyasan konsumen. Pilihan makanan brakfast juga ga banyak. Taste biasa aja. Kebersihan selasaran pool juga ada sampah tissue2 bekas. Prokes di breakfast time juga longgar sama tamu2 yg tidak bermasker. Sayang ya kayak gini bgt. Sangat di bawah ekspektasi.

Saya mengajak keluarga saya untuk menginap di hotel ini, sayangnya kami kurang puas dengan pelayanannya. Pertama, liftnya sangat buruk. Bergetar keras, berisik, dan tidak nyaman berada di dalamnya. Fasilitasnya pun luar biasa, tetapi itu belum cukup untuk mengatasi rasa tidak puas kami. Kami mencoba pelayanannya dengan mengenakan pakaian sederhana, beberapa staf tidak menyapa, tersenyum, atau bahkan membelakangi kami. Sarapannya buruk. Kebanyakan rasanya seperti makanan biasa dengan pelayanan yang standar. Bahkan ketika kami meninggalkan kedai kopi, mereka TIDAK menyapa atau mengucapkan terima kasih. Hanya 4 orang yang memberikan pelayanan yang hangat; petugas keamanan yang berjaga di gerbang pim, petugas kolam renang, bell boy, dan petugas keamanan di lobi. Resepsionis tidak memberikan sambutan yang hangat. Dia tidak bertanya tentang masa inap saya, menanyakan apakah ada keluhan, atau mencoba mencari tahu apa yang bisa dilakukan untuk meningkatkan layanan mereka. Dia hanya peduli dengan kunci kamar saya dan memeriksa minibar."
"644.","Zarina","10","2025-01-21","2","Hai, saya terbang dari KL hari Selasa dan check-in terlambat, layanan di konter sangat bagus. Orang-orangnya sangat ramah dan sopan. Namun, malam itu juga saya tidak bisa mengatur AC dan membuat kamar saya yang sangat dingin menjadi lebih hangat. Setiap kali saya menaikkan suhunya, suhu akan turun lagi dan akhirnya saya menyadari bahwa butuh waktu untuk menyesuaikan suhu yang nyaman bagi saya dan saya kedinginan serta ingin sekali tidur, jadi saya mematikannya dan kemudian saya bisa tidur, tetapi kemudian di tengah malam saya harus bangun karena merasa sangat panas dan ini terjadi selama dua malam berturut-turut. Keesokan paginya saya sangat perlu menyetrika kemeja katun dan colokan listrik tidak mau menerima kabel listrik dari setrika. Kabel listriknya seperti tidak pas sehingga setiap kali saya menekannya, listrik akan mengalir, tetapi begitu saya mengangkat tangan, terjadi pemutusan, dan karena itu setrika sama sekali tidak berguna bagi saya. Saya tidak bisa menyetrika kemeja saya pagi itu dan itu benar-benar membuat saya kesal karena jelas saya baru datang dan hanya membawa sedikit pakaian dan saya perlu mengenakan atasan hijau itu hari itu. Saya tidak punya banyak pilihan dan jadwal saya sangat padat. Hari ini, Kamis, adalah satu-satunya hari saya bisa beristirahat. Jadwal saya sangat padat dan saya berharap bisa beristirahat di kamar, tetapi hari ini saya punya waktu untuk meminta teknisi datang ke kamar saya untuk memeriksa colokan listrik dan juga masalah AC. Akhirnya, di hari ketiga, kamar saya dan Intercontinental memiliki suhu yang nyaman bagi saya. Sebelumnya, suhunya sangat dingin, tetapi tebak apa? Masalah lain datang menghampiri saya. Saya masuk ke kamar mandi sekitar satu jam yang lalu dan ada air, setengah lantai kamar mandi saya basah dan bagian dalam toilet juga tergenang air sekitar 2 cm karena ada kebocoran besar dari langit-langit. Saya segera menghubungi manajer yang bertugas. Masih menunggu solusi. Saya akan kedatangan tamu sekitar pukul 8 malam dan saya menghadapi situasi ini di mana saya tidak tahu apakah mereka akan memindahkan saya dari kamar ini? Apakah mereka akan memberi saya kompensasi apa pun? Apakah teknisi dan tukang ledeng akan datang ke kamar saya sekarang, satu-satunya hari di mana saya bisa beristirahat?"
"645.","dr. Budianto Sigalingging","105","2022-01-21","2","Hotel yang bersih dan telah menjalankan protokol kesehatan covid-19 dengan baik. Makanannya lezat. Kamarnya sangat luas dan mewah. Namun, saya juga memiliki pengalaman yang kurang menyenangkan selama menginap di sini.. 1. AC di hari pertama saya menginap tidak dingin. Harus diperbaiki jam 3 pagi. 2. Staf layanan kamar sangat lambat. Sekali perlu memesan sisir. Dan tidak datang lebih dari 30 menit.. harus pergi tanpa layanan. 3. Concierge tidak profesional. 4. Ketika saya ingin pulang, petugas tidak bersedia membantu proses packing. (harus berulang kali meminta bantuan) 5. Saat menunggu penjemputan oleh pengemudi di lounge lobi, duduk bolak-balik diusir karena harus memesan makanan. (Staf tidak ramah) Layanan Anda perlu diperbaiki. Salam"
"646.","Bull Dogg","962","2020-01-21","2","Ini adalah hotel Intercontinental yang baru, berlokasi strategis di pusat kota Jakarta dan terhubung dengan pusat perbelanjaan besar. Stafnya sangat ramah dan membantu, seperti di mana pun di Indonesia. Namun, ada dua hal yang tidak pernah saya alami selama menginap di hotel lebih dari 200 malam per tahun. Pertama, saya diminta untuk mengisi ulang kartu kredit saya di tengah masa inap. Banyak hotel meminta deposit kartu kredit saat check-in untuk keperluan pengelolaan uang tunai, tetapi saya tidak pernah diminta untuk membayar lebih di muka dengan kartu kredit di tengah masa inap. Pihak hotel membatalkan permintaan tersebut setelah saya berbicara dengan manajernya. Meskipun demikian, hal ini memberikan citra buruk bagi Intercontinental sebagai pengelola uang tunai yang rakus, dan membuat pelanggan merasa tidak percaya. Kedua, terkadang ada waktu tunggu untuk sarapan. Saat itu hari Minggu, jadi mungkin tamu dari luar yang menjadi masalah? Tidak, menurut staf restoran, hotel tersebut memiliki tingkat hunian yang tinggi sehingga ada waktu tunggu. Sulit untuk memahami bagaimana Anda bisa mendesain hotel baru tanpa memperhitungkan dimensi restoran sarapan dengan tepat. Selain itu, hotelnya sangat bagus, tetapi saya akan mencoba akomodasi lain di perjalanan saya berikutnya dalam beberapa minggu. Ada banyak pilihan, dan Intercontinental Hotels patut mempertimbangkannya."

"670.","Wulansari Putri","46","2025-01-21","3","Kami mengadakan acara rapat di Hotel ini di dua tanggal yang berbeda dan dengan dua sales yang berbeda dan dapat kami ceritakan kami mengalami dua pengalaman yang berbeda. Kamar dan lokasi bagus, namun sebagai Hotel Berbintang yang cukup tinggi, saya merasakan kesulitan merasakan sentuhan / personal touch yang biasa kami rasakan jika menginap di hotel berbintang lainnya. Seperti saat kami menginap beberapa tahun lalu pernah mencoba memesan minuman dimana ternyata tidak bisa masuk dalam kategori room service dan harus dipesan di Lobby Lounge sedangkan kami ingin konsumsi di kamar. Yang dimana di hotel berbintang lainnya dapat di akomodir, pada akhirnya sama sama menghasilkan pendapatan hanya tempat konsumsi nya yang berbeda. Kami memberikan nilai layanan dengan bintang tiga untuk pengalaman kami yang ditangani oleh sales Ibu Rika untuk acara tanggal 26 Juli. Kembali lagi kami tidak merasakan personal touch, dan merasa kesulitan menghubungi / melakukan korespondensi kepada sales tersebut. Yang berakibat kesulitan melakukan koordinasi dan hal hal lain. Intercon hanya meminta segera pembayaran saja setelah itu kami merasa tidak mendapatkan pelayanan yang sesuai dengan yang kami bayarkan. Untuk acara kami satu lagi kami merasa puas ditangani oleh pihak sales lain."
"671.","Nicholas Krisna","24","2024-01-21","3","Menginap di sana tgl 18 Oktober untuk acara Gathering U******R. Minus : Service nya ngeselin banget si. Entah karena tamu gathering atau bukan, jadi seperti bukan prioritas. Kami masuk salah satu kamar di lt 9, awalnya ngga ada masalah di kamar saat check in. Tapi setelah kami tambah ekstra bed dan cari makan di mall Pondok Indah, sepulangnya ke kamar lantai basah karena kulkas bocor dan ac ngga bisa nyala. Entah apa yang dilakukan staff hotel saat masukin ekstra bed. Staff yang dateng cuma ngelapin yang basah aja dan minta maaf tetapi tidak menawarkan untuk ganti kamar. Harus banget kami tamunya yang marah dulu dan minta staff telpon ke front desk untuk tukar kamar. Masa iya harus tidur sumpek begitu, gambling apakah ac akan nyala mati lagi. Setelah pindah kamar baru pun, proses pindah ekstra bed nya lama sekali. Itu sudah jam 22 lebih, dan kami udah ngantuk. Bisa cek ke staff nya apakah dia sambil beresin kamar lama dulu, atau ngelipet ekstra bed nya lama sekali. Dan yang bikin penasaran. Kami bayar ekstra bed dengan harga around 845rb, tetapi breakfastnya ikut di tempat gathering. Ngga even 1 orang dari kami pun yang staffnya berani ajak ke dalam resto dan tunjukkan menunya bahwa memang benar sama antara menu sugar&spice dengan menu gathering. At least yang bayar ekstra bed lah ya bisa makan di resto, karena setau saya si harga ekstra bed normal ya, bukan harga gathering, karena saya bayar langsung ke hotel, tidak melalui pihak U Silakan koreksi jika saya salah. Entah ada nilai plus lain, kalo servicenya udah ngeselin si, emang prefer ngga balik lagi ya. Saya review 3 star juga karena 2 aspek lainnya (room dan location) menurut saya 4 star, kalo ditotal dan bagi rata jadinya 3 star. Thank you, Intercon Pondok Indah. Semoga pengalaman saya bisa jadi acuan untuk perbaikan service sehingga ngga ada lagi tamu yang kecewa. Btw plus nya menurut saya ada di bawah ini Plus : Ruangan si bagus ya, udah modern, bersih, designnya lebih bagus dari yang di Bandung. Luas juga. Opsi bantal nya aja yang ngga enak, menurut saya, tapi kalo bantal si kecocokan. Lokasi gampang ditemui, tinggal pake Maps. Nyambung mall Pondok Indah juga."

Tapi pada kenyataannya pada tgl 3 September 2023,yg seharusnya saya breakfast di lt 1 dilempar kembali utk breakfast di lt 27. Kejadian yg ke-2, tgl 3 September 2023 saya ke lt 27 utk dinner pada pukul 19.45, yg terjadi di lt 27 sudah kosong melompong tidak ada makanan dan staff. Lalu saya ke lt 1 dan ditolak pula utk dinner di sana, malah diantar ke lt 2 yg mana dinner siapa sdh dimasukkan ke kotak2 makanan berupa 3 macam lauk, 1 sayur dan 1 buah tanpa nasi.

Satu lagi, hotel ini agak diskriminatif haha marketing dan staf hotel juga pasif dan kurang responsif 😄 Baru kali ini kasih 3 stars untuk review hotel bintang 5, tapi memang hospitality itu yang paling penting untuk jasa perhotelan apalagi sekelas intercontinental.

Sama lokal(saya) yah,malah minta table dibersihkan(angkat piring yg sudah selesai), ambil piring bekas pakai berikutnya ga ada basa basi,langsung angkat. Apa hospitality itu memandang ras ya? Training lagi dong karyawan nya.sayang hotel bintang 5. Housekeeper nya malah ramah²,bagus pertahankan. Perlakukan semua tamu baik lokal maupun foreigner itu sama, woh kl sm bule² itu bibir senyum terus kaya orang gila, sama lokal,jangankan senyum,tatap muka aja sepersekian detik. 🤑🤬 [Breakfast kamis,15/01/2026]"
"725.","Shravan Kumar","117","2025-10-21","3","Saat ini saya dan keluarga menginap di Intercontinental Residence selama sebulan, menempati dua kamar di ujung koridor yang saling berhadapan. Kami sangat puas dengan tata letaknya — kamar-kamarnya luas, dilengkapi dapur kecil, dan menawarkan semua fasilitas yang dibutuhkan untuk menginap dengan nyaman, terutama bagi keluarga seperti kami yang baru tiba di Jakarta. Namun, saya ingin menyampaikan keluhan mengenai sistem parkir. Saya diberitahu bahwa setiap kamar berhak mendapatkan satu tempat parkir gratis di B1. Sayangnya, karena tampaknya ada kesalahan sistem, mobil kami terus-menerus ditagih setiap kali keluar dari gedung. Hal ini mengakibatkan pemotongan yang tidak diketahui dari kartu tol e-money kami. Sopir kami menghubungi resepsionis untuk meminta bantuan — baik untuk pengembalian dana maupun isi ulang — tetapi tidak mendapatkan bantuan apa pun. Meskipun ini mungkin tampak seperti masalah kecil, hal ini telah menjadi ketidaknyamanan yang berulang dan sumber frustrasi yang tidak perlu selama masa inap yang seharusnya nyaman. Saya berharap masalah ini dapat segera diselidiki dan diselesaikan, karena kami masih memiliki waktu tersisa selama masa tinggal kami dan akan sangat menghargai pengalaman parkir yang lancar untuk selanjutnya."
"726.","alia alia","7","2025-08-21","3","Setiap Sabtu dan Minggu malam sangat bising karena mobil balap dan suara knalpotnya sangat mengganggu. Mohon diperhatikan lagi. Sayang sekali hotelnya sebagus ini, tapi tidak bisa tidur nyenyak."
"727.","LALA LIFE","14","2025-07-21","3","Saya jarang memberikan komentar, tetapi kami merasa kecewa dengan hotel ini, bahkan Hotel Indigo pun memberikan pelayanan yang lebih baik. Lokasinya sangat bagus, terhubung ke PIM. Karpet & tirainya sangat berdebu, kami memanggil petugas kebersihan untuk menyedot debu kamar tetapi dia malah menggunakan sepatunya di dalam untuk menginjak karpet lagi? Keran bak mandi rusak. Pintu sulit dikunci. Tombol untuk meminta kamar diganti juga rusak sehingga kami harus memanggil petugas untuk meminta kamar diganti. Kolam renang ramai. Kasur & bantal nyaman."
"728.","Muhammad Riandy","39","2025-01-21","3","Pelayanannya bagus, standar bintang 5. Tapi kolam renangnya agak kecil. Momen paling mengecewakan adalah saat sarapan. Pengunjungnya melebihi kapasitas, waktu sarapan jadi sangat ramai dan heboh. Saya mendapat meja yang tidak cocok untuk sarapan bertiga. Kecewa!"
"729.","Wisnu Prasedyoko","4","2025-01-21","3","Baru saja rapat di ballroom dan punya pengalaman buruk soal akses internet. Karena hotelnya kurang ramah soal Wi-Fi gratis (walaupun dulu saya pernah menginap di jaringan hotel serupa di area plaza), saya mengandalkan sinyal seluler yang sama sekali tidak bisa diandalkan. Jadi saya memutuskan untuk pulang lebih awal karena saya butuh koneksi internet untuk beberapa pekerjaan sambil konferensi... Kenapa hotel sebesar ini tidak berbaik hati menyediakan internet berbayar?"
"730.","Atlas","298","2024-01-21","3","Kamar bersih dan mewah. Pelayanannya luar biasa, salut untuk timnya - resepsionis dan restoran Spice untuk sarapan - pujian khusus untuk layanan Cindy. Lounge menyediakan minuman dan makanan yang lezat. Saran saya, cobalah hindari kamar yang menghadap barat laut, jalan tol terowongan - suara mobil dan sepeda motor yang menderu keras setiap malam dari jam 12 malam hingga 5 pagi, bahkan di lantai atas pun Anda bisa merasakan getarannya. Di sisi barat daya ada masjid yang ramai pada jam 8 malam dan 4 pagi. Itulah satu-satunya hal negatif yang saya alami di hotel ini."
"731.","Erin Iryani","37","2022-01-21","3","Saya menghadiri resepsi pernikahan tadi malam dan saya mendapati salah satu pelayan yang melayani meja kami meminta ulasan hotel dari suami saya, yang menurut saya tidak pantas. Dia berdiri di samping suami saya, memastikan suami saya mengetik ulasan, dan ketika suami saya meminta saya untuk melanjutkan mengetik ulasan, pelayan tersebut meminta saya untuk berfoto dengannya untuk diunggah ke web. Dan ketika saya menolak, dia meminta untuk melengkapi ulasan dengan foto dari resepsi pernikahan yang tidak diperbolehkan saat itu. Saya tahu ulasan pelanggan mungkin salah satu KPI untuk pelayan tersebut, tetapi menunggu dan memastikan kami MELAKUKAN ulasan itu menurut saya tidak pantas. Rasanya seperti Anda bersikap baik dan sangat membantu kami, karena Anda menginginkan sesuatu sebagai balasan. Yah, ini hotel bintang 5. Saya pikir hotel ini perlu meningkatkan keramahan staf. Selain masalah ini, resepsionisnya memang membantu, tetapi saya merasa kurang ramah. Dan juga ketika saya datang ke hotel dari pintu akses PIM, dan saya bertanya tentang toilet terdekat, mereka mengarahkan saya ke toilet di Lower Ground, yang ada di tempat parkir. Mereka bahkan tidak memberi tahu bahwa ada toilet yang lebih bagus di samping resepsionis. Staf layanan sama sekali tidak peduli dengan pengalaman pelanggan. Sekali lagi, ini adalah hotel bintang 5. Perlu ada peningkatan yang serius di sini. Makanannya lezat, kamarnya luas dan bersih, kolam renangnya standar."
"732.","Kedung Soejaya","39","2022-01-21","3","Kamarnya bagus karena baru dan juga luas. Namun, mereka tidak memiliki petugas yang mengantarkan pesanan online ke kamar. Bahkan belum tengah malam atau jam 2 pagi, masih jam 9 malam. Sejauh ini, dari semua hotel bintang 5, terutama jaringan global di Indonesia, ini adalah pengalaman baru di mana Anda tidak bisa mendapatkan layanan pengantaran makanan ke kamar. Kecuali hotel yang memiliki batasan untuk memesan makanan dari luar seperti Mulia Jakarta."
"733.","Daripin Wongso","217","2020-01-21","3","Kepiting dan udangnya tidak segar. Kami mengeluh dan mendapat pengganti. Tapi penggantinya juga sama. Steak daging sapinya enak. Makanan lainnya biasa saja. Perlu banyak perbaikan. Namun, stafnya ramah dan membantu."
"734.","Dhikapatrick Piano","34","2020-01-21","3","Kamar-kamarnya luas dan dirancang dengan baik. Beberapa staf hotel ramah, sementara yang lain agak rewel. Makanan di restorannya agak biasa saja, dan pelayanannya tidak secepat hotel bintang 5 lainnya di sekitar Jakarta. Lokasinya yang strategis (jika Anda mencari hotel di Jakarta Selatan) menjadi daya tarik tersendiri."
"735.","Teguh Priyanto","4","2023-01-21","3","Ada kondisi yang sangat perlu ditingkatkan terkait pelayanan terkait tata krama/etika saat sarapan. Teman saya sedang sarapan ketika pelayan tiba-tiba memintanya pindah ke meja lain hanya karena seorang ekspatriat ingin duduk di sana berkelompok dengan temannya. Anda bisa memintanya untuk tidak duduk di sana sebelum ia duduk di sana atau memintanya untuk pindah setelah selesai sarapan/makan."
