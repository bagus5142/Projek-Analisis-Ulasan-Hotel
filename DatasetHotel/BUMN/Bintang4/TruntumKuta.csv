"1.","Lee James","11","2024-12-30","4","Staff very friendly and helpful, nothing was too much! Right next to beach, direct access to beach also! Great location for food, shopping, massages etc. breakfast was really good! Room service and food by pools reasonably priced and was pretty good! 3 lovely, clean pools! Money exchange onsite which was the same rates as the streets! Amazing spa! The resort is quite big so if can’t walk far request a room at the front of hotel! We were in a deluxe pool side room at the front of hotel, room was spacious, clean and modern. Bed was comfortable! Bathroom is a little smaller and at times the bathroom smelt like sewerage- not all the time but I’ve experienced at every hotel I’ve stayed at here, just at random times and not all the time! Rooms at the front are definitely more modern than at the back- other family members with us also booked deluxe pool side rooms, and ours was definitely better, more modern, dividers between balconies which wasn’t at the back rooms- no balconies there just a couple of chairs and table on a step thing but definitely not a balcony! Unfortunately when we all booked, the photos only showed the room I was in, and did not have the older rooms- this may have changed our room preference. Despite those minor issues, I’d stay again! Definitely family friendly and staff were amazing! If booking deluxe pool side, request rooms in the 3000’s not 2000’s"

"4.","Fred “xxx” smith","5","2024-12-30","4","All staff were very friendly including greetings from every staff member as we walked around the property. There are 3 pools to choose from but seating is limited so get there early! We ordered lunch at the pool on several occasions and enjoyed everything. Our room had a balcony and at least twice the door was not locked by service staff. This was a major concern as there is easy access, via the balcony, from the room next door."

"6.","Lis Rijkschroeff","25","2025-03-30","5","Pasar Senggol hanyalah nama yang sebenarnya pasar rakyat dengan harga merakyat tetapi bukan di hotel ini karena harga makanan dan minuman bintang lima. Sebetulnya tanggung air seharga Rp 25k. Hati hati kasir yang tidak jujur tidak mengembalikan uang kembalian dengan benar dengan sengaja. Pegawai yang banyak dan tamu sedikit banyak menganggur dan kebanyakan berbicara dengan sesama kolega mengabaikan tamu yang butuh sesuatu. Harusnya semuanya focus kepada tamu bukannya kebanyakan celoteh² yang aneh bagi tamu. Ruang kasir yang gelap tidak bisa melihat uang dan kassa bon dengan jelas. Ober yang mengabaikan dan tidak memperhatikan request pesanan tamu dengan baik, tugas hanya mengantar makanan , itu saja. Makanan lumayan harganya tidak."
"7.","Hannah Outtrim","4","2024-12-30","5","Great service, great location, great facilities! We had a wonderful 5 day stay here with all of our needs being cared for. A bunch of young females celebrating a birthday and we felt very welcomed. Santi (one of the workers) cared for us every day. Swim up bar was so fun and the restaurant was delicious! We got massages everyday and could walk straight onto the beach to go on our adventures. Our luggage crews safely cared for after check out and the safe in our rooms were in excellent condition. Will be coming back next year!"
"8.","Michael Hendy","5","2024-12-30","5","Really awesome place to stay if you want to be close to the beach and have your choice of 3 private swimming pools! Amazing restaurant with a very co-operative chef, as we caught our own fish and had it personally cooked for us! The restaurant looks over the front pool which also looks over the beach with only a footpath between! Our room was quite large and had heaps of space for me and my friend, our room was cleaned everyday and was very easy to navigate around the large resort! Over-all the customer service was beyond amazing! Our lovely Bell Boy Aryawan, took care of our arrival and departure and greeted us every morning making the whole experience feel a lot more personal! This place is a must when staying in Kuta Beach! I highly recommend booking here to stay!"
"9.","A. Fernando","124","2024-12-30","5","Absolutely loved our stay at this grand old hotel. The location and staff were what made it the best, especially the staff - so warm, welcoming and ever ready to help - special greetings to Laksmi 😊 The location is the best, right by the beach as well as all the shops and restaurants. While the fixtures in the room were old, the AC worked well and the water pressure in the bathroom was also fantastic. The only irritant was not having charger ports next to the beds - inconvenient as we use our phones for alarms, to read, and ambient sound apps etc. However the room was cleaned daily and laundry was also offered for a very reasonable price. While some parts of the hotel were under renovation, there were 2 options for in-hotel dining as well as room service in addition to the 3 pools. Would be happy to revisit if staying again in Kuta."
"10.","ven vs","19","2024-12-30","5","The room was great and clean. The amenities were also complete and I like the sandals the most! It’s so cool and never find any cute sandals like that in other hotels before!! The food were also great and delicious. The location is strategic and beach front!! Love it! Hope the new buildings done soon so I can go back there hoho!! All in all, it was a great experience to stay there and willing to go back there soon! Love it 🖤"
"11.","John Fabri","23","2024-12-30","5","Found the staff to be very welcoming friendly and courteous, the place was spotless. Room was spacious with a comfortable bed and pillows. Excellent breakfast with a large selection. Lunch dinner and in-between.good choice at very reasonable prices drinks were well priced also. Situated in front of the beach great place to watch the sunset. The hotel is not new but would still recommend a stay and and have no problem staying there again."
"12.","Tilly Ferguson","6","2025-01-30","1","This is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at, and I would strongly warn anyone against booking here! Upon arrival, we were told to wait 4 and a half hours before we could check into our rooms. To make matters worse, the rooms were absolutely disgusting—mould everywhere, making it clear they don’t prioritise basic hygiene or maintenance. The so-called “buffet breakfast” was a complete disaster. Food was left uncovered for hours on the beachfront and it’s no surprise that 7 members of my family got seriously unwell after eating it. We had to call 5 doctors, costing us over $1000, and we were all severely sick over New Year’s, ruining what was supposed to be a special holiday. On top of that, we missed planned trips due to this illness, resulting in even more money lost. Bed sheets were not cleaned once during our stay, despite us repeatedly requesting it. When we finally brought all these issues to the general manager and asked for compensation, he had the audacity to offer us ONE car for seven people to travel to the airport. Are you serious? This hotel is a disgrace—poor hygiene, terrible service, and food preparation that is outright dangerous. Stay away unless you want your health and your holiday ruined!"

"14.","Mitchell Norton","4","2025-01-30","1","Absolutely horrendous experience at this hotel. We arrived on time for check-in, only to be made to wait an outrageous 4 hours and 30 minutes before we could access our room. Completely unacceptable! The so-called “buffet breakfast” near the beachfront was a disaster—left out in the heat for hours without any covers, creating a breeding ground for bacteria. As a result, my entire family of seven came down with Bali belly, ruining three days of our holiday. To make matters worse, the housekeeping was atrocious. Despite specifically requesting clean sheets, they were only properly changed once during our five-day stay. This is the bare minimum one expects from a 4-star hotel, and they failed miserably. Avoid this hotel at all costs unless you want your vacation ruined by negligence and lack of basic hospitality. If I could give 0 stars I would."

"16.","Sariyadi Sariyadi","191","2024-12-30","5","Truntum Kuta Bali (dulunya Grand Inna Kuta) tampaknya menjadi pilihan akomodasi yang populer di Kuta, khususnya bagi mereka yang mencari kenyamanan dan lokasi strategis.

"18.","Gaby Kalschoven","21","2024-12-30","1","We were due to stay 4 nights but checked out after night 1. The hotel is old and in need of serious renovation. The hotel falsely is advertised as a clean 4 star hotel but everything is dirty, the room had a mildew like stench to it, mould in the bathroom and all the walls were damaged or peeling. The lamps were mouldy with water stains. The staff isn't particularly friendly or service oriented, they are mainly concerned you give the hotel a bad review. We told them we weren't happy, very disappointed and asked for a different room. This was only possible when we accepted a same room (with a walk-in shower instead of showering in the bathtub)or pay extra. Because we were so unhappy we decided to go to another hotel. They didn't refund for the rest of the stay, so we took our loss and left. Be warned, the photos and reviews are not true in my opinion."
"19.","Robinta Sembiring Pelawi","307","2024-12-30","3","Lokasi nya sangat strategis terletak di pinggir pantai, tapi kamar nya butuh upgrade interior sesuai dengan perkembangan zaman. Sy di kamar pool access, ada teras kamar yg langsung akses kolam renang, nyaman dengan akses nya.. drain shower mampet air sampai tergenang, dispenser sabun dan shampo terlepas krn hanya pakai double tape, plafon belang² bekas bocor air Lantai kamar lembab terus padahal AC seharian sudah dimatikan.. Saran: manajemen sangat perlu berbenah khususnya bagian interior design krn sudah ketinggalan zaman dan terlalu usang.. respon problem solving & teknis maintenance MEP nya juga sangat parah, krn sy sudah lapor drain dan shampoo yg lepas tp tidak ada tindakan sama sekali.. Sayang sekali karena lokasi sangat strategis, karyawan nya ramah² tp gagal di interior dan maintenance nya ‼️ Sy kasi skor bintang 3, jika interior di upgrade dan maintenance nya OK baru layak bintang 5 👍👍👍"

"21.","ChunTung Lau","53","2024-12-30","5","The location is great, next to the beach and walking distances to 2 of the shopping mall in kuta, Bali. The staffs showed me the hospitality of Balinese people. A day before my check out, I would to send so post cards and the staff at the reception helped me to confirm a got enough stamp on my post cards and sent it for me as it was the weekend. After I came back home, I received an email from the hotel notifying me that the cards had been sent. Strongly recommended stay there for a comfortable leisure vacation."
"22.","Nissa Nia","778","2025-04-30","5","Hotel lama, untungnya masih good maintenance sih, jadi ac,air, penerangan , semua baik...dan keuntungan hotel lama adalah kamarnya relatif luas..petugasnya ramah & helpfull, check in & check out cepat, lokasi dekat pantai ..ke beachwalk juga tinggal jalan kaki sebentar"
"23.","buyung mahendra","646","2025-03-30","5","In the past this hotel name is Grand Inna Kuta. This is a 4 star hotel. The price is worth it for you and famiily vacation. The room rate is same like at pangandaran beach or puncak bogor or jakarta. Deluxe room using bathtub is our recommend. The view is swimming pool. The restaurant is in fron of the beach, so you can breakfast with beach view."
"24.","Wahab Affan","164","2024-12-30","5","-kamar : untuk kamar kebetulan dapat kamar di lantai bawah yang ada balkon nya yang bisa langsung menuju kolam renang, kamar lumayan oke dan nyaman -layanan : pelayanan cukup oke, bisa menitipkan barang setelah checkout, untuk kolam renang bisa diakses dari jam 6 pagi - 6 malam, kolam renang ada 2, dekat resto dan di utama.. Namun sangat ditayangkan, tidak ada tempat gym di hotel ini.. -resto: untuk resto dari makanan cukup variatif. -Lokasi : lokasi sangat strategis, kepantai kuta cukup jalan kaki, dan dekat dengan tempat suvenir, disini juga menyediakan layanan antar jemput hotel - bandara tarifnya 250rb.."

The hotel big with a lot of green and 3 swimming pools. Was great joined Tuesday buffet dinner with Balinese performance."
"28.","ayush mittal","284","2024-12-30","3","The location is the best part of this hotel. But the property is aging and needs some upgrades. Rooms are fine though. Staff is good and service is prompt. The restaurant and pool area can be upgraded to offer better view of the beach which is blocked by trees and shacks as of now. Cocktails at the poolside bar were impressive. They appeared more like mocktails."
"29.","Lucky Adhi Pradana","72","2025-01-30","5","Lokasi hotel bisa masuk kategori istimewa karena langsung berada di pantai kuta. Kita bsa langsung menikmati pemandangan pantai saat breakfast di pagi hari. Kamar lumayan rapi, dan memang sedikit agak old scholl tp ok lah. Service pelayanan hotel ramah2 dan sangat membantu. Good job. Oiya makanan yg disajikan jg lumayan beraneka ragam dari makanan eastern maupun western nya."
"30.","Mrs E","49","2024-12-30","5","Fantastic location. Literally next to Legian Beach. Massage spas all around and even one inside the hotel. Love their massage services by the pool as well. Very decently priced at Christmas time and being a last minute booking and all. Staff are very friendly and courteous. Rooms are very clean close to the pools. 24 hour room service which works well when the boys want to chat all night long and have some advice beer orders. Daily morning breakfast is really good food, delicious and by the beach! Love their pop up restaurant at the front of the hotel - Warung Senggol, food and music is fantastic there! Traditional food!"
"31.","Danielle Langsford-Tabone","28","2024-12-30","3","We got a poolside room, it was very average. I feel that it was slightly overpriced for the room itself, but the location was ideal. The bathroom is a bit eek, the provide shampoo, but no conditioner. I know it’s not a massive issue, but it was a slight inconvenience. We weren’t a big fan of the breakfast, but others seemed to enjoy it. Staff were helpful and lovely. Pool bar is nice, but closes at 7pm."

"33.","Inga Tamminga","22","2025-01-30","5","Stayed a week and could not fault this hotel! Got upgraded on arrival from a jnr suite to a Executive Suite and wow, such a large comfortable room, with part ocean view out the balcony and pool view from the other window (room 2240 - second floor). Third floor would have even better views. My 9YR old comfortably slept on the couch using a sheet we brought from home at no extra charge, she said it was comfy. I found the king bed very comfortable and they had two sizes of pillows (but I brought my own). Loveee that the room was quiet, never heard any other guests. This hotel is huge! And our room was right down the end so a bit of walking but worth it. Gardens are immaculate, every single staff smiles and says hello. Breakfast was so good! Two fresh egg/omelette stations, alternating hot food choices, really nice artisan seeded bread options etc etc. Waffles and pancakes alternate each second day so kids were always happy. The only things I didn't like was no outside visitors allowed for in room massage or hair braiding (nanny is ok) and the aircon is really cold in the room so bring a jumper. Also fireworks randomly on the beach some nights which is super loud and wakes the kids. Day spa was ok, $17au 1 hour massage on special, nice room, average quality massage and could hear people talking which was annoying. Drinks by the pool $10au for cocktails before 6pm, which were nice and strong / tasty. Oh and room service was fantastic, quick tasty & resonably priced ($8au nasi goreng $10au pizza). Overall I would definitely recommend!"
"34.","Alex Ward","22","2025-04-30","5","loved our stay here. rooms were clean, staff very friendly and the 3 pools amazing. location is fabulous, close to everything and you are right on the beach too."
"35.","V. Ivan Sutanto","12","2024-12-30","4","The hotel location is definitely great, very close to the beach even though not own beach. Restaurants, shops and malls are just nearby. However, Grand Inna/Truntrum is probably one of the first hotel in Kuta area, and therefore need renovation. We booked deluxe rooms and suite for three families. The suite were fine, but the deluxe rooms (wings 24xx) were probably the first rooms and definitely need renovation. The TV is too small and channels selections are limited. The AC system is also old. Breakfast and staffs are good. Overall still recommended!"
"36.","Anthony Martin","10","2024-12-30","5","I cannot recommend this place highly enough. Fantastic location on the beach front with 3 excellent pools including a swim up bar. Meals are top quality including the full spread breakfast, which never failed to please. We had a pool view room which made it feel like we had our own pool. Staff are super friendly and always smiling 😃"
"37.","Michael Angelo","4","2024-12-30","5","Amazing service. Very Professional staff. Delicious breakfast and all the staff were wonderful, a special mention to Edi, Hendri and Dian. they are so helpful and welcoming. Thank you for the great service and experience ❤️ Literally the best hotel in Bali, next to beach and the location is perfect. The entire hotel is neat and secured. I’ll definitely come back!"
"38.","Shaan Singh","6","2024-12-30","5","This place is top tier. it has everything u need. perfect location, multiple pools, a swim-up bar, amazing breakfast, an amazing room, many places I can just sit and relax all over the hotel. it has beach access as well. The service also is top tier. One of the days, I forgot my bag at the breakfast place. When I went back to retrieve it and informed the staff, they were swift to retrieve it for me from the lost and found. The Bell department is amazing and very friendly. I wanna give props to Hilmy, who showed us to our room and told us about everything that the room and the hotel had to offer. And when we checked out after a week, he was still able to remember our room number. The Housekeeping service is on time and swift. I wanna give props to Darmawan who never failed to clean our room well and was always there at our service. I stayed in one of the best rooms I've ever stayed in, it had a balcony facing the ocean and Kuta beach, it has an amazing view of the Kelapa Pool and the toilets all over the hotel are equipped with a Bidet. I also wanna compliment Santi and Erna from the breakfast place every morning who were super friendly and were ready to help with our every request. When the door to our balcony couldn't lock properly, the Engineering team were swift to send up someone to fix it quickly. Every single staff member is approachable and is ready to help with whatever you need. And to top it off, the stay was affordable and well priced. All in all, this was a top tier stay and I would 110% stay here again if I were to visit Bali once more."
"39.","OHANAチャンネル","31","2024-12-30","4","My favourite hotel in Bali The hotel name has changed, but everything inside is the same My daughter and I went to the pool and when we returned to the room the housekeeping staff made an elephant and a dog out of towels for us. It was very nice and I was impressed Whenever I go on a trip, I always eat steak at the hotel restaurant. Unfortunately, when I ordered the steak I was looking forward to, it tasted better in the past."
"40.","Juni Sean","7","2024-12-30","3","Awal lihat dionline site sangat menggiurkan, akhirnya booking langsung ke hotelnya, kamar pool side + extrabed untuk anak kena 500k incl breakfast, breakfast lengkap & banyak😊 - hotel : lokasi bagus samping pantai kuta persis, hanya letak kamarnya lumayan berputar-putar. - stafs : super nice! Recommended mulai dari front office sigap, cepat, cekatan & informatif, siap membantu kapan aja, bahkan mau bantu anakku jemput gofood karena anakku ga bisa bahasa indonesia, mereka mau nunggu anakku sampai selesai dengan gofood👍, hanya sayang duty manager untuk sekelas truntum ga bisa bahasa inggris jadi minus point. -kamar : luas kamar, furniture, fasilitas 👍, hanya kami sangat kurang beruntung dapat room pool view pertama masuk air kran wc bau seperti air got, dipakai mandi gantian lobang pembuangan air mandi yg bau, telpon sampai 2 kali tetap bau, telpon lagi ke3x, tidak tahu apa yang mereka lakukan bau hilang tapi dipakai mandi lagi malah jadi banjir😤, akhirnya telpon ke 4x suami sudah mulai marah minta ganti kamar lain ( kamar dipojok depan pool yang ada tanaman ditengahnya lihat foto). Semoga kedepannya lebih baik lagi😊"
"41.","ed lee","31","2024-12-30","5","Great location. 5 mins to Kuta beach from your bed! But room. 1st room - bathroom leaking from the ceiling. 2nd room, when open the front door, there is smells like diesel fumes from generator. Other than that, food is great! Location is the best! The staffs are wonderful! Will stay again in the future."
"42.","Bima Yudha","7","2025-01-30","2","Hotel Indonesia Group takeover dari Inna tidak ada perubahan yang signifikan dari sisi bangunan karena masih renovasi. untuk service, cukup mengecewakan. sudah book Grand Deluxe dari Mei, dikasih kamar Deluxe dengan alasan sama aja kamarnya dan dekat dengan pool"
"43.","S","20","2024-12-30","3","The hotel is outdated in our opinion. Also it’s being renovated which doesn’t add up to the vibe. It feels like a half hotel which isn’t ready yet. The breakfast and service is good though. Rooms are okay but are worn out. Also, if you’re looking from peace away from all the pushy services the locals trying to sell, don’t come here. There’s many ladies constantly offering hairbraiding, massages and when they have nothing to do, they’ll just cut their toe nails at the pool for everyone to see."
"44.","Asdani Kindarto","279","2024-12-30","5","Hotel cukup mewah dan luas, langsung dekat pantai Kuta. Ada Kolam renang, taman dan fasilitas spa. Kekurangannya penomoran kamar tidak berdasarkan lantai, agak membingungkan di awal. Bahkan resto nya mepet Pantai. Cari makan malam bisa di depan Hotel, tapi warung pkl agak susah ditemui, jauh jalannya. Parkir luas. Di tepi jalan raya. Untuk bawa keluarga cocok"
"45.","Kylie Webb","13","2025-05-30","5","I was staying at the Bali Garden Resort - I came for breakfast and coffee. Both excelent. Fabulous sitting people watching, by the pool, looking at the sea. Special thanks to Lastri who was excelent in the restaurant 👏👏"
"46.","Fresh Prince","75","2024-12-30","5","Great hotel by the beach. Location was the best among all the hotels I have stayed over the years. Excellent breakfast but no fresh coffee served. A minus for coffee lovers. Foods were excellent and lots of varieties. There were 3 different pools to cool down"

"48.","Chris Family Reviews","31","2024-12-30","4","This hotel definitely impressed us from the day we checked in to the day we left. Pros: -best location~ right at beach with a range of shops and restaurants from cheap to pricey. There are -sea-facing rooms available. -resort is massive in size. There are 3 pools. Many blocks with lifts. -rooms are big and clean. -chargeable services such as hair-braiding and massages are also available at the pool. -hotel also organised various events to keep guests entertained. There was a foam party and middle-eastern night. These were chargeable though. -we managed to get our room early when we arrived at about 12pm. The staff came to personally inform us about it. This surprised us as we were walking around at one of the pools. -friendly staff~ hospitality is top-notch. Every member greets us whenever we walk past. I would like to especially commend the following staff who went out of their way to make our stay very memorable. •Santi & Erna of breakfast restaurant who were attentive to attended to our requests promptly. •Dharmawan of house keeping who diligently and very efficiently cleaned our room daily and even did an extra clean of the floor again that day when my son dirtied it with sand. •Hilmi of bell department made a great impression on the 1st day when he introduced the many facilities to us as he led us to our room. To our surprise, he remembered our room when we checked out a week later. That was really impressive! Cons: -no gym -no coffee machine at breakfast -there were flies and bees buzzing about on the jam and pastries during breakfast -balcony kept getting flooded due to heavy rain -hotel difficult to navigate due to its huge size and some parts being closed as it was under Reno. Perhaps, a map or pamphlet with update info on navigation and events can be given during check in. Overall, hotel surpassed our expectations and we would definitely return."
"49.","Cola Curry","4","2023-12-30","5","The hotel's beachfront location was exactly what we were looking for, allowing us to enjoy the close proximity to various restaurants, shopping areas, and, in particular, our favorite beach bar, Jimmy's Bar. We loved being able to easily explore the vibrant local area and unwind at Jimmy's Bar watching the stunning sunsets and enjoying the refreshing drinks and lively atmosphere. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was outstanding, offering a wide variety of delicious options to suit every palate. The view from the restaurant overlooking Kuta Beach was simply superb, making each morning a delightful and picturesque start to the day. The rooms at Grand Inna Kuta were great, bed was comfortable and the air conditioning provided a welcome relief from the Bali heat, ensuring we stayed cool and comfortable throughout our stay. The staff at the hotel were incredibly lively and accommodating, always going the extra mile to ensure our needs were met. Additionally, the swim-up bar was also fantastic. We would definitely choose to stay at Grand Inna Kuta again in the future."

Pertama kali datang lgsg disambut dengan sangat friendly dan diberi voucher welcome drink. Kamarnya bagus dan modern serta tidak ada mslh apa2. Kelapa poolnya saya suka sekali karena besar dan bersih. Namun area ganti pakaian dekat kelapa pool lebih baik di renovasi. Lantainya terlalu tua dan agak lumutan. Tp scr keseluruhan menginap disni nyaman dan tenang. Terima kasih"
"51.","Tash Phillips","12","2024-12-30","5","Lovely older style place. We couldn’t fault the place. Staff were so warm and welcoming. They would always help with anything we needed. They go above and beyond. The food is delicious. The rooms were cleaned and restocked daily by a wonderful hard working team. The place is well set up with 3 pools. We will definitely be rebooking next year. Our favourite staff member Intan checked on us daily to make sure our stay was fabulous. See you all next year😊☺️"
"52.","Les","16","2024-12-30","4","Recently stayed here in a Deluxe Pool Room for 5 days. Found the accommodation to be clean and reasonable for the price paid. Staff were very happy and helpful , particularly the gentleman on front desk (was sorry not to get his name). Things were a little quirky however, such as sunset pool that closed before sunset. Swim up bar that had been boarded up and now used as general seating area. Main restaurant that was advertised as open and usable but looked like it had not been used in months. These things aside would still recommend."

It was very busy this year so we did spend a little more time on the beach. But I cannot fault this hotel. The cocktails , breakfast, food and staff were just great...."

My accommodation didn't come with breakfast which I would assume is a must in bali. Not their fault I didn't check at time of booking online but still paid the same as my stay a week before with breakfast. Thought the management would offer us breakfast but they would not budge on extra charge of $90 ($15 pp per day) Australian for our 3n stay. Which was pretty disappointing. We just ate breakfast outside hotel. Other than that great stay. Have stayed here 4 times now.. with hubby couple times and with family"

"63.","Cindy-Anne Pirie","160","2024-12-30","4","Truntum has 3 pools and beach frontage. It’s walking distance to many great bars and restaurants. Buffett breakfast is included and offers egg stations, pancakes stations with many different cuisine options. Rooms are big and well appointed there was some mould in the shower and hot water took ages to get warm which is why I didn’t give it 5 stars. Room service has great food which is delivered quickly. Drink prices were reasonable and they offer 2 for 1 happy hours daily. Massages are offered around the pool but are expensive compared to local shops. There’s a money changer on site which is so convenient. There’s a Warung onsite but we didn’t eat there. Overall it’s a great hotel but be prepared to hear fireworks half the night as they set them off on the beach constantly."
"64.","Kate Crowell","6","2024-12-30","5","We stayed here mid July and absolutely loved it. We booked a family room, which had a large king bed, bunks and a portacot we requested for our 1yo. Our room was large and has so much space for the 4 of us. Breakfast buffet was delicious. There was something for everyone. The pools were great. We loved the toddler/baby area in each one. The drinks and food were very well priced and so yummy. Thank you to all staff who made us feel incredibly welcomed no matter where we were in the hotel. Aryawan the bell boy was so friendly every time we entered and exited the hotel, and he made sure to remember our children's names and say hello. Thank you Aryawan! We cannot wait to visit Bali again and stay at Truntum. We are looking forward to seeing the renovations."

Room service options were delicious as well. The pool was amazing. I specially enjoyed their wellness service which in my opinion were beyond my expectations. The location was great, close to Hard Rock Bali, Beach, SPAs. The hotel was surrounded by greenery that leaves you in wonder! I have to applaud the staff for being so kind. They made my experience in Kuta one of a kind and I loved it"
"66.","Bev Anderson","6","2024-12-30","1","I am here now, The maintenance of this place is terrible, our friends had mould in their bathroom. The pool area needs cleaning and the staff needs to be diligent with people smoking and spitting in the pool. Please use better cocktail mixes. The food at breakfast isn’t great especially when the omelette is pre made. Please stop watering down the shampoo and body wash. That’s just my short version of what’s wrong with the hotel. I have stayed here before but never again. Extremely annoying."

"68.","Preet Mahajan","119","2024-12-30","5","Our first stay in Bali began with a memorable experience at the Truntum Hotel in Kuta. I had requested a birthday room décor for my daughter's 4th birthday, and it was superbly done. The decorations exceeded our expectations and made the celebration extra special. A special thanks to Ms. Laxmi at the reception and all the other staff for being so courteous and helpful throughout our stay. Their warm hospitality made us feel truly welcome. The hotel's location is fantastic, right at the beach and within close proximity to major shopping areas and a variety of food shops. This made it very convenient for us to explore the local area. One of the highlights of our stay was the hotel's three swimming pools. The best view is from the pool near the main restaurant, which overlooks the beach and offers an incredible sunset view. It was the perfect spot to relax and enjoy the beautiful surroundings. Overall, our stay at Truntum Hotel was perfect. From the excellent service to the beautiful location and amenities, everything was top-notch. We highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Bali."

Not far from Hard Rock, culinary places at Kuta area, souvenir shops, and a few minutes walk to Kuta Beachwalk Mall. Hotel staff were friendly and very helpful, and we also would like to say thank you to the hotel staff who prepared a surprise for our 25th anniversary. We hope to come back here again next year..🙏🙏🙏"

Kamarnya cukup nyaman, ac jg dingin, kamar mandi ada bathtub nya. Perlengkapan mandi jg lengkap mulai dari handuk, sampo sabun, sikat gigi dan pasta gigi, sisir. Ruang meeting jg cukup luas, cuma ketika sdh siang, lumayan panas, akhirnya hari berikutnya ditambahkan dengan ac portable. Makannya cukup enak, hanya saja menurit saya pribadi kurang variatif dari sisi menunya. Kamarnya cukup jauh dari lobi, jd hrs siapkan energi utk jalan mau masuk atau keluar kamar."

It has a beach club and spa. Food: Mediocre breakfast buffet. No menu catched my like. Location: litteraly in the side of kuta beach. Close to Hardrock, 10-mins away from beachwalk mall and many minimarts around."

"83.","Fatimah Nataningrum","61","2023-12-30","4","I can't say it is one of the good hotels that I have ever stayed at. The service was average. My partner and I booked an Executive Suite room for 5 nights. The room was spacious and good, BUT accessing the room took time from the lobby. Could you consider placing the lobby in the middle of the hotel? That way, we wouldn't have to waste 10 minutes walking from our room to the lobby. The breakfast was average. I was disappointed that they charged 50k rupiah for coffee during breakfast"
"84.","Andrew Kim","13","2023-12-30","5","The last stay place of our 21 days journey in Bali. Really friendly staffs in reception, housekeeping, restaurant, pool bar and everywhere. 3 each swimming pools have particular attractions. Location just faces to the beach, nice to enjoy romentic sunset everyday. Good room condition with great function of air-conditioning, the unique structured Deluxe room is interesting(terrace is outfront of door). Come for breakfast earlier the better, due to crowded people on late. Very delightful time I had during the stay. However, one thing that is regrettable is that the water quality of the water supply is not good enough that the filter turns black after using it once. If possible, it's good to bring a shower filter head for personal use."
"85.","sanjana yadav","9","2024-12-30","2","Checked in today. Feel disappointed and let down with the hotel hospitality. We booked the executive suite (which we got 1.5 hrs late after much back and forth) and got dinner buffet vouchers for NYE. At the time of booking the hotel didn't inform us about these vouchers nor was there any intimation at any time that these will be given.. So we went ahead and made Nye dinner reservations at another place and paid for that. My husband requested for the voucher to be adjusted on any other day for dinner so we can use it. The hotel manager /staff flatly refused. This is not how Truntrum Kuta will get repeat customers!! This was our 2nd time at bali and 1st visit at this hotel.."
"86.","nik budhdeo","2","2023-12-30","5","Just came back from a 2 week stay at Grand Inna Kuta. Lets get something straight with all the people leaving bad reviews. Yes, the rooms are a bit dated and the bath towels do need renewing. There were some issues on our first day which were quickly rectified, for what you are paying what do you expect. BUT One of the best hotels I have stayed in for customer service, the staff at this hotel are fantastic and nothing is too much trouble. They made the stay pleasing and enjoyable. Always greeting with a big smile. The hotel is centrally located and very convenient. Food was good and at breakfast if I wanted something they would make it and bring it to me. The food at the outdoor restaraunt at the front of the hotel was so so so yummy. I will stay again when I visit Bali"
"87.","Andrew N","157","2024-12-30","5","We were only here for one night as we flew in late and it was well located to the airport. Excellent location to the hub of Kuta and a stone’s throw away from the beach. The site itself is quite large and is very well facilitated. Staff are excellent!"
"88.","Cheryl Huxley","145","2024-12-30","4","Lovely hotel even if the rooms are a little dated. Close to the beach. Breakfast is amazing - there are so many choices. It's served earlier than what we were told by reception which was especially good when we had to leave the hotel early on a couple of days. The food served at the restaurant was good, we ate there for both lunch and dinner. Apart from the one staff member on reception, all the rest of the staff were very friendly and helpful. Pool area is very nice although several Australians were quite loud. We had an issue with our flight and asked reception if they could call TransNusa on our behalf due to the language barrier. The person on reception, for whatever reason, claimed she couldn't get through - it wouldn't even ring! TransNusa's phone number is located in Jakarta and the person on reception didn't think she needed to use the area code for Jakarta! We tried to explain and she claimed she tried again with the area code and still couldn't get through. Very displeasing service as when we had no option but to ring TransNusa ourselves, we got straight through!"

"93.","Tamas Kinsztler","36","2024-12-30","1","The hotel is over rated and priced compared to what it really is. You can find better hotels in this area. We payed extra for panorama ocean view, for this extra we could see the ugly roof of the hotel and the outdoor units of the air conditioner, this is really a scam. The air conditioner didn't work in our first room, after that we reported this to the reception, they sent someone to fix it while we were in town. When we arrived, the room was dirty and the air conditioner was still not working. We went down to the reception again, then they gave us another room sarcastically asking in the new room if it's going to be cold enough here? Yes, the air conditioner was working there, which should work without saying since it's 33 degrees outside. The hotel building is in a very bad condition and is not a 4-star hotel at all, the bathroom is also in an extremely bad condition, the water is dripping, the shower head is disgusting, the soap dispenser has fallen out of place. The beach next to the hotel is full of vendors who are very annoying and the beach is dirty. There is a constant traffic jam in the area, which makes it very difficult to reach the hotel by car and requires a lot of extra time. The breakfast is not tasty, there is not much choice, too many people, there is a hunger war in the restaurant. Cold meats are served outside a refrigerator without ice and there is no air condition in the room, this is not safe at all. We paid extra for late checkout upon our arrival, but after the lot of inconvenience, we canceled it next day at the reception, we have not received a refund since then. We have to start a claim through the bank."

"95.","Budi Soetjipto","311","2024-12-30","4","I stayed for one night for a business meeting in this hotel. The hotel is actually an old one but was recently renovated and renamed into Truntum. The lobby is considered big (see pictures), and the hotel is still under some renovations that made the re-route going to my room a little confusing. I had a dinner in Warung Senggol, which is part of the hotel, and it took me almost 30 minutes to find my room. I tried not to ask the hotel staff to test myself if I could find my room. The room itself was a decent one. It's not too big with a comfy bed (see pictures). All amenities worked well, including the AC, internet connection, and water shower. The water shower was strong, but the direction was not according to what I wanted. The foods were mediocre at best, both in Warung Senggol (see picture) and in breakfast. The services were helpful and prompt. The location of this hotel in the heart of the Kuta area makes it easier to find shops and cafés nearby. Overall, I had an enjoyable experience staying in this Truntum Hotel."

RESTO: Untuk orang indo, mungkin cukup boring ya, karna gitu gitu aja, tapi dimaklumi, mungkin menunya emang lebih fokus untuk tourist, tapi rasanya okelah, cuma kurang variatif aja, viewnya bagus, ada pool dan pantai. BEACH ACCESS: Akses kepantai Kutanya enak banget, lewat samping hotel deket Resto, cuma emang ga terlalu rapi aja Section pantai yg ada di zona hotel."
"106.","Pey Hungkul","358","2022-12-30","5","Buat kami yang tidak banyak menuntut, pelayanan dan fasilitas hotel ini sudah lumayan baik. Untuk lokasi jangan tanya, hotel ini almost best location in Kuta area. Fasilitas di kamar yang kami tempati semua berfungsi dengan normal, AC yang dingin bahkan sangat dingin, pas waktu tidur selalu kami matikan, water heater/shower/keran air panas juga normal. Yang kurang adalah pencahayaan yang menurut saya kurang terang, lampu memang banyak, tapi hanya lampu-lampu temaram yang berada di pinggiran atau pojokan dinding, seperti tidak ada “lampu utama” ditengah plafon. Tidak ada colokan listrik dekat tempat tidur, colokan listrik berada dekat cermin meja rias/meja kerja dan di tempat pemanas air. Untuk lift juga harus diperhatikan lagi perawantannya, lift yang berada di area resto itu maaf bau dapur, berasa berada di lift operasional/lift barang yang berada di mall-mall. Para staff hotel sangat ramah, mulai dari resepsionis sampai cleaning service semua selalu menyapa kami setiap kali berpapasan dengan kami. Apalagi ada salah satu staff resto yang sempat menawarkan baby sitting ketika anak kami rewel saat sedang sarapan, kami sangat menghargai itu hanya saja anak kami yang tidak mau. Iya, selama 3 malam kami menginap disini, menu sarapan hanya itu-itu saja. Maka siasat saya setelah membaca beberapa review disini agar tidak bosan saya mencoba untuk tidak kalap ingin makan semua makanan yang ada di hari pertama, jadi berasa makan makanan yang berbeda selama tiga hari. Rasa makanannya just not bad. Selebihnya kurang tahu karena kami tidak terlalu banyak mengexplore semua fasilitas hotel seperti kolam renang dan lain-lain, karena kami lebih sering berada diluar hotel dibanding menikmati semua fasilitas hotel. Terima kasih Grand Inna Kuta, semoga kami bisa berkunjung kembali di lain kesempatan."

The hotel's prime location right on Kuta Beach offered stunning views and easy access to the beach, making it an ideal choice for beach lovers and those seeking to immerse themselves in the vibrant atmosphere of Bali. The check-in process was smooth and efficient, and the staff members were warm and welcoming throughout my stay. They were always ready to assist with any inquiries or requests, which added to the overall sense of comfort and hospitality. The hotel's facilities were impressive, offering a range of amenities to cater to various interests and needs. The pool area was spacious and well-maintained, providing a relaxing environment to unwind and soak up the sun. Additionally, the beachfront location allowed for effortless transitions between the pool and the beach. The rooms at Grand Inna Kuta were spacious, clean, and equipped with modern amenities. The comfortable beds ensured a restful night's sleep, and the sea view from the balcony was a delightful bonus. Housekeeping was prompt and efficient, maintaining the rooms in top-notch condition. One of the standout features of the hotel was the delicious and diverse breakfast buffet. It offered a wide selection of both local and international cuisines, catering to various palates. The dining experience was complemented by the beautiful views of the ocean, creating a perfect start to each day. Being in the heart of Kuta, the hotel was surrounded by numerous dining, shopping, and entertainment options, making it a convenient base for exploring the area. Whether it was strolling along the beach or exploring nearby attractions, Grand Inna Kuta's location made it easy to experience the best of what Bali has to offer. However, the hotel's central location means that it can get quite busy and noisy at times, especially during peak tourist seasons. This might not be ideal for those seeking a tranquil and secluded retreat. In conclusion, Grand Inna Kuta is a fantastic choice for travelers looking to experience the vibrant and dynamic atmosphere of Kuta Beach. With its prime beachfront location, attentive staff, and excellent facilities, the hotel offers a delightful stay for both leisure and business travelers. While it might not be the most serene option due to its central location, the convenience and the overall experience make it a top-notch choice for a memorable stay in Bali."

"116.","Moana Phillips-Edwards","11","2024-12-30","5","In the heart of Kuta, amazing service and amenities. When you get there, pay the 500,000($50nzd) rupiah deposit, and you can charge the room. Nothing like a mocktail in the sunken pool bar with the kids on floaties. You can also get your nails, hair braided or eyelashes done beside the pool. The spa was amazing, 75 minute massage for 250,000 rupiah, much better than walking the street to a local salon and having to deal with the street vendors."

The hotel facilities are also complete and good. But the price is not cheap, according to what we get."

"125.","Lady Fransisca","243","2022-12-30","4","This was a well-known hotel since in the 80s. However, some parts of the hotel were just being renovated. The property is big, they have 3 swimming pools. The location is just the opposite of Hard Rock Cafe, by Pantai Kuta. Beach Walk mall and Discovery are just walking distance. The room is modern and clean. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. However, the breakfast is just so-so. There were many staffs to serve and help during the service. The coffee and tea were too dark/bitter when I came around 8-9 oclock. The menu selection is outdated and limited. But I like the fact that we can have breakfast by the beach"
"126.","gideon lam","359","2022-12-30","4","It is located rather near the airport. The room is spacious and the bed is very comfortable. Housekeeping is excellent too. The service there is excellent and the people are polite. They also have security to ensure safety. However, having meals there is quite expensive. Prepare to spend around $10-$20 for each meal. A beer cost $4 and a breakfast buffet cost $15. Pick-up to the airport is expensive. $20 to drive you 3km to the airport."

"130.","Sheila Amabel","5","2023-12-30","3","Worst 4star hotel that i ever stay... Pelayanannya jelek dr awal booking kamar, ada request kamar berdekatan eh malah sampe beda lantai beda building. Klo misal nya buat sesama temen kaum muda sih mending yah, ini ngajak lansia yg klo arah jalan bisa bingung gtu malah dikasih room nya yg jauh bukan main... Dah gtu dari awal sblm booking kan ada nanya, ada bak mandi bayi ga soalnya ada anak bayi. Awal sih ok yah dari pihak mereka saranin buat ditulis request yg ada bath tub, kirain pelayanan bakal ok nih,,, eh ternyata hari H malah ga dapet kamar itu. Tau gtu mending cari tempat lain drpd bayi mandi di wastafel.. sandal hotel sempet ga dpt katanya kehabisan Minjam extra towel ga ada alasan lg penuh (ya ini masih dimaklumi sih krna kdg terjadi di hotel lain), Yg aneh 2 hari pertama minta air panas saat breakfast buat bikin susu bayi eh malah disuruh bayar sekarang.. buset dah pelit abisss..: orang2 minum air putih aja free refill berkali2 apalagi jam breakfast, ini mah minta air panas aja masa disuruh bayar.. Kacau dah.."
"131.","Nic Mitch","16","2022-12-30","3","The place is very rundown but excellent location. Great breakfast over looking the beach. We had a ocean view room and while lovely to watch the sunset with the floor to roof windows, once the afternoon sun hit it was unbearably hot and the little air con was powerless against it. Smart TVs would be a huge improvement as there is nothing to watch on the 3 english channels. The staff are sensational!!!"

When we approached the Manager Yani, she was extremely helpful and understanding and immediately accommodated us in an executive suite with extra beds. She followed up on us till we settled in the room. The entire staff was extremely helpful. The place itself is right at Kuta beach, the breakfast view is worth it. Breakfast buffet Food was delicious with lots of options. Strongly recommended place if you visit Bali."
"133.","Freandy David","223","2022-12-30","5","Saya kasi judul :Sempurna Kenapa sempurna, karena untuk ukuran hotel tua, konsistensi dan perawatannya tergolong bagus. Hotel Inna, atau Grand Inna di Bali ada 3. 1 di Denpasar, 1di Sanur (yg paling tua dan paling besar) dan yg 1nya lagi di Kuta, tempat saya menginap sekalian mereview. Lokasi : Strategis karena persis di tikungan jalan ke pantai Kuta. Semua orang pasti selalu nengok hotel ini, karena cuma di kanan jalan dengan logo dan namanya yang eye catchy. Room : Bagus, luas, bersih, nyaman, tidak berbau, AC dingin kencang dan view ke pantai. Resto/breakfast : Banyak menu pilihan dan enak, tapi tidak enak banget loh yaaa. Pelayanan cepat dan ramah. Harga : Relatif terjangkau untuk hotel berbintang sekitaran situ. Akses : Pantai Kuta tinggal nyeberang dari resto, KFC, Yoshinoya, Flapjack, Circle K, Indomaret, Jamie Oliver resto, HardRock, pusat suvenir, Beacwalk, seafood resto semua dekat. Transportasi : Dari dan ke airport cuma 15 menit +- kalau tidak macet. Parkir : Luas banget di dalam untuk mobil dan motor. Akses disabilitas : Ada jalur untuk kursi roda Ok segitu aja dulu, semoga yang baca review saya kapan2 bisa main kesini. Selanjutnya bisa cek di youtube : @freandydavid"
"134.","Eva Kingsley","218","2021-12-30","4","They upgraded our room into a pool view, which is so nice. Service was great. The room is very spacious & has a warming interior, but the bathroom is quite small. The hotel area slightly resembles a maze to me. If you have a so-so or bad sense of direction, better draw a map. Breakfast area is by the pool next to the beach, the food selection was standard, it's just not so pleasant when it gets too crowded. Wifi sucks."
"135.","Ed James","46","2023-12-30","5","One of the best hotels I have stayed in Bali. Hotel is in very good condition. Its very big, 3 nice pools and room was clean, modern, and comfortable. Bathroom was great and nice hot shower with good water pressure. Very good value too and the buffet breakfast was excellent with a large selection and very fresh. The best part of my stay were the staff. Every staff member I came accross said hello and had a big smile. The staff moral is very good and they went above and beyond numerous times and I only stayed 1 night. Special mention to Muklis who showed us to our room and also looked after our luggage after we checked out. Muklis helped us to the pool showers so we could have a shower before our flight and carried our bags everywhere. He is an absolute credit to your hotel. Also Mustana, who we only breifly dealt with was so amazing and put us in a taxi and was super friendly. I highly recommend Truntum Kuta, its my best experience in Bali on over a dozen trips in 20 years. Thank you, Darin Ed"
"136.","Cale Shipman","76","2022-12-30","4","The staff are super lovely and so welcoming, everyone always greeted us and asked us if we needed anything or how we were. The rooms are lovely could do with some refurbishing as well as the facilities around the hotel. The hotel it’s self was always clean and the staff tidied our room daily always supplying us with fresh linen. Had a wonderful experience."
"137.","Wahyu Permana","268","2023-12-30","5","Lokasinya mudah ditemukan. Parkirannya cukup luas. Harga sesuai dengan fasilitas. Ada 2 swimming pool yang tersedia. Panoramanya menghadap kelaut, seperti umumnya hotel hotel di Bali. Namun karena memiliki 3 gedung dengan penamaan kamar yang agak tidak umum, jadi ketika diwaktu awal menginap pasti bingung ketika mencari resto dan jalur lainnya."
"138.","Scott Kecil","15","2023-12-30","2","We just needed a place to stay in Kuta as a little bit of a stopover between destinations and to get some clothes tailored. Location is pretty central in Kuta and right near the beach. Given the price of this place we were a little disappointed. Staff are friendly enough and say hello, however rooms and facilities are looking a little tired. The breakfast is a little like the place, bland, busy and generally unfulfilling. What was most disappointing was we asked lady at reception to book us a taxi to the airport, to which she replied yes and wrote down - however when we arrived at the time were advised “no taxis”, we have drivers to take you for 200k. Wasn’t worth fighting at that stage, just will never be back"
"139.","Budiman Angsanajaya","888","2022-12-30","4","Menginap di sini setelah sempat pindah2 dari daerah Ubud dan Uluwatu. Ini juga pertama kali lagi menginap di daerah Kuta setelah lebih sering menginap di daerah Seminyak. Lokasi adalah keunggulan utama dari Grand Inna Kuta, jika ingin memilih hotel yang berlokasi persis di tepi pantai dengan harga terjangkau, hotel ini sangat direkomendasikan...👍 Tapi beberapa hal yang cukup mengecewakan adalah AC di kamar kurang dingin, ada spot bocor persis di atas shower kamar mandi, toliet di restoran sarapan juga kotor dan banyak fasilitas hotel yang rusak, mungkin karena memang karena umur hotel yang sudah cukup tua. Pilihan menu dan rasa sarapan juga standar. Walaupun begitu sesuai informasi Saya di atas, Saya tetap merekomendasikan hotel ini jika memang mencari hotel di daerah Kuta yang terletak persis di pinggir pantai dengan harga terjangkau. Keunggulan lain adalah banyak mini market di sekitarnya, jadi mudah membeli air mineral jika kurang, karena di hotel maksimal hanya disediakan 4 botol ukuran 600 ml per hari. Tips dari Saya adalah jika ingin pemandangan pantai dari sofa, silahkan memilih Junior Suite, tetapi yang jadi catatan adalah kamar ini tanpa balkon"

I was given a birthday cake compliments of the hotel , delivered to our room. We were also given a lovely fruit platter. The ladies in the spa were absolutely beautiful (we spent quite a bit of time in there)The only thing we could fault was the toilets at the breakfast area. No fault of staff but very very high traffic area. All the other amenities were perfectly clean. Fantastic location. Cant wait to stay with you again."

When we got back, the money was no were to be seen. And since we had only just got there from the airport and had not spent any money. It was quite sad to realise what had happened to it. Most staff are friendly its just sad that one bad staff member puts the look on all of them. We also did not get compensated at all 😕"

But mostly I would like to give a massive shout out to Dion in reception he is a true gem and asset to the hotel he has been absolutely amazing When the personalised 40th birthday cake I had previously ordered from a shop outside of the hotel failed miserably he managed to save the day and source me a cake in like an hour . Such a kind person he went above and beyond for me. So if you ever stay here and need anything Dion is your man."

"148.","Debashis Roy","76","2017-12-30","4","I have stayed at Grand Inna Kuta for 5 night. During my stay, I celebrated the New year. The hotel is just beside beach and walking distance to the Kuta Center. The Hotel has two part old building and new building. All deluxe rooms are located at new building whereas all standard rooms located in the old building. The old building is three-floor building and not having the lift installed. I liked most the location of the hotel and the swimming pools. The hotel has three good swimming pool. Two are located inside the hotel and other next to the beach. As I traveled with my son, we took a room with king size bed. The bed was so big that we were very comfortable on it. The hotel serves complimentary breakfast. The breakfast was average but not bad. The room's floor was so moist and some of the electric points were not working. The air condition was not properly working in one of my room. The staffs were very good and attentive. Many shopping locations and food shop are very close to the hotel."

The hotel has just been taken over and I imagine that there will be some upcoming upgrades to pretty it up. Little things like the bathroom light switch frame fell off as I swanned though to the pool,I just laughed and stuck it back on,black marks on outside of buildings from covid maintenance shutting down,easily fixed,air-conditioner units on rusted out frames outside our pool side door,the sea air will do that,just don't look,focus on finding the funny little squirrels first and last light they jump though the trees. Our beds and pillows were too firm for us (both suffer from chronic back pain),they happily wacked and couple of mattress toppers on the beds and gave us new pillows,see all easy fixes. Food was nice,view was awesome. Being able to walk out onto the pool from our delux pool side suites were the best,unstocked mini bar,tea coffee water daily,restaurant,ice cream shop in hotel lobby entrance,money exchange across the rd,atms opposite and same side of hotel entrance,multiple mini marts and bonus no rd between you and the ocean.

"161.","Yuliana Jiu Dias","324","2021-12-30","5","Letak strategis, benar2 didepan pantai kuta. Ada 3 kolam renang, yg paling besar namanya Kelapa pool,,saya paling suka karena rindang. Petugas hotel juga nawarin pijat kaki atau badan, juga bisa pasang kutex. Soal harga silahkan saling tawar aja. Kalau saya 100 rb 30 menit pijat kaki. Saya ga nawar karena tau Bali sangat jatuh perekonomiannya. Jarang ada tamu banyak jika tidak saat liburan seperti libur nataru ini Dan ada yg dibibir pantai poolnya. Kolam renang jernih terawat (padahal dimasa pandemi tingkat hunian jarang terisi banyak tamu) Staf ramah, kamar bersih sayang banyak nyamuknya (saya ambil yg family room 3233) Area hotel luas jadi lumayan olahraga kalau mau ke antar kamar jika terpisah gedung Area hotel yang nyambung kepantai bisa buat trek joging, sepedaan. Sayangnya jika mau nyantai diarea hotel yg berbatasan langsung dg pantai, banyak pedagang asongan yg bisa masuk dan ngejar2 untuk beli dagangannya (tatto temporary, jual kain, jasa pijat). Jadinya ga nyaman, kita mau santai tapi mereka ngedeketin terus bergantian. Padahal spot itu menurut saya yang paling enak dan bagus buat menikmati pantai Kuta"

"163.","Michelle","29","2022-12-30","2","Great location and friendly staff. Found the buffet breakfast food to be cold on several occasions. Lunch ordered once in the HQ dining area where I saw a rat and they forgot my partners meal (only 2 of us and not busy). Room service food twice tasted like it had been left in and warmer for too long and was dried out. The WIFI continually dropped out. I had to report this multiple times a day! I could tell they were getting sick of me. Don’t stay here if you need to use WIFI. Our room had a broken rain shower that was never fixed and sink plug that maintenance had to lift up to drain the water every day. The air conditioner was quite dirty and didn’t provide enough cool air once the afternoon sun hit so we had to keep the blinds closed and block out our ocean view. Rooms really need maintenance. Would not expect this from a fairly expensive hotel. Probably won’t be back to this location, plenty of other places in Kuta beach area."

It has direct view to the beach, literally direct to the beach! Too bad we only stayed here for 3 nights, the room is clean, breakfast great, dinner was great and with affordable price. Definitely will come back and stay longer. ❤"
"167.","Eva Anggreani","68","2021-12-30","5","Tempatnya enak. Stafnya ramah. Pada saat datang diberi voucher utk ditukarkan dgn welcome drink di cafe hotel. Klo menurut sya, bangunannya sudh agak tua dan interior kamarnya menurut sya standar saja, tpi kelebihan disini adl posisi hotelnya yg tepat berhadapan dgn pantai kuta. Sya mencoba menginap di Deluxe Sea View (dpt harga 577k booking dri website hotel) dan Deluxe Room (extend lgsg di front desk dpt harga 500), isi kamar dan interior kedua tipe kamar tsb sama persis. Yg membedakan hanya view jendelanya saja. Tapi dgn harga segini utk sekelas hotel ini, worth the money bgt sih."
"168.","Arif Wahyudi","9","2024-12-30","4","Stayed in 3128 type of room grand deluxe room with garden view. The bathroom has a faucet for wudhu. The bed is 200x120x2 (2 single beds attached) and very comfortable. 30 feet to the pool and 50 feet to the beach. Discovery Hotel is more luxurious, but the shower is leaking everywhere, the pillow is too thick and too hard, less comfortable compared to the one in Truntum. The beach at truntum is definitely better than Discovery. In truntum beach, you can rent Body Board for $3 per day, Beer Bintang for $2 per botol, Surfing board for $20 per day, Coconut for $2.50, full body massage on the beach for $10 an hour. You have to buy something to sit on the plastik chair provided by the street vendor to watch Sunset. In Discovery Beach, there is no street vendor. The sand is too soughy and is not kid friendly."
"169.","nibbles","3","2023-12-30","3","We have just returned after 7 nights at this hotel. The rooms are modern, gardens well tended and position is fabulous. Breakfast was very busy and seating was sometimes difficult to find. The pools were very disappointing. Each morning towels were placed on pool chairs by guests. Making it very difficult for guest to get a chair in a shady spot or even get a chair at all. The pool staff did nothing to police this. At one point a guest was verbally abused by another guest as she had sat on a pool chair that this awful woman thought was hers, because it had a towel and magazine on it. This very loud woman was never spoken to by any of the staff and every day after that, her 2 towels were placed on the same 2 pool chairs every morning and left there all day. During this altercation the staff watched on and did absolutely nothing. Another problem was unsupervised children in the pool. Parents sometimes nowhere in site. Slapping pool noodles on the pool water repeatedly, screaming and yelling and parents just ignoring their behaviour. Another problem was mothers feeding their children while in the pool. Sometimes leaving rice and vegetables floating in the water. Whatever happened to children getting out of the water to eat? I did email the GM at the hotel, but I did not receive a response. If you are looking for a stress free hotel, where you can lie by the pool on a pool chair and be able to have some peace, do not stay at this hotel!"
"170.","Ridha Fauziah","116","2022-12-30","4","Saya menginap 5 malam di Grand Inna Kuta, sebenarnya hotel yang strategis sekali secara lokasi, tepat bersebelahan dengan Pantai Kuta. Dekat dengan Beach Walk Mall, Discovery Mall, Water Boom dll. Akan lebih asyik jika pihak hotel menyediakan sepeda angin untuk tamu, sehingga memudahkan tamu untuk lebih eksplore sekitar Kuta. Dan sayang sekali kondisi cenderung kurang terawat (mungkin karena pandemi), tempat parkir terbatas mengingat banyaknya jumlah kamar, colokan listrik hanya ada di meja tv , tidak ada di dekat tempat tidur. Untungnya pihak engineering hotel sigap dengan permintaan saya akan kabel sambung, sehingga tetap bisa menggunakan gadget meskipun sambil tiduran. Untuk sarapan, menu kurang bervariasi, bahkan di hari pertama buah sudah lembek. Semoga ke depan akan jadi hotel yang lebih nyaman."
"171.","Dan Buffett","10","2024-12-30","4","Good location if you want to be in Kuta. Hotel is old but will maintained. Larger pool needs a regular clean, with the water getting murky by 11am. Wouldn't hurt to improve the breakfast, maybe a hashbrown or like as you usually end up with Bali belly at some point."
"172.","Acha","61","2024-12-30","5","Kamarnya bersih, nyaman. Hotelnya pinggir pantai kuta jd pas makan pagi bisa sambil menikmati suasana pantai. Ada kolam renangnya juga.. Dekat dengan mall kalau misalnya mau ngemall 😁 rekommended 👍"
"173.","Simon Flower","22","2019-12-30","5","Second time staying here, we emailed and asked for connecting rooms on the ground floor and got exactly that. The rooms are clean and a good size, the buffet breakfast has a great variety and more than enough for everyone. All the staff are friendly and helpful. Pool with a swim up bar with a beach view. My family have been to Bali many times but l think Grand Inna will be the hotel for us in the future."
"174.","Putu Agung","138","2023-12-30","4","This is a nice hotel with three swimming pools. Breakfast changes most days but there is not a huge selection. But plenty to eat. Our room, 3125 is nice. Shower is fine. Bed is comfy."

Kalau disuruh pilih dan menilai saya lebih senang kamar yg sea view , hehehe. Oke, meski begitu sebenarnya saya senang dengan hotel ini dengan apapun tipe kamarnya, Karena: 1. Ruang kamar nyaman,bersih, kasurnya luas dan empuk, ada sofa panjang, untuk yg tipe garden view tersedia balkon. 2. Staf nya responsif ya, begitu saya datang di lobi langsung dibantu pindahin barang bawaan ke bellboy trolley. 3. Area parkir luas 4. Lokasi nya juara, ke pantai kuta tinggal jalan kaki 5 menit sampai , dekat dengan beachwalk ,pusat perbelanjaan dan sentra kuliner . Oh ya kalo malam di depan area hotel ada pujasera yg dikelola hotel grand inna . Makanan yg dijual enak2 , pantesan bertahan ."

"179.","A M","206","2022-12-30","4","I had a lovely stay at Grand Inna Kuta in a ground floor pool access room in the beach wing. It is quite a big sprawling hotel which is extremely confusing at the start but give yourself some time to explore and you’ll be fine! The room was very clean and comfortable, made up in the time it took for us to go for a little walk each morning. I loved coming and going via the beach exit at the HQ restaurant, going right toward Beachwalk mall and left to loop around past many shops and Kuta Square. Having never stayed in Kuta before, I found the location to be fantastic. The other guests were a real mixed bag, to be expected at a large affordable resort but mostly quiet and inoffensive. All staff I encountered were extremely friendly, particularly Made on our first day who took us to our room and the various attendants at the Kelapa pool. I didn’t love being asked every few minutes by the pool if I wanted a massage / pedicure by spa staff etc as you get that enough walking down Kuta beach but no one was ever forceful or rude which I appreciated. I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone considering it! Enjoy :)"
"180.","Koko Lie","76","2022-12-30","5","Memilih hotel ini karena dekat dengan pantai, jadi nya bisa stay di hotel saja dan refreshing di pantai Kute, kolam renang nya juga ada 3, kita bebas mau berenang dimanapun. Untuk kamar bersih, fasilitasnya oke, untuk sarapan nya sih lebih dominan masakan western, mungkin tamunya kebanyakan bule nya... tp overall kami sekeluarga senang menginap di sini"
"181.","ADP 1994","45","2017-12-30","4","First off the positives: the place itself is perfectly situated, food is great and service super nice and welcoming, within 5 min you're at the beach, next door is a surfing school, taxi service is present and the city life is a 5-10 min walk. So everything you could need is close by. There are 3 pools (1 was closed while we were there for reconstruction) and many extra services available including a pool bar. However, when we entered our room, we found a thick layer of dust on top of the bed structure and stains on the bed sheets. With everything else so perfect, it was a bit sad to see such easy things neglected. Overall we still really enjoyed our stay and had a great time."
"182.","Arlyne Indrayani","67","2021-12-30","5","Oke nginep disini, sebelah hotel langsung pantai kuta, jd pagi2 enak buat jogging antara jam 6-7 pagi, selebihnya udah mulai ramai. Makanan dekat dan banyak.. Buat anak2 aku suka karena kolam renangnya banyak, jd gak ramai walaupun kmrn infonya kamar juga banyak yg terisi. Breakfast untuk ukuran hotel bintang 4 pilihan gak banyak, rasa cukup enak. Kamar bersih, tapi karena hotel cukup besar, siap2 jalan jauh kalau dapat kamar di ujung. Tapi masih oke kok. So far recommended ya buat family vacation"
"183.","Prananda Navitas","107","2021-12-30","4","Great location: direct access to the beach! This place has not one, not two, but three pools! The building may look old and dreary, but the renovated rooms are very comfortable. We stayed for five nights in a deluxe room with a balcony facing the sunken pool. The only reason I am giving four stars is because of the mould on the bathroom ceiling and the leaky sink (drips right at the end of the u-bend). Other than that, I wish the management would segregate the smokers from the non-smokers in the breakfast area."
"184.","Albert Adiputra","32","2021-12-30","5","The hotel is within walking distance from the renowned Kuta beach. Staff are friendly and helpful. Rooms are spacious and clean and if you are lucky enough, the view from your room would be great.

I know the corona situation effect everyone but a 4 star hotel ( ???) should be better. The breakfast was flat. Big holes in the floor where we eat. People smoking in the cafeteria. The trolley the staff use to move the used cutlery and plates was very dirty. It is forbidden according to the Indonesian law to smoke public but the hotel provide ash bear in the cafeteria with no separate area. Only positive was that the beach was close"

Sarapan mulai jam 07.00 WITA di Headquarter Resto, makanan dilayani oleh staff resto, untuk minuman selfservice. Pemandangan resto langsung menghadap Pantai Kuta, sarapan ditemani deruan ombak di tepi pantai dengan angin sepoi-sepoi."

Jd tempat wisata mulai di buka perlahan. Kami jg mendapat hrg promo di sini. Stlh melalui proses standar protokol kesehatan, kami check in.Proses check in berjalan lancar. Staf2 dr security, petugas front office sdh berumur tp mereka ramah2 semua. Kami dpt kamar di lt 1 yg lsg akses ke pool.Kamar bersih walau terlihat tua. Toiletrees berkelas . Compliment lgk spt teh, kopi, gula, air mineral. Tp kopi dan teh cm dpt 1. Sandal yg disediakan pun bukan sandal yg cepat rusak tp sandel karet yg bagus. Baru pertama kali dpt sandal spt ini. Wifi ada tp lemot pdhl yg pake sedikit. Sinyal operator jg lemah di sini. Breakfast ternyata ala carte. Mungkin krn tamu sepi. Malamnya ada Senggol di tempat parkir hotel. Harga lumayan murah itk makanan di hotel dan enak. Overall kami puas. Dg harga yg kami dpt dan melihat hotel2 yg lg strugling di musim Pandemi ini."

The room that I stayed was very comfortable and clean. My room was a deluxe sea view suite, from my room I can see the sunset while editing some pictures on my laptop. The foods that we had in Breeze Restaurant for dinner are very tasty! (I love the chocolate milkshake). The buffet breakfast has so many varieties, love it! Oh, I had the afternoon tea package, the snacks/cakes were so delicious. I recommended it. One of the best things about Grand Inna Kuta besides its foods, room, friendly staffs is that this hotel has a direct access to Kuta Beach and it’s near restaurants and shopping center (Kuta Square)."

Memiliki banyak resto, ada resto yang menghadap langsung ke pantai. Setelah pandemi, bulan Oktober 2021 sudah sangat ramai pengunjung. Kamar standar nyaman dan bersih, tetapi karena bangunan lama bentuk bangunannya tidak tinggi ke atas tapi melebar, jadi kamar di nomor terakhir harus muter jauh karena paling ujung dan agak sepi."

It doesn't suit the luxury of the pool and location of this hotel. We got a room which has bad toilet smell. We asked to change the room, they were happy to accommodate that even though we had to wait for more than an hour in hour room to get the other room ready for us. Location is the best! They have 2 pools and they both are great. Buffet breakfast wasn't mind blowing but the view and restaurant location is facing the ocean and its beautiful! We might come back just for the location and the service. We got a welcome plate with fruits and towel doves on the bed to celebrate our honeymoon. Staff are friendly. Overall we enjoy our stay."

"205.","J L","38","2023-12-30","4","1. All the floor staff (housekeepers, cleaners, bell boys, guards, pool and wait staff) are absolutely lovely, joyous and cheerful, plenty of warm greetings, and always very happy to help (Reception staff were pleasant and helpful but more reserved and distant - this is still fine) 2. You should note that photos even on google reviews do not reflect that the beach is now a busy market strip - right in front of the beach pool is an endless line of market stalls, a busy beach-long walkway with motorcycles and sellers. We avoided the beach pool despite having hoped for it to be a highlight of our trip, because it felt like swimming in a shopping centre. Sellers do not interact with you on hotel grounds but once you step past the boundary line they will flock to you for sales. 3. The pools were nice but somehow looked a lot better and larger in the pics. Still nice, and well maintained. 4. There were several gaps in the housekeeping quality when we arrived, however they were enthusiastically happy to rectify and assist as soon as asked, even in the middle of the night. The housekeeping staff were a joy to interact with on our daily morning greetings and their genuinely warm offers to help, I was very touched. 5. Location is unbeatable and I think superior to any other hotel in Kuta: At the beach exit (where the beach bar and pool is), is .the bustling beach market. Walk on along and you're at a nice clutch of local warungs (having several in one place is very hard to find in Kuta) in a pedestrian area and still facing the beach. How else can you dine beachside with 3K IDR dishes and comfy plastic chairs and tables, and with no touting sellers? .Walk on and you get to local tourist-goods stalls in a pedestrian strip, and then you reach the main road shopping area (start braving the touts), with western brands of goods, and eg. McDs and the japanese FamilyMart. At the main exit is several minimarts (first one is owned by the hotel) and ATMs, and a legitimate money changer. .Turn left and walk along the millionIDR hotel strip (or on the other side of the street to the beachfront market strip). This will bring you to lots of large party bars, and then the multimillionIDR Western-style shopping mall with tons of money clearly poured into decor and design. There's also a decent cinema with the latest movies for 4K IDR. .Turn right and you're at the main Kuta strip of endless stores lining a one-way single-lane road - all the tourist shopping and massage spas you could want, and good midrange restaurants. The small road means that while it's busy, the traffic is always crawling along slowly and therefore easy to cross the street (slowly, steadily, and making sure the driver sees you)."

Kamar pun sangat lembab, bnyk jamur di tembok kamar (tidak sehat ntuk paru paru) Sekali lg saya mohon Maaf mengeluh, tp memang kenyataan seperti itu di hotel Grand Inna Kuta.

"212.","Ilse Hubach","8","2023-12-30","1","What was once a beautiful 4star hotel has turned into a rundown facility with the surrounding area also in absolute dire state. The staff tried their best to accommodate us, showing us different option rooms but the one was as bad as the other. Although we could not fault the staff, helpful and professional at all times, it was sad to see how it is expected of them to keep this sinking boat afloat while clearly this hotel is in desperate need of maintenance, cleaning, paint and an upgrade...not to mention the vomiting state the bathrooms are in. What was once our favorite hotel has turned into a sad, dirty building where not even the grass surrounding the swimming pool survived the neglect. What was meant to be a two week stay at Grand Inna Kuta, turned into a one night sickening experience from which we checked out as quickly as we could."
"213.","Tones","67","2023-12-30","1","If I could rate this 0 I would. I was due to stay 4 nights but checked out after night 1. The hotel is disgusting, old, and dilapidated. The hotel falsely is advertised as a clean 4 star hotel with “ocean views”. Everything is dirty, the room had a mildew like stench to it, all the walls were damaged or peeling, the bed was so uncomfortable and the air conditioner was loud. The lamps were mouldy with water stains. The “deluxe sea view” is obstructed by old rusty buildings. Whilst the staff in person were very lovely they refused a refund for the rest of the stay. Be warned."

Kolam renang yg sangat indah dgn bunga2 disertai suara ombak dr pantai dan tupai serta burung yg beterbangan. Sangat asri😍. 3. Restoran yg menghadap kolam renang luar dan pantai, membuat betah berlama2 duduk. 4. Kamar dan kamar mandi bersih."

The hotel need a bit more maintanence but in their favor Painters were already on the job in outdoor areas. The personel were very serviceminded and the rooms well cleaned. All services, such as drivers and activities were availeble for a reasonable price."

Went to our room and WiFi wasn’t working also the sink didn’t flush. So we went to the reception and they told us that the were going to solve it. Half hour later.. no one showed up. Back to reception to ask for an other room. Got to see another room that should be ready but was dirty with a lot of hair in the shower.🤢 complained to the manager and asked for a free upgrade because of the inconvenience, took us more than an hour and a half of our time, but nothing was possible. They moved us to same size room but a “clean one” what looked clean at first but when I opened the sheets is was completely dirty!! 🤢🤮 Complaint again, but didn’t got a response…. They came to change the sheets but staff was really rude!!! I would not recommend this hotel at all!!!"

Yes it’s a little outdated but Covid has affected all of Bali. It’s close to the beach and waterbom park. There’s plenty of restaurants around too and shops are close, room Service is great and so are the staff. I highly recommend this hotel."

"231.","Syahiful Sulung","311","2018-12-30","5","Salah Satu Hotel Terbaik di Bali yang letaknya sangat Strategis dekat dengan Pusat oleh2 dan tentunya berdampingan dengan Segara Beach dan Kuta Beach. Hotel Grand Inna Kuta dari awal Masuk sudah memuaskan dan terjamin keamanannya, salah satunya dengan check Mobil yang masuk. Tetapi pada jam Malam Hari mobil sudah tidak di periksa lagi. 😅 Awal check In pegawainya Ramah banget dan Cekatan, dapan Welcome Drink pula segar seharian di Bandara. Disini Ada 3 Kolam Renang, semua kolam renangnya luas dan bersih. Ada satu yang spesial yaitu Kolam Renang Samping Bibir Pantai. Mantab kan? Tentunya Sekarang kita review makanannya, makanan cukup beragam dan perpaduan Indonesia dan Luar Negeri. Rasa dari makanan disini HQ Restauran biasa aja dan belum ada taste yg spesial di lidah saya. Mungkin karena dsni menyesuaikan diri karena banyak tamu dari Luar Negeri yang tidak terbiasa dengan bumbu yg kuat. All in bagus dan nyaman. Saya menginap dua hari dsini. Cukup memuaskan dan Tetep semangat dan terus maju Grand Inna Kuta. Bye bye"

"233.","V-Ryssra","12","2023-12-30","1","The staffs is friendly but I have bad experince about the room and how Front staff solves our problem. The air conditioning is broken. (Water drop) After we informed them, they sent maintenance team to us. They told us bc it's not cleaned yet but it's will be fine. The team will clean it tomorrow...? Question, they don't maintenance it properly??? That's how we are ending up woken up at 2am with A LOT of sweat. So in the morning we requested them AGAIN to change the room for 2nd night. We came back and found that the staff just cleaned the air con and confirmed us that it still works well. It's pretty upset me since the maintenance team confirmed that it works fine so our requested to change the room was ignored and we have to call maintenance team again on 2nd night because its still boiling hot in there... Normally i don't have high hope for great services but this decision is not good enough. It simply can be solved by changing room since they got all day to decide what to do. Dissapointed. More about the room: not clean, noisy"

"236.","Riki","24","2023-12-30","2","It is in the heart of kuta however there are huts on the beach blocking the ‘beachfront view’. It also rained when we stayed there and the water came through the sliding door. The water from the bath smelt like sewerage. The shower water overflowed into the main bathroom everyday. The balcony is made of timber and says ‘do not lean’ - that was a safety concern. The air con was locked and we couldn’t make it cooler in the room. Executive suite is on the other side of the hotel and a lengthy walk to the entrance."

"247.","Yannick Wendling","55","2016-12-30","1","Only good point : direct access to the beach. For everything else, it is absolutely overpriced (room, beverages), the sea view I paid for is awful as everything I can see is an iron roof (with the sea far far behind it). Hotel is like a factory and infrastructures are clearly under-dimensioned. Pools may be great but there is a 60% chance you won't find a place to sit and therefore you have to go somewhere else. Same for the sea section. Worst hotel I ever had in Bali, so easy to find way better for a much better price as well."
"248.","David Horvath","2","2018-12-30","2","There is nothing Grand about this hotel any more. I was let down on my last visit and it did not meet my expectations. HQ Bar has a poor menu, and when I asked for a milkshake for my partner, I was told it was not on their beverage list and to go to the other pool and order it there. When I was presented a food menu, twice we where told they had run out of the requested item. The Bathroom flooded every night, we reported it and where told that it is an old hotel. No one was concerned. But I guess that's the relaxed Bali attitude. Attention to detail is a must for all Hotels which this establishment seems to have forgotten. It's tired and old."

The food here is lovingly made, and the hotel staff members are super friendly. The rooms are decent and fairly large. With hot showers. Best part of the room is the well stocked fridge (non-alcoholic) that is complementary in addition to the usual tea and coffee. The reason why I don't give a full 5 stars is because they've decided to replace their iconic two-color hotel rubber flip-flops to the regular ones. Bring them back please!"

One of the guys that broke a glass had to get stitches but not sure why they woulda remove guests that are causing a liability to others. Also the photo below the little guy didn’t like the free breakfast either. Drinks were 2-3x more expensive at pool bar be going to any beach bar down the street. Would not recommend eating at this hotel."

However the hotel guys can change my Twin Bed into Double and that's not big problem for me. The room is clean, comfortable bed, and the ac is good. But the bath kit is not complete because there's no shampoo, only shower gel. The LCD tv is not big enough. I stayed for 2 nights and the breakfast have complete and various menu from appetizers, main menu, and dessert.

If you have any group that book in your hotel, please make their schedule of breakfast and inform them not to make some noise, its very anoying in the morning with their activity. Others than that 3 things, everything is good, but need to improve fast. How ever you have a good spot to attract more tourist, its so shamefull if you dont do this right away.

However the Aircon in our room did not work properly. It was very hot when we arrived so we called them to check and they send staffs to clean the aircon which takes around 30 minutes and we saw how dirty it was. Hoping it will get better after that but still aircon is not cold enough. The hotel also did not offer us to change room (maybe they are all fully booked? we don't know). It is an old hotel so the hotel area looks as what we expect, room still okay looks like they renovated it. Room is clean (we got a room near front office seems better than the ones on the other side) but the lights in the room i thinks are not enough also the biggest problem is the aircon made our stay uncomfortable and want to move hotel."

Walk out the front hotel straight onto the beach takes around 10 seconds, and there are dozens of beach bars, well eskies full of beer and plastic seats , to sit and watch the sunset, but you will get hassled by everyone selling all sorts and they’ll sit on the sand by you for 10 minutes until they realise you are not going to buy anything.All in all a nice place to stay in a convenient location just needs maintenance to bring it up to standard."
"281.","luluk harini","126","2018-12-30","5","Lokasi hotel sangat strategis. Selangkah ke pantai dan bahkan resto tempat sarapan menghadap ke pantai. Dekat tempat perbelanjaan. kebersihan ok. Stafnya ramah-ramah. Menu sarapan cukup variatif. Ada nasi campur khas bali juga. Menginap 3 malam dapat bonus foto session. Kalau untuk seru-seruan bagus juga, terutama kalau kita tidak membawa kamera yang bagus"

No separated smoking area, very uncomfortable for guest with kids. The staff are very friendly and kind, i think management can do better than this."
"284.","RICCI RICARDO SUTRISNO","220","2022-12-30","4","Hotel yg bersih,lokasi strategis sekali. Sayang mungkin efek pandemik jd beberapa sisi bangunan tidka terawat.

"285.","Zainal Abidin","128","2019-12-30","4","Salah satu hotel yg memiliki akses langsung ke pantai Kuta tanpa harus menyebrang jalan , kamar dan tempat tidurnyanya besar, bersih dan nyaman, sarapan paginya banyak pilihan dari yg ringan sampai berat tersedia, untuk pastrynya maknyus rasanya. Kolam renangnya besar dan ada beberapa pilihan dari yg di depan pantai sampai yg berada di dalam hotel. Kekurangan yg ada hanya di kamar mandinya agak sempit dan showernya merepotkan Krn sdh agak rusak"
"286.","han gur","226","2021-12-30","4","Kamar besar dengan bathup. Kolam renang hanya 2 yg bisa dipakai, sarapan hanya nasi goreng mie goreng + 1 lauk, omelet, bubur ayam, roti, buah.

The guestrooms is at several building mass, and for some, it will quite confusing to get to the room. The breakfast menu is good, there's bar also here. And it is near the heart of Kuta road, so you can explore the neighboring cafe or bar just by walking."

Anda juga bisa bermain dengan ombak pantai atau hanya sekedar berjalan² di tepi pantai sambil menikmati indahnya suasana Pantai Kuta 😍🤩"
"291.","IRMA","721","2019-12-30","4","Hotel berbintang yang berada di pantai Kuta, hotelnya sangat luas dengan fasilitas yang lengkap, tamannya luas dan asri, terdapat 3 kolam renang, kamar kamarnya luas, bersih terawat dan nyaman, cuman kalau dapat kamar sisi belakang agak jauh juga dari lobby depan lumayan hitung hitung olahraga, stafnya ramah ramah dan cepat tanggap, cuma sayang menu sarapan ada yang kurang, beberapa kali sarapan tidak terlihat menu daging sapi maupun daging ayam dalam bentuk potongan hanya daging ayam yang disuwir suwir untuk bubur ayam kan tidak semua tamu turis asing, sekedar masukan saja karna hotel berbintang yang dibawah Grand Inna saja bisa sajikan. Untuk parkiran mobil luas, pelayanan waktu check in dan check out sangat baik dan cepat."

Pilihan menu untuk breakfast lumayan bervariasi. Lokasi strategis. Usulan saya supaya di tambah akses jalan naik / turun menggunakan kereta dorong bayi. Kebetulan anak ke-3 saya masih berusia 2 tahunan dan kemana-mana pakai baby stoller. saya agak kesulitan karena akses untuk baby stoller bisa dikatakan minim sekali.

We had a nice experience and in the night i couldn't sleep i was at the beach pool at 6am. The personal was already there and prepared everything for the Day. Even then they asked imediatly if i need something. Was impresive to see what they do when we normaly sleep in our beds and with all that work they still have time to bring me something to drink and also got some food. Ill always be happy to come back to this beatiful place! Sry for my bad english but i think anyone can understand why i love this place!"

The hotel had buffet breakfast with so many varieties of foods. I stayed at Deluxe Sea View Room, I can see the sunsets from this room. I recommend you to stay in this hotel because it’s near Ngurah Rai airport."
"303.","irfanfebrianto bona","17","2020-12-30","3","Datang saat pandemi di long weekend. Hotel dengan baik melakukan protocol kesehatan. Mulai dari jaga jarak di lobby, hingga penyediaan cek suhu dan hand santizer. Hotel jg memberikan 1 pcs masker scuba di kamar hotel. Kekecewaan muncul pada restaurantnya. Sajian breakfast disana benar benar hambar. Tidak ada rasanya. Ditambah lagi pegawai hotel kurang sigap membersihkan meja yang selesai di pakai tamu sebelumnya. Part yg membuat saya sangat tersinggung adalah saat saya check out dari hotel ingin menunggu santai di restaurantnya. Penerbangan jam 16.00. Saya memutuskan untuk santai sejenak sambil minum jus dan kopi di restoran HQ. Setelah order Pegawai dengan ketawa kecil berucap ini aja pak gak makan ingin saya rasanya melempar bantal biru yg ada di sofa. Cobalah diganti kalimatnya. Seperti menjelaskan ada menu favorit untuk makan siang. Mungkin pada mau coba. Tanpa lama2 disana saya minta bon menghampirinya yg sedang sibuk main handphone. Lebih baik cabut dari hotel dan menunggu di bandara. Ingat yah. Kami turis lokal. Saat pandemi kaya gini. Kami yang di harapkan, untuk menambah pendapatan/devisa pariwisata."

"306.","Moto 4nn4","58","2021-12-30","3","Actually hotel has a goo location.. In the corer of Kuta beach with trully Direct front access to the beach. While others hotels may claim in front of Kuta beach but mostlt will separate with asphalt road to cross before to thr beach. We order 2 room with connecting. access and the room is spacious. Even the appearance looks old dated but it has been renovated with modern furniture. What we like in the room they provie the real mini Sanyo refrigerator with ice cube maker. It mean we could create own ice cube then added in our drink. The real refrigerator also cooler our water bottle faster very nice. Hotel have 2 big pools. One main pool with fresh water and shade of building/tree give good place to soak. Another outdoor pool in front access of the beach so aftet from the beach then could plunge on the pool. The breakfast in the morning is not much in menus.Taste it good. But being big hotel with many guests especially in the recover time after pandemic time seem it lack of staff in the restaurant. No one atte d the dirty desk ex previous guest. We must move it ownself before we can use it. It is unfortunately durimg the peak time of some event. So many person keep smoking and polluted the fresh breeze of open air restaurant. We suggest manamegent could a separate area for event like this and do not mix with hotel guest. In the end the clean glass or cup is empty at all nd not provided so we use soup cup to make our coffee.. So this actualky nice budget hotel"

Kamarnya luas , minusnya kamar mandi bath tub nya terlihat kotor dan jadul , untuk pool nya juga banyak lumut habis renang badan ku banyak yg gatal, mungkin efek ppkm jd staff pada di liburkan . Untuk sarapan ya cuma nasi putih mie goreng dan nasi goreng mungkin jd budget hotel selama covid ntah klo hari hari biasa"
"308.","Indradeep Roy","799","2019-12-30","4","The hotel is just beside the main gate of Kuta beach making it a top class Location to stay. Importantly, it's about half an hour drive from the airport as well. If you want to stay in Kuta this hotel would be a good bet because of the proximity from Kuta beach' Legian street and Poppies road. All of these places are easily accessible by walk. There are lot of positives which I found it. Th check in was fast and smooth. The pool is excellent and you get 1 welcome drink every day at the pool. The rooms are spacious and the staff is quite friendly. I got a private balcony and it was quite nice sitting there and catching up on thoughts. All the rooms are non smoking thus you have to smoke in the balcony itself. The breakfast spread was pretty good and there are enough security personnel doing their duty diligently, however ensuring that guests who comes to meet you are not unnecessarily harassed in the name of security. The sight seeing options and the airport pick up and drop pricing was quite competitive which impressed me as well. I was actually quite impressed and would love to visit back again. A few of my suggestions to the hotel to work if possible. 1. The shower panel need to be checked. I mean the water jets out at the pace of knots which might hurt one if not careful. There should be an adjustment option to control the speed 2. A thorough check should be done before allocating rooms. The tea kettle in my room was dirty with sediments floating inside it. I had to call the room service to get it charged. While there was a delay in attending my request, however they provided me a brand new water kettle. 3. The tea bag provided was Jasmine tea. I mean we should have a better choice at least a breakfast tea would be really good. However, I would strongly recommend families staying I Bali to consider this hotel as its indeed very good and takes care of its guests."

"318.","Nathan","62","2017-12-30","3","We booked in the older section as the pictures looked ok but we lasted 10 minutes in the room before requesting an upgrade which we happily paid the difference for. Do yourself a favor and pay the little bit extra for the new section of the hotel when you book. The pool area by the beach was closed for renovations when we stayed so a little disappointed but there are 2 other spacious pools on the property. Breakfast was adequate. Location was great being close to the beach, shopping and many restaurants and warungs. The staff were attentive and friendly. Our flight home was late at night so the hotel offered to store our bags in a secure place until our transfer arrived."
"319.","Tanisa","85","2021-12-30","3","Good: - the bed is quite big - cozy room even tho its already quite old fashioned. - clean bathroom - strategic location between kuta square and kuta beachwalk. Cons: - i can only check in at 15.00 which is really frustating. - the waiting room is crowded cause the late check in. - the hotel is too big without may lift for customer. So sometimes i got lost when i am in hurry. - the breakfast is so so, it either fried rice, fried noodles with some fried egg. Not so many variations. - i think this hotel need more staff. - the hospitality isnt that great."

The 'rear' of this hotel has a pool for guests and also opens up to the famous Kuta beach lined with refreshment vendors, peddlers and massage ladies. Sit under the shade of a tree, enjoy an ice-cold Bintang while having your legs/feet massaged."

The buffet breakfast was chaotic with very little food labelled. The staff could not keep up with the demand for a lot of the food. Room service is delivered on a very convenient rolling table. The orders have been wrong both times and the food is average, but not terrible. The location of the hotel is amazing right near waterbo, Hardrock and lots of shops. Compared to other hotels of the same price it feels tired and disorganised, but the location helps make up for it."

"338.","David Kingsley","52","2022-12-30","3","The wife and I only stayed here for about 3 nights. Upon arrival, there was a rather large group checking in, but either they were set aside for us or they were checked in very quickly. Took about 15 minutes of waiting before we were tended to. Quite fast in my opinion. The bathroom that was available at check in didn't smell very pleasant. Like people didnt know how to aim whilst urinating. We were upgraded from garden view to pool view which was quite unexpected. The room was quite nice. There was some complimentary items. They gave more essentials even if we didn't ask for it when they cleaned the room. This is a plus in my opinion. I love not having to asl for more shampoo and the like. We were also provided with a nice little honeymoon note as well as a reasonably sizeable box of chocolate cookies that tasted quite nice. My complaint about this place is how many commoners there are here, and the lack of enforcement of mask and glove policy on the premesis. The commoners hardly wear masks, and when going to the breakfast buffet, they don't use the protective glove to retrieve their food. Considering we don't know who uses the rest room and doesn't wash their hands afterwards, this is kind of a disgusting though. The buffet attendants should be reprimanding the commoners and forcing them to wear the gloves. There's no shortage of rude smokers. Most of them sit upwind of everyone and then smokes like a choo choo train. Not pleasant. They should have a designated smoking area for these people that is located in a manner as to be downwind from other patrons at all times. The internet sucks. It's difficult to get a signal. Just like the FM7 in Jakarta, I am giving an automatic 3 stars for that. When you're a traveler, you expect reasonable access to Internet so you can conduct business or talk with family and friends in the homeland, and stay entertained as well. DO NOT... I REPEAT N. O. T. get your clothing washed here inless it is an absolute emergency. It's rediculously expensive. We needed to get our clothings washed, and decided upon a laundry washer somewhere around the corner. In total, I give 3 stars for bad internet, and refusal of the catering staff to enforce the mask and glove rule at the breakfast buffet. Overall, the staff that we encountered were quite nice. No complaints there. Suggestions to Grand Inna Kuta: 1) Install more wifi access points to allow a better connection to all the rooms. This isn't a tall task. They're easy to install. 2) Enforce the glove and mask rule. If a customer comes to the buffet, prevent them from touching the serving utensils until they glove up. Alternativelty, have the catering staff serve the food instead. This works just as well. 3) Designated smoking areas. Nobody likes a rude smoker... And there's more of them in Indonesia than respectful smokers."

"341.","Adi Perdana","162","2019-12-30","5","Hotel Gran Inna Kuta berada tepat di salah satu pojok jalan di kawasan Pantai Kuta. Secara akses dari Bandara I Gusti Ngurah Rai, bandara ini relatif dekat. Bila tidak macet, dari Bandara I Gusti Ngurah Rai ke Hotel Gran Inna Kuta dapat ditempuh kurang dari 20 menit. Akses ke pantai Kuta sangat dekat, karena posisinya memang berada bersisian dengan kawasan publik pantai Kuta. Dari kawasan pantai tersebut, kita dapat melihat pemandangan sunset bersama wisawatan lainnya. Selain itu sangat dengan dengan restoran dan toko swalayan. Sehingga membuat nyaman bila membutuhkan tempat makan dan keperluan pribadi. Fasilitas kolam renang juga memadai dan menyenangkan. Restoran cukup besar dan menyediakan makanan yang sangat beragam dan lezat."

Saat malam hari biasanya mereka mendirikan kedai utk dinner. Kamarnya juga luas dan ada balkonnya, balkon yang menghadap taman juga cukup oke."
"346.","bound2v","5","2022-12-30","1","Writing this review while in the hotel itself, this is the most pathetic hotel you can book in bali. No response from reception if you complain for anything. Even if you visit the reception physically then also they won’t do anything. WiFi is absolutely disgusting so you end up having no connection at all. So many rooms lined up here you feel like a hostel which has no maintenance at all. I rarely write reviews but this hotel forced me to do so. BIG AVOID!!"
"347.","Danis","258","2023-12-30","5","We had a great time here at grand Inna.They have three pool.The pool facing the sea is like a lap pool Sadly they should have fixed the tiles during the Covid times . Services 5 stars from all the staff.Very friendly ,polite and kind.We like to also say thank you to Ms Intan a waitress at our breakfast restaurant.He memory was very excellent.After the first day we met her she remembered all our drinks with sugar no sugar for the rest of our stay.She is also very polite and always smiling like most of them. etc .well done Intan.Thank you Grand Inna.Lastly best used Blue Bird Company taxis around Indonesia, taxi from airport or get a Grab Maximum to hotel at Kuta beach is Rupiah 100,000.If you book a cab from the airport counter they will charge you 200,000 to 250,000 Rupiah"

"351.","Matthew (Louis)","13","2023-12-30","1","I am currently staying in the Truntum Kuta Hotel. The reason why I have selected this hotel is because of it's location. However, I noticed the given towers always with bad smell and on 10-Dec-2023, there is a marriage function at night. It is 10:36pm now and the music played by the marriage function is so loud until it affected my son's sleeping hour. I sincerely hope the hotel can look into the above 2 serious issues."

"354.","Jo Geary","4","2019-12-30","1","I have been staying at the Grand Inna Kuta for 19 years. This trip we had a party of 18. I have never had a complaint until this year. The staff are very lovely. We stayed in the pool access rooms. One of the rooms which my brother & his wife had was appalling. The room was full of mould & every day they requested for it to be cleaned. My sisters-in-law ended up in hospital due to these conditions. Unfortunately with their travel insurance they had to pay the first $250 & that is what the hospital bill was. I approached the manager regarding this & asking as it was the fault of the rooms condition that they reimburse their $250 to which I was told no they don’t give refunds. I spoke to a couple of people around the pool to find out that there was a party of 10 in their group & they also had bad rooms. I was told on leaving that the rooms are to be upgraded in January. These rooms should NEVER have been used. Every time we stay here it has always been with a group, unfortunately we won’t be staying here again. Very disappointed Grand Inna, you should really look after your loyal customers as we have done when we come to Bali. I wouldn’t even give it a one star but it I didn’t it won’t let me post this."
"355.","aime xoxo","58","2019-12-30","5","A very nice hotel with warm and nice staff. It is located beside the Kuta Beach, near Kuta Square and Beachwalk Mall. I must say this hotel is in a very strategic place. They have three swimming pools. The second one which is located a little bit behind the hotel is the nicest out of the three. They have trees around the pool. You can sun bathe under the trees. It has got the Bali vibes."

Seberang Hard rock . dan deket pintu masuk kawasan ke pantai. Banyak ditemukan patung kura2. Mungkin sangat erat hubungan nya dengan pelestarian kura2 atau Tukik di pantai Kuta. Kali ya. Tetapi secara umum hotelnya besrsih. Pelayanan bagian front office yang koperatif."

The breakfast options are endless and very delicious. Well maintained gardens and a very central location. Very close to the malls, markets, clubs and a step away from kuta beach. Bathroom was a little tired, could do with a little touch up. All the staff we came across were very friendly. Especially the barista Irene, what a lovely girl to talk to and such a friendly staff I met just before depating Bali."

"362.","Bennie P.","132","2022-12-30","3","Stay one night on the middle September 2022 in Seaview Room Don't know it yet this place will be my Bali worst 2022 or not cause I'm still on the trip and another 4 hotels on the way. But I can say they have only 2 nice things and they are location and hotel's scenery by garden and pool. My seaview room is outdated. All furniture seems they have been use since early 2000s. Everything simple like Ibis. From what I paid, I feel appointment and regret on my bad choice. 😅( was not so pricey so far, but I don't think this hotel worth that cost of room) Service.... My first experience with balineses who not already my friends started here. Security guys are nice, Bells are nice (not sure that truly nice but he saw me give big tip to my driver I guess) Receptions both check in and check out take act like I come to beg free room something.? Heard some rumor before travel here that Asean Travellers will be set as second class. It seems true now 😅 Do not trust my review tho. I spend only 14-15 hours there . I paid only small money ~ 100$ for a night stop before moving to Lambogan. No big expectations here. But still regret why I didn't pay a little more and go to Hard Rock or Sheraton?"

"364.","Benazir Fahim","42","2020-12-30","1","Sangat mengecewakan. Kamar dibersihkan namun tidak sempurna. Menu breakfast sangat sedikit dan tidak pernah diganti. Selain itu, rasa yang ditawarkan dari menu yang ada juga sangat buruk. Selama tiga hari, saya diberikan menu yang sama sampai saya bosan. Swimming pool hanya dibuka sampai jam 6 sore padahal saya sebelumnya menginap di beberapa hotel lain di Bali selama pandemi dan swimming pool bisa digunakan hingga larut malam. Pelayanan di restoran sangat buruk, tidak friendly. Saya bisa memastikan bahwa saya tidak akan pernah mengunjungi hotel ini kembali. Definitely not reccomended! Very disappointing. Rooms cleaned however not perfectly. The breakfast menu is minimal and never replaced. In addition, the taste offered from the menu is also very bad. For three days, I was given the same menu until I got bored. The swimming pool is only open until 6 pm even though I previously stayed at several other hotels in Bali during the pandemic and the swimming pool can be used until late at night. The service in the restaurant is very bad, not friendly. I can assure you that I will never visit this hotel again. Definitely not reccomended!"

My previous day experience Pathetic service , the rooms we booked after watching the pictures of room were not offered when we arrived . They have two buildings one with old rooms and one with new , old building doesn't even has a lift in it . They don't have a good service and try to make money out of everything whereas I stayed at different properties in Bali like holiday inn and all , they all offered such amazing services but this one was worse than pathetic .

Prepare to gasp for oxygen whilst drinking at the pool bar, relaxing by the pool and eating breakfast. Other than that, the breakfast is quite good, with a variety of meals to choose from. We stayed in an Interconnecting Family Room, the rooms were nice with comfortable bedding and pillows and standard bathroom. The multiple pools offered plenty of room to swim with the added bonus of kiddie pools at each! The TV system is appalling and the wifi generally overcrowded. I would suggest bringing a laptop with DVD player and HDMI output to access your own media etc"

"411.","Lili Suryani","8","2022-12-30","1","Teman-teman saya menginap di Grand Inna Kuta untuk liburan Natal. Sy mengunjungi mereka tgl 29 Desember malam. Disambut oleh seorang security yang sangat tidak ramah di bagian pintu masuk. Menginterogasi dan meminta KTP saya dengan sangat tidak ramah seakan-akan sy pelaku kejahatan (mungkin karena melihat sy dtg dgn mengendarai sepeda motor 🤷‍♀️), meskipun sy sudah mengatakan bahwa teman saya menginap disitu dan sebentar lg akan ke lobby utk menemui saya. Setelah teman saya datang, security tersebut langsung pergi begitu saja tanpa meminta maaf, dan justru security satunya (dari logat spt org Jawa) yang ramah dan merasa tdk enak terhadap sikap tmnnya yg mempersilahkan sy masuk. Saya mengerti tugas security untuk menjaga keamanan tp bukan berarti memperlakukan org yg dtg spt pelaku kejahatan. Kalian bekerja di hospitality, utamakan keramahan. Tolong pihak management untuk memperbaiki attitude staff-staffnya. Don't judge the book by it's cover, meskipun yg dtg menggunakan sepeda motor dan bukan mobil, tidak berarti boleh diperlakukan dgn tidak ramah."
"412.","Taariq Hassim","61","2019-12-30","3","The good: The hotel facilities are amazing. 3 pools, 1 on the beach front. Free towel usage. Free photography coupon on arrival. Free WiFi. There are a lot of amenities. Great buffet breakfast. It's close to a lot of great shops and restaurants. Definitely top points on location.The Superior room beds are quite nice. And bonus points for having an ice tray and compartment in the fridge. The not so good: Service is better than what we have in our home country but they aren't as warm as what we experienced in Sanur. The free WiFi is slow at best. Taxis are available just outside the hotel, however they cost a premium. Recommend walking just outside the hotel for a 30-40% price drop. Finally, you don't want to spend too much time in the room. Temperamental aircon, tiny TVs with not great reception, a bit of a dark ambiance, comparatively small bathrooms and plug points in not so ideal spots. Recommend they start revamping and modernizing. The rooms are outdated and not user friendly. Oh, additional sound proofing would be nice. Loud neighbors can be annoying too."

"424.","Susan Rollins","9","2019-12-30","1","My driver said this was a fancy hotel. It might once have been. It was full of old grandeur, with a focus on old. The door to my room was wooden, and the panels had cracks you could see through. Anything metal was rusted, the toilet was leaking on the bathroom floor, the bathroom mirror had a crack the length of it, and the AC didn't work. They did provide toiletries and a free mini bar of soda, but there were no washcloths to be found. It is right on the beach, so that might be enough of a draw for some people to overlook the obvious neglect of the property, but not me. I ended up checking out without staying the night."

"428.","pandu dirgantara","42","2021-12-30","4","Waktu kemarin ke Bali, saat di daerah Kuta, saya dan tim berdiskusi dan memutuskan, bahwa meski sangat sangat kecil kontribusi, tp kami ttp harus menssuport dunia pariwisata Indonesia. Yaitu dengan cara merepotkan diri, menginap di daerah Bali berpindah pindah tiap malam. Satu malam, kami memutuskan menginap di Grand Inna. Sepakat yg dengan reviewer yg mengatakan hotel ini old, tapi keramahan staf disini luar biasa. Makanan below average indeed, tp no problem saya masih bisa mencari makan diluar.

Especially with Photo booth at their hotel and Duty managers in line who hardly assist in resolving any disputes deriving as a result from lies ( to loot money) from photo booth counter at their hotel. Even though in line duty managers were briefed about this issue as this just not only make our experience horrible but also damage international reputation of Grand Inn Kuta, but they were not interested and refused to assist us to resolve this issue and told us directly to review anything about Grand Inn Kuta. This was the first time ever i heard such a disrespectful comment from a duty manager at a 4 star hotel anywhere."

The hospitality offered here is refreshing, the food is nice, and the ambience has a beach at its aid. Many shopping centers and entertainment options are at a feet’s distance.

I didn’t like the Check in receptionist and the way he answers the normal questions I asked... we came at 1 pm and I knew that check in should be 3 pm so I was planning to stay at the mall near by to waste time, when we came back for check in only one of the two rooms we booked was ready... They put us in the oldest room I’ve ever been to in my life. Furniture looks as old as I am. Looks like a poor maintenance after all. Unfortunately. I booked this hotel for 4 nights non refundable otherwise I wouldn’t even check in after I saw the rooms. Rooms are like 1 star motel not worth the money... still didn’t check the breakfast yet as this is our first night... but after this experience it’s a serious heart breaking. Hope it won’t ruin our vacation..."

"466.","Kiki","70","2019-12-30","2","Pros and some strong cons to this place. The rooms we're average. Bathrooms need some work. The cocktail lists by the pool were unexciting. Ran out of cocktail ingredients, radlers and cokes at the beach pool and when we asked if they could go get some from another bar, waitress said no but we can go get ourselves. Also was uncompensated for miscommunication on their end when trying to book a shuttle from airport, them saying the email went into spam and it wasn't their fault nobody replied to us. Would not come back to the hotel."

While there is ongoing maintenance it is not sufficient to keep pace with the scale of the work needed in a hotel of this size. Much of the hotel appears abandoned which is not what I expected. Various decks and levels have fallen into disuse and neglect. While the current team in service is working hard to keep this grand old dame running... they are insufficient to the task. Posting a pic of one of the disused/abandoned areas. While I agree that it may be surplus to need. Allowing it to fall into disrepair doesn't speak well of the general maintenance"

"498.","Milton Kilgour","105","2017-12-30","1","This must be one of the worst 4* Hotels I have stayed in my life! And I've traveled to over 30 Countries. Its reminds me of the tv program Hotels from Hell! The best thing was arriving with a warm greeting. From there it was all downhill! From the welcome drink voucher which wasn't, only green tea offered so I paid for an orange juice which was filled with pulp & pips that blocked the straw, to waiting for over 20 mins for 1 serving of fries which I ended up canceling. Then getting to our room which smelt damp to discover it was infested with mosquitoes, after killing 8 we called housekeeping for a can of spray, well that just upset the rest of them & we bailed out before being eaten alive plus getting no wifi reception. After expressing our disappointment to the service manager we were told there was only 1 other room available in the whole place. So we went for a look, with only finding 4 mozzies in this one & luckily it didn't smell as bad as the first, we agreed to change rooms for the night then proceeded to fumigate the room personally before bailing out for dinner down the road. As my photos show, it's more like a 2* hotel & how it got a 4* rating I will never know? There are mouldy and poorly fitted lights & switches, the walls & ceiling are patchy & mouldy & have spider webs, even the wall socket doesn't work! Today they are moving us to their new wing so we are hoping it is to a better standard. I was very close to changing hotels but the service manager assures me we will be much happier in their ocean front room in a new wing. So my advice is do not stay at the Grand Inna Kuta or you too will be very disappointed with your stay if not get malaria! I carefully researched this place but it goes to show that tourists can be easily mislead with online reviews! Their photos looked great! Now moved to better room but still stains on pillow cases and not to standard. Check out the seaview photos...lol, cleaning the roof might help the outlook."

Breakfast was good, theres so much food variation, from lokal, western, ect. Price was more expensive than the others. Probably because it's strategic location. One shortcomings, you have to pay 500.000IDR / 50USD deposit. It's will be refunded upon check out. it would be better if the policy was omitted"

"534.","Rebekah Hansen","28","2018-12-30","1","Rooms smelled like mould. Had to change rooms 2 times to get one that smelled 1/2 decent and buy an air freshener. Breakfast was good but with the price you're paying that's to be expected. Pools big but areas and furniture all run down. Sun deck rotted so bad there are massive whole in the decking, not very safe at all, especially for children. Hidden charges on check out approx. $85 AUD was an annoying end to a very average stay. Typical Bali money grabbing scamming. When I asked to speak to the GM they brought me the Office Manager (Rodiyana) as the GM was in meeting. When I asked Rodiyana about these hidden fees and charges he replied with they are not hidden we just don't tell our guest unless they ask. He also admitted that many times they have this dispute with guest upon check out but they will just pay it. You have too were his exact words, how disgusting! But he did agreed that their Don't ask, don't tell policy on this matter is ethically wrong then finished off with But have to pay, called for security and walked away. I asked to speak to the GM again and they brought me the Room Division Manager Yemi who once again wasted more of our time and spinning a different story of how we are the 1st guest to ever question these hidden charges and that I couldn't talk to the GM as he is at the airport picking up guests and could be 2-3 hours. Yeah ok, the hotel General Manager (Ben) is at Denpasar airport waiting with all the other drivers, holding a sign, picking up guest. While the hotel transfer drivers are sitting here doing nothing. If you are looking to stay here I suggest you take a look at Bali Garden Beach Resort, its around the same price but a million times better in all aspects. Plus far better quality and prices on food, drinks and spa treatments. For the money you pay to stay here there is definitely much better in Bali and Kuta. Update: In response to your reply we did call down to reception & enquire on making a call to Australia as there was something urgent we needed to attend to. Not once were told it was $4 a minute & your Office Manager said that was because we did not specify ask How much does it cost? I guess we we're given a false sense of security with being told, in that same enquiry call, that an international call is bit more but not much more, No one once told us not much more meant $4 AUD a min. And this didn't seem to be information the receptionists or Office manager knew when we went to check out either. It took both the receptionist and office manager a good 5 mins to find out that figure so I guess that was all just to hard for someone to do when we made our initial enquiry call down to the front desk. But when it comes down to it, it's not about the money it's about the principal. Your front desk gave very misleading information & acted very dumb when we got down there. Your Office manager admitted it's a don't ask don't tell policy and he too agreed it was ethically wrong. So maybe that's your hotel policy to try a weasel an extra buck from your guests or maybe your front desk staff are undertrained & the female we spoke to that morning was too lazy to find out. Either way, even without that last issue at the end. Your decks are still rotting with big gaping holes, the rooms smell like mould & have loads of baby cockroaches inhabiting them, probably because the daily room clean are very poor, we were given wrong billing at not only twice at the pool bar but also at the restaurant (lucky we checked) and quite frankly the hotel is run down and you know it. That's probably why you're resorting to scamming your guest. Like I said for the amount you're charging a night, there is far far better quality and value for money in Bali and Kuta. We decided by day 2 of our 6 night stay that we would not stay there again. And maybe instead of trying to defend and minimise all your short comings as a 4 star hotel you should take a little something on board. Look at Bali Garden compared to Grand Inna, same pricing, same location, 2 very different levels of quality and service."

Do yourself a favor and pay the little bit extra for the new section of the hotel when you book. The pool area by the beach was closed for renovations when we stayed so a little disappointed but there are 2 other spacious pools on the property. Breakfast was adequate. Location was great being close to the beach, shopping and many restaurants and warungs. The staff were attentive and friendly. Our flight home was late at night so the hotel offered to store our bags in a secure place until our transfer arrived."

So sometimes i got lost when i am in hurry. - the breakfast is so so, it either fried rice, fried noodles with some fried egg. Not so many variations. - i think this hotel need more staff. - the hospitality isnt that great."

The Deluxe rooms are more expensive and promoted as more luxurieus, but in my opinion the Superior rooms are nicer."

Visited Bali with family ( wife & kid) in January 2020 , just before covid break out. Enjoyed our time at this hotel. Bali is beautiful place to visit & Bali people are very friendly. Planning to visit again once covid is over."

"588.","Ivan DSouza","66","2020-01-13","5","Fantastic place to stay in Kuta. Good location, clean and spacious rooms, 4 swimming pools, very polite & helpful staff, and good food, especially in the evening when they set up a 'street like' food area within the hotel grounds at great prices. The 'rear' of this hotel has a pool for guests and also opens up to the famous Kuta beach lined with refreshment vendors, peddlers and massage ladies. Sit under the shade of a tree, enjoy an ice-cold Bintang while having your legs/feet massaged."

Saya mendapatkan kamar dilantai 1..mungkin kecoa2 lewat pembuangan dikamar mandi. Selama pandemi chanel tv jg cuma tv lokal saja.

"591.","Luke Oakley","25","2018-01-13","3","The staff are pleasant and the hotel is generally kept clean. The pools and gardens are well maintained and nice. The buffet breakfast was chaotic with very little food labelled. The staff could not keep up with the demand for a lot of the food. Room service is delivered on a very convenient rolling table. The orders have been wrong both times and the food is average, but not terrible. The location of the hotel is amazing right near waterbo, Hardrock and lots of shops. Compared to other hotels of the same price it feels tired and disorganised, but the location helps make up for it."

"595.","David Kingsley","52","2022-01-13","3","The wife and I only stayed here for about 3 nights. Upon arrival, there was a rather large group checking in, but either they were set aside for us or they were checked in very quickly. Took about 15 minutes of waiting before we were tended to. Quite fast in my opinion. The bathroom that was available at check in didn't smell very pleasant. Like people didnt know how to aim whilst urinating. We were upgraded from garden view to pool view which was quite unexpected. The room was quite nice. There was some complimentary items. They gave more essentials even if we didn't ask for it when they cleaned the room. This is a plus in my opinion. I love not having to asl for more shampoo and the like. We were also provided with a nice little honeymoon note as well as a reasonably sizeable box of chocolate cookies that tasted quite nice. My complaint about this place is how many commoners there are here, and the lack of enforcement of mask and glove policy on the premesis. The commoners hardly wear masks, and when going to the breakfast buffet, they don't use the protective glove to retrieve their food. Considering we don't know who uses the rest room and doesn't wash their hands afterwards, this is kind of a disgusting though. The buffet attendants should be reprimanding the commoners and forcing them to wear the gloves. There's no shortage of rude smokers. Most of them sit upwind of everyone and then smokes like a choo choo train. Not pleasant. They should have a designated smoking area for these people that is located in a manner as to be downwind from other patrons at all times. The internet sucks. It's difficult to get a signal. Just like the FM7 in Jakarta, I am giving an automatic 3 stars for that. When you're a traveler, you expect reasonable access to Internet so you can conduct business or talk with family and friends in the homeland, and stay entertained as well. DO NOT... I REPEAT N. O. T. get your clothing washed here inless it is an absolute emergency. It's rediculously expensive. We needed to get our clothings washed, and decided upon a laundry washer somewhere around the corner. In total, I give 3 stars for bad internet, and refusal of the catering staff to enforce the mask and glove rule at the breakfast buffet. Overall, the staff that we encountered were quite nice. No complaints there. Suggestions to Grand Inna Kuta: 1) Install more wifi access points to allow a better connection to all the rooms. This isn't a tall task. They're easy to install. 2) Enforce the glove and mask rule. If a customer comes to the buffet, prevent them from touching the serving utensils until they glove up. Alternativelty, have the catering staff serve the food instead. This works just as well. 3) Designated smoking areas. Nobody likes a rude smoker... And there's more of them in Indonesia than respectful smokers."

"598.","Adi Perdana","162","2020-01-13","5","Hotel Gran Inna Kuta berada tepat di salah satu pojok jalan di kawasan Pantai Kuta. Secara akses dari Bandara I Gusti Ngurah Rai, bandara ini relatif dekat. Bila tidak macet, dari Bandara I Gusti Ngurah Rai ke Hotel Gran Inna Kuta dapat ditempuh kurang dari 20 menit. Akses ke pantai Kuta sangat dekat, karena posisinya memang berada bersisian dengan kawasan publik pantai Kuta. Dari kawasan pantai tersebut, kita dapat melihat pemandangan sunset bersama wisawatan lainnya. Selain itu sangat dengan dengan restoran dan toko swalayan. Sehingga membuat nyaman bila membutuhkan tempat makan dan keperluan pribadi. Fasilitas kolam renang juga memadai dan menyenangkan. Restoran cukup besar dan menyediakan makanan yang sangat beragam dan lezat."

"604.","bound2v","5","2023-01-13","1","Writing this review while in the hotel itself, this is the most pathetic hotel you can book in bali. No response from reception if you complain for anything. Even if you visit the reception physically then also they won’t do anything. WiFi is absolutely disgusting so you end up having no connection at all. So many rooms lined up here you feel like a hostel which has no maintenance at all. I rarely write reviews but this hotel forced me to do so. BIG AVOID!!"

"610.","Jo Geary","4","2020-01-13","1","I have been staying at the Grand Inna Kuta for 19 years. This trip we had a party of 18. I have never had a complaint until this year. The staff are very lovely. We stayed in the pool access rooms. One of the rooms which my brother & his wife had was appalling. The room was full of mould & every day they requested for it to be cleaned. My sisters-in-law ended up in hospital due to these conditions. Unfortunately with their travel insurance they had to pay the first $250 & that is what the hospital bill was. I approached the manager regarding this & asking as it was the fault of the rooms condition that they reimburse their $250 to which I was told no they don’t give refunds. I spoke to a couple of people around the pool to find out that there was a party of 10 in their group & they also had bad rooms. I was told on leaving that the rooms are to be upgraded in January. These rooms should NEVER have been used. Every time we stay here it has always been with a group, unfortunately we won’t be staying here again. Very disappointed Grand Inna, you should really look after your loyal customers as we have done when we come to Bali. I wouldn’t even give it a one star but it I didn’t it won’t let me post this."
"611.","aime xoxo","58","2020-01-13","5","A very nice hotel with warm and nice staff. It is located beside the Kuta Beach, near Kuta Square and Beachwalk Mall. I must say this hotel is in a very strategic place. They have three swimming pools. The second one which is located a little bit behind the hotel is the nicest out of the three. They have trees around the pool. You can sun bathe under the trees. It has got the Bali vibes."

But I can say they have only 2 nice things and they are location and hotel's scenery by garden and pool. My seaview room is outdated. All furniture seems they have been use since early 2000s. Everything simple like Ibis. From what I paid, I feel appointment and regret on my bad choice. 😅( was not so pricey so far, but I don't think this hotel worth that cost of room) Service.... My first experience with balineses who not already my friends started here. Security guys are nice, Bells are nice (not sure that truly nice but he saw me give big tip to my driver I guess) Receptions both check in and check out take act like I come to beg free room something.? Heard some rumor before travel here that Asean Travellers will be set as second class. It seems true now 😅 Do not trust my review tho. I spend only 14-15 hours there . I paid only small money ~ 100$ for a night stop before moving to Lambogan. No big expectations here. But still regret why I didn't pay a little more and go to Hard Rock or Sheraton?"

Selain itu, rasa yang ditawarkan dari menu yang ada juga sangat buruk. Selama tiga hari, saya diberikan menu yang sama sampai saya bosan. Swimming pool hanya dibuka sampai jam 6 sore padahal saya sebelumnya menginap di beberapa hotel lain di Bali selama pandemi dan swimming pool bisa digunakan hingga larut malam. Pelayanan di restoran sangat buruk, tidak friendly. Saya bisa memastikan bahwa saya tidak akan pernah mengunjungi hotel ini kembali. Definitely not reccomended! Very disappointing. Rooms cleaned however not perfectly. The breakfast menu is minimal and never replaced. In addition, the taste offered from the menu is also very bad. For three days, I was given the same menu until I got bored. The swimming pool is only open until 6 pm even though I previously stayed at several other hotels in Bali during the pandemic and the swimming pool can be used until late at night. The service in the restaurant is very bad, not friendly. I can assure you that I will never visit this hotel again. Definitely not reccomended!"

"654.","Liman Hadi","106","2019-01-13","5","Hotel Grand Inna Kuta lokasinya depan pantai Kuta, bersebelahan dengan Hard Rock dan Kuta Square. KFC, Wendys, dan Beachwalk mall berada dekat dengan hotelnya. Kalau ingin menikmati keramaian Kuta Bali menginap di sini merupakan salah satu tempat yang nyaman, karena hotel tidak jauh dari banyak tempat menarik di sekitar hotel. Untuk hotelnya, kamar cukup luas, ranjang nyaman, tempat berenang ada beberapa lokasi di hotel jadi sangat menyenangkan. Untuk breakfast cukup enak banyak variasinya."
"655.","Nauli Simanjuntak","105","2019-01-13","4","Strategic location near the beach, just walk! Great pool,they have 3 pools. Kids playroom open 9 am - 7 pm near Sunken pool but its to small room thou. Friendly staff, but i experience they prefer to serve the foreigner first in HQ restaurant during breakfast, while I had queue first. Dissapointing. Hope staff can serve equally no matter what nationality are."

Lokasi hotel sangat strategis , bersebelahan dengan Pantai Kuta , dekat dengan Bandara Ngurah Rai, dan beberapa shopping mall . Fasilitas hotel yg ditawarkan juga sangat lengkap mulai dari pool ada 3 pool , pilihan kamar pun ada 2 pilihan Bali wing (didesain dengan atmosfir lokal khas Bali ) & Beach wing (didesain dengan atmosfir yg lebih modern) , restaurant dengan 3 alternatif pilihan tempat ( HQ , Bali Breeze dan Warung Senggol GIK) dan beberapa aktivitas yang sangat menarik yg mereka tawarkan selama menginap disana. Grand Inna Kuta juga menawarkan afternoon tea mulai dari harga 100K dengan pilihan snack yg beragam. Satu paket lengkap banget kalau menginap di Grand Inna Kuta."

"664.","Rohit Iyer","23","2020-01-13","5","Probably one of the best beach side hotels in kuta with a very supportive staff, A wonderful cultural architecture of the place, brilliant breakfast, spacious pool, cost effective room service. Enjoyed my stay. Only issue I believe is the locality. Not many options to eat from here."
"665.","Gabriela Lengkong","146","2019-01-13","5","Hotel favorit di pantai Kuta! Lokasi terbaik di Kuta karena pas di pojokan, kemana-mana dekat bisa jalan kaki saja. Dari hotel bisa langsung ke pantai tanpa harus menyeberang jalanan sehingga lebih aman bagi keluarga yang berlibur bersama anak-anak. Lobinya sangat bagus dan mewah. Kamarnya nyaman dan tenang. Kami bisa tidur dengan nyenyak."

"668.","J H","226","2019-01-13","2","Location wise is awesome but the quality of the room is not that great compare other 4 star standard hotel. Price is normal if booking in advance. Personally i won't recommend this hotel as best place to stay unless if there is no options. If you are looking for location, this hotel might be a good option otherwise better for other hotel with similar or same price."
"669.","Lili Suryani","8","2023-01-13","1","Teman-teman saya menginap di Grand Inna Kuta untuk liburan Natal. Sy mengunjungi mereka tgl 29 Desember malam. Disambut oleh seorang security yang sangat tidak ramah di bagian pintu masuk. Menginterogasi dan meminta KTP saya dengan sangat tidak ramah seakan-akan sy pelaku kejahatan (mungkin karena melihat sy dtg dgn mengendarai sepeda motor 🤷‍♀️), meskipun sy sudah mengatakan bahwa teman saya menginap disitu dan sebentar lg akan ke lobby utk menemui saya. Setelah teman saya datang, security tersebut langsung pergi begitu saja tanpa meminta maaf, dan justru security satunya (dari logat spt org Jawa) yang ramah dan merasa tdk enak terhadap sikap tmnnya yg mempersilahkan sy masuk. Saya mengerti tugas security untuk menjaga keamanan tp bukan berarti memperlakukan org yg dtg spt pelaku kejahatan. Kalian bekerja di hospitality, utamakan keramahan. Tolong pihak management untuk memperbaiki attitude staff-staffnya. Don't judge the book by it's cover, meskipun yg dtg menggunakan sepeda motor dan bukan mobil, tidak berarti boleh diperlakukan dgn tidak ramah."
"670.","Taariq Hassim","61","2020-01-13","3","The good: The hotel facilities are amazing. 3 pools, 1 on the beach front. Free towel usage. Free photography coupon on arrival. Free WiFi. There are a lot of amenities. Great buffet breakfast. It's close to a lot of great shops and restaurants. Definitely top points on location.The Superior room beds are quite nice. And bonus points for having an ice tray and compartment in the fridge. The not so good: Service is better than what we have in our home country but they aren't as warm as what we experienced in Sanur. The free WiFi is slow at best. Taxis are available just outside the hotel, however they cost a premium. Recommend walking just outside the hotel for a 30-40% price drop. Finally, you don't want to spend too much time in the room. Temperamental aircon, tiny TVs with not great reception, a bit of a dark ambiance, comparatively small bathrooms and plug points in not so ideal spots. Recommend they start revamping and modernizing. The rooms are outdated and not user friendly. Oh, additional sound proofing would be nice. Loud neighbors can be annoying too."

"683.","Susan Rollins","9","2020-01-13","1","My driver said this was a fancy hotel. It might once have been. It was full of old grandeur, with a focus on old. The door to my room was wooden, and the panels had cracks you could see through. Anything metal was rusted, the toilet was leaking on the bathroom floor, the bathroom mirror had a crack the length of it, and the AC didn't work. They did provide toiletries and a free mini bar of soda, but there were no washcloths to be found. It is right on the beach, so that might be enough of a draw for some people to overlook the obvious neglect of the property, but not me. I ended up checking out without staying the night."

Even though in line duty managers were briefed about this issue as this just not only make our experience horrible but also damage international reputation of Grand Inn Kuta, but they were not interested and refused to assist us to resolve this issue and told us directly to review anything about Grand Inn Kuta.

I didn’t like the Check in receptionist and the way he answers the normal questions I asked... we came at 1 pm and I knew that check in should be 3 pm so I was planning to stay at the mall near by to waste time, when we came back for check in only one of the two rooms we booked was ready... They put us in the oldest room I’ve ever been to in my life. Furniture looks as old as I am. Looks like a poor maintenance after all. Unfortunately. I booked this hotel for 4 nights non refundable otherwise I wouldn’t even check in after I saw the rooms. Rooms are like 1 star motel not worth the money... still didn’t check the breakfast yet as this is our first night... but after this experience it’s a serious heart breaking. Hope it won’t ruin our vacation..."

Ran out of cocktail ingredients, radlers and cokes at the beach pool and when we asked if they could go get some from another bar, waitress said no but we can go get ourselves. Also was uncompensated for miscommunication on their end when trying to book a shuttle from airport, them saying the email went into spam and it wasn't their fault nobody replied to us. Would not come back to the hotel."

Everything is within walking distance with numerous restaurants in and around the hotel including Jaime Oliver's Italian Restaurant. They have 3 pools THREE POOOLS WHAAAAA. Very good will definitely be staying here next time. But to note, if you're looking for peace and quiet this is not the place to be Kuta is very touristy and the people harass you to buy things but would recommend Ubud. Other than that, you can surf by the infamous beach of Kuta or see the turtle reserve that is right next door."

Yaitu dengan cara merepotkan diri, menginap di daerah Bali berpindah pindah tiap malam. Satu malam, kami memutuskan menginap di Grand Inna. Sepakat yg dengan reviewer yg mengatakan hotel ini old, tapi keramahan staf disini luar biasa. Makanan below average indeed, tp no problem saya masih bisa mencari makan diluar.

While there is ongoing maintenance it is not sufficient to keep pace with the scale of the work needed in a hotel of this size. Much of the hotel appears abandoned which is not what I expected. Various decks and levels have fallen into disuse and neglect. While the current team in service is working hard to keep this grand old dame running... they are insufficient to the task. Posting a pic of one of the disused/abandoned areas. While I agree that it may be surplus to need. Allowing it to fall into disrepair doesn't speak well of the general maintenance"

"758.","Milton Kilgour","105","2018-01-13","1","This must be one of the worst 4* Hotels I have stayed in my life! And I've traveled to over 30 Countries. Its reminds me of the tv program Hotels from Hell! The best thing was arriving with a warm greeting. From there it was all downhill! From the welcome drink voucher which wasn't, only green tea offered so I paid for an orange juice which was filled with pulp & pips that blocked the straw, to waiting for over 20 mins for 1 serving of fries which I ended up canceling. Then getting to our room which smelt damp to discover it was infested with mosquitoes, after killing 8 we called housekeeping for a can of spray, well that just upset the rest of them & we bailed out before being eaten alive plus getting no wifi reception. After expressing our disappointment to the service manager we were told there was only 1 other room available in the whole place. So we went for a look, with only finding 4 mozzies in this one & luckily it didn't smell as bad as the first, we agreed to change rooms for the night then proceeded to fumigate the room personally before bailing out for dinner down the road. As my photos show, it's more like a 2* hotel & how it got a 4* rating I will never know? There are mouldy and poorly fitted lights & switches, the walls & ceiling are patchy & mouldy & have spider webs, even the wall socket doesn't work! Today they are moving us to their new wing so we are hoping it is to a better standard. I was very close to changing hotels but the service manager assures me we will be much happier in their ocean front room in a new wing. So my advice is do not stay at the Grand Inna Kuta or you too will be very disappointed with your stay if not get malaria! I carefully researched this place but it goes to show that tourists can be easily mislead with online reviews! Their photos looked great! Now moved to better room but still stains on pillow cases and not to standard. Check out the seaview photos...lol, cleaning the roof might help the outlook."

"794.","Rebekah Hansen","28","2019-01-13","1","Rooms smelled like mould. Had to change rooms 2 times to get one that smelled 1/2 decent and buy an air freshener. Breakfast was good but with the price you're paying that's to be expected. Pools big but areas and furniture all run down. Sun deck rotted so bad there are massive whole in the decking, not very safe at all, especially for children. Hidden charges on check out approx. $85 AUD was an annoying end to a very average stay. Typical Bali money grabbing scamming. When I asked to speak to the GM they brought me the Office Manager (Rodiyana) as the GM was in meeting. When I asked Rodiyana about these hidden fees and charges he replied with they are not hidden we just don't tell our guest unless they ask. He also admitted that many times they have this dispute with guest upon check out but they will just pay it. You have too were his exact words, how disgusting! But he did agreed that their Don't ask, don't tell policy on this matter is ethically wrong then finished off with But have to pay, called for security and walked away. I asked to speak to the GM again and they brought me the Room Division Manager Yemi who once again wasted more of our time and spinning a different story of how we are the 1st guest to ever question these hidden charges and that I couldn't talk to the GM as he is at the airport picking up guests and could be 2-3 hours. Yeah ok, the hotel General Manager (Ben) is at Denpasar airport waiting with all the other drivers, holding a sign, picking up guest. While the hotel transfer drivers are sitting here doing nothing. If you are looking to stay here I suggest you take a look at Bali Garden Beach Resort, its around the same price but a million times better in all aspects. Plus far better quality and prices on food, drinks and spa treatments. For the money you pay to stay here there is definitely much better in Bali and Kuta. Update: In response to your reply we did call down to reception & enquire on making a call to Australia as there was something urgent we needed to attend to. Not once were told it was $4 a minute & your Office Manager said that was because we did not specify ask How much does it cost? I guess we we're given a false sense of security with being told, in that same enquiry call, that an international call is bit more but not much more, No one once told us not much more meant $4 AUD a min. And this didn't seem to be information the receptionists or Office manager knew when we went to check out either. It took both the receptionist and office manager a good 5 mins to find out that figure so I guess that was all just to hard for someone to do when we made our initial enquiry call down to the front desk. But when it comes down to it, it's not about the money it's about the principal. Your front desk gave very misleading information & acted very dumb when we got down there. Your Office manager admitted it's a don't ask don't tell policy and he too agreed it was ethically wrong. So maybe that's your hotel policy to try a weasel an extra buck from your guests or maybe your front desk staff are undertrained & the female we spoke to that morning was too lazy to find out. Either way, even without that last issue at the end. Your decks are still rotting with big gaping holes, the rooms smell like mould & have loads of baby cockroaches inhabiting them, probably because the daily room clean are very poor, we were given wrong billing at not only twice at the pool bar but also at the restaurant (lucky we checked) and quite frankly the hotel is run down and you know it. That's probably why you're resorting to scamming your guest. Like I said for the amount you're charging a night, there is far far better quality and value for money in Bali and Kuta. We decided by day 2 of our 6 night stay that we would not stay there again. And maybe instead of trying to defend and minimise all your short comings as a 4 star hotel you should take a little something on board. Look at Bali Garden compared to Grand Inna, same pricing, same location, 2 very different levels of quality and service."

"811.","網男（醫美孖八）","8","2018-01-13","3","Bad points: (1) beach front pool suddenly undergo renovation till end of May 2017 while the management just give 5 day prior notice. (2) breakfast restaurant just overlooking the renovation site with noise & dust starting at 9am rather than hearing the sound from sea waves (3) Old wing (Bali wing) is at most a three star hotel, no better than Yilia Beach Inn which is 100M nearby and cost just half the price. (4) The Sunken pool at old wing is very hot and lack shades (5) Superior pool view room just got a small concrete balcony & it's not pleasant to sit outside (6) The room got not enough illumination especial in the bathroom over the mirror side (7) The connecting room at the end of the corridor has two interconnecting doors on both side of the room which are thin and you can hear the neighboring guest's coughing and talking. (8) Shower area has no glass door and the shower curtain is too short to prevent flooding the floor of the bathroom (9) the main door in the connecting room has no security hole (10) the wifi connection is not strong and steady with intermittent drop out (11) the corridor in Bali wing is like a sauna area as all the split type air conditioner unit are facing the patio, you will get more sweaty while walking to and from your room"

I let the front desk know & the Yani lady at the front was fantastic & was very understanding in 2 hours they upgraded us deluxe room.... it was prefect. They moved our bags from old room to new room. The bathroom was fantastic & had big shower. The beds were comfortable & the tv worked lol The staff are so lovely & friendly with a smile every time you walk past. The breakfast was good & great view off the ocean while eating breakfast. The pools are great, only thing that annoyed me is other guest would leave towels on beds, walk off & come back a few hours later to use.. it’s little unfair for other guest.. pool manager should remove towels after 30mins after no use, so it’s gives the other guest a chance to relax by pool. The location is fantastic it’s so close to everything & so close to the beach. Only little pain catch a taxi you have to go around how long way to airport or Seminyak.. it’s gets busy too. We will be back & thank you for a memorable stay”"

There are convenience stores near the hotel open 24hrs. There are some traditional massage outside under Rp. 100k/US$9.

The hotel refused to take responsibility. The breakfast was awful! Food at the restaurant average. I have never found staff as unhelpful as at this hotel. It is overpriced and there are much better resorts for the same money."
"900.","Candice Chalmers","19","2025-07-20","1","We’re a young family who have travelled to Bali for years, and our recent stay at Truntum Bali was incredibly disappointing. We were not told about the renovations happening on the side we expected to stay on, and the vibe throughout the resort felt tired and unwelcoming. From the moment we arrived, there were no smiles or greetings—something that’s so unlike the warm and friendly Bali we know and love. Even our kids, who usually love connecting with the Balinese people, didn’t feel that spark here. The food was well below standard. Breakfast was sub-par, the egg station was rarely manned, and the coffee was awful. Our room had dirty towels, a bathroom full of mosquitoes, and the laundry service was overpriced with poor quality results. Poolside was unpleasant too—staff constantly tried to sell us massages and hair braiding instead of creating a relaxing atmosphere. The staff in general didn’t seem happy, which speaks volumes about how the place is run. While the location is prime, there’s clearly no care factor. It feels like the staff aren't being looked after, and that trickles down into every part of the experience. We wouldn’t return—and that’s a shame, because Bali usually feels like home. Quality of furniture around pool and restaurant is in some serious need of replacing."

"905.","Tilly Ferguson","6","2025-01-20","1","This is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at, and I would strongly warn anyone against booking here! Upon arrival, we were told to wait 4 and a half hours before we could check into our rooms. To make matters worse, the rooms were absolutely disgusting—mould everywhere, making it clear they don’t prioritise basic hygiene or maintenance. The so-called “buffet breakfast” was a complete disaster. Food was left uncovered for hours on the beachfront and it’s no surprise that 7 members of my family got seriously unwell after eating it. We had to call 5 doctors, costing us over $1000, and we were all severely sick over New Year’s, ruining what was supposed to be a special holiday. On top of that, we missed planned trips due to this illness, resulting in even more money lost. Bed sheets were not cleaned once during our stay, despite us repeatedly requesting it. When we finally brought all these issues to the general manager and asked for compensation, he had the audacity to offer us ONE car for seven people to travel to the airport. Are you serious? This hotel is a disgrace—poor hygiene, terrible service, and food preparation that is outright dangerous. Stay away unless you want your health and your holiday ruined!"
"906.","Mitchell Norton","4","2025-01-20","1","Absolutely horrendous experience at this hotel. We arrived on time for check-in, only to be made to wait an outrageous 4 hours and 30 minutes before we could access our room. Completely unacceptable! The so-called “buffet breakfast” near the beachfront was a disaster—left out in the heat for hours without any covers, creating a breeding ground for bacteria. As a result, my entire family of seven came down with Bali belly, ruining three days of our holiday. To make matters worse, the housekeeping was atrocious. Despite specifically requesting clean sheets, they were only properly changed once during our five-day stay. This is the bare minimum one expects from a 4-star hotel, and they failed miserably. Avoid this hotel at all costs unless you want your vacation ruined by negligence and lack of basic hospitality. If I could give 0 stars I would."

The hotel falsely is advertised as a clean 4 star hotel but everything is dirty, the room had a mildew like stench to it, mould in the bathroom and all the walls were damaged or peeling. The lamps were mouldy with water stains. The staff isn't particularly friendly or service oriented, they are mainly concerned you give the hotel a bad review. We told them we weren't happy, very disappointed and asked for a different room. This was only possible when we accepted a same room (with a walk-in shower instead of showering in the bathtub)or pay extra. Because we were so unhappy we decided to go to another hotel. They didn't refund for the rest of the stay, so we took our loss and left. Be warned, the photos and reviews are not true in my opinion."

"914.","Tamas Kinsztler","36","2024-01-20","1","The hotel is over rated and priced compared to what it really is. You can find better hotels in this area. We payed extra for panorama ocean view, for this extra we could see the ugly roof of the hotel and the outdoor units of the air conditioner, this is really a scam. The air conditioner didn't work in our first room, after that we reported this to the reception, they sent someone to fix it while we were in town. When we arrived, the room was dirty and the air conditioner was still not working. We went down to the reception again, then they gave us another room sarcastically asking in the new room if it's going to be cold enough here? Yes, the air conditioner was working there, which should work without saying since it's 33 degrees outside. The hotel building is in a very bad condition and is not a 4-star hotel at all, the bathroom is also in an extremely bad condition, the water is dripping, the shower head is disgusting, the soap dispenser has fallen out of place. The beach next to the hotel is full of vendors who are very annoying and the beach is dirty. There is a constant traffic jam in the area, which makes it very difficult to reach the hotel by car and requires a lot of extra time. The breakfast is not tasty, there is not much choice, too many people, there is a hunger war in the restaurant. Cold meats are served outside a refrigerator without ice and there is no air condition in the room, this is not safe at all. We paid extra for late checkout upon our arrival, but after the lot of inconvenience, we canceled it next day at the reception, we have not received a refund since then. We have to start a claim through the bank."

Although we could not fault the staff, helpful and professional at all times, it was sad to see how it is expected of them to keep this sinking boat afloat while clearly this hotel is in desperate need of maintenance, cleaning, paint and an upgrade...not to mention the vomiting state the bathrooms are in. What was once our favorite hotel has turned into a sad, dirty building where not even the grass surrounding the swimming pool survived the neglect. What was meant to be a two week stay at Grand Inna Kuta, turned into a one night sickening experience from which we checked out as quickly as we could."

Went to our room and WiFi wasn’t working also the sink didn’t flush. So we went to the reception and they told us that the were going to solve it. Half hour later.. no one showed up. Back to reception to ask for an other room. Got to see another room that should be ready but was dirty with a lot of hair in the shower.🤢 complained to the manager and asked for a free upgrade because of the inconvenience, took us more than an hour and a half of our time, but nothing was possible. They moved us to same size room but a “clean one” what looked clean at first but when I opened the sheets is was completely dirty!! 🤢🤮 Complaint again, but didn’t got a response….

(Water drop) After we informed them, they sent maintenance team to us. They told us bc it's not cleaned yet but it's will be fine. The team will clean it tomorrow...? Question, they don't maintenance it properly??? That's how we are ending up woken up at 2am with A LOT of sweat. So in the morning we requested them AGAIN to change the room for 2nd night. We came back and found that the staff just cleaned the air con and confirmed us that it still works well. It's pretty upset me since the maintenance team confirmed that it works fine so our requested to change the room was ignored and we have to call maintenance team again on 2nd night because its still boiling hot in there... Normally i don't have high hope for great services but this decision is not good enough. It simply can be solved by changing room since they got all day to decide what to do. Dissapointed. More about the room: not clean, noisy"

For everything else, it is absolutely overpriced (room, beverages), the sea view I paid for is awful as everything I can see is an iron roof (with the sea far far behind it). Hotel is like a factory and infrastructures are clearly under-dimensioned. Pools may be great but there is a 60% chance you won't find a place to sit and therefore you have to go somewhere else. Same for the sea section. Worst hotel I ever had in Bali, so easy to find way better for a much better price as well."

The staff are very lovely. We stayed in the pool access rooms. One of the rooms which my brother & his wife had was appalling. The room was full of mould & every day they requested for it to be cleaned. My sisters-in-law ended up in hospital due to these conditions. Unfortunately with their travel insurance they had to pay the first $250 & that is what the hospital bill was. I approached the manager regarding this & asking as it was the fault of the rooms condition that they reimburse their $250 to which I was told no they don’t give refunds. I spoke to a couple of people around the pool to find out that there was a party of 10 in their group & they also had bad rooms. I was told on leaving that the rooms are to be upgraded in January. These rooms should NEVER have been used. Every time we stay here it has always been with a group, unfortunately we won’t be staying here again. Very disappointed Grand Inna, you should really look after your loyal customers as we have done when we come to Bali. I wouldn’t even give it a one star but it I didn’t it won’t let me post this."

Pelayanan di restoran sangat buruk, tidak friendly. Saya bisa memastikan bahwa saya tidak akan pernah mengunjungi hotel ini kembali. Definitely not reccomended! Very disappointing. Rooms cleaned however not perfectly. The breakfast menu is minimal and never replaced. In addition, the taste offered from the menu is also very bad. For three days, I was given the same menu until I got bored. The swimming pool is only open until 6 pm even though I previously stayed at several other hotels in Bali during the pandemic and the swimming pool can be used until late at night.

They did provide toiletries and a free mini bar of soda, but there were no washcloths to be found.

"935.","Milton Kilgour","105","2018-01-20","1","This must be one of the worst 4* Hotels I have stayed in my life! And I've traveled to over 30 Countries. Its reminds me of the tv program Hotels from Hell! The best thing was arriving with a warm greeting. From there it was all downhill! From the welcome drink voucher which wasn't, only green tea offered so I paid for an orange juice which was filled with pulp & pips that blocked the straw, to waiting for over 20 mins for 1 serving of fries which I ended up canceling. Then getting to our room which smelt damp to discover it was infested with mosquitoes, after killing 8 we called housekeeping for a can of spray, well that just upset the rest of them & we bailed out before being eaten alive plus getting no wifi reception. After expressing our disappointment to the service manager we were told there was only 1 other room available in the whole place. So we went for a look, with only finding 4 mozzies in this one & luckily it didn't smell as bad as the first, we agreed to change rooms for the night then proceeded to fumigate the room personally before bailing out for dinner down the road. As my photos show, it's more like a 2* hotel & how it got a 4* rating I will never know? There are mouldy and poorly fitted lights & switches, the walls & ceiling are patchy & mouldy & have spider webs, even the wall socket doesn't work! Today they are moving us to their new wing so we are hoping it is to a better standard. I was very close to changing hotels but the service manager assures me we will be much happier in their ocean front room in a new wing. So my advice is do not stay at the Grand Inna Kuta or you too will be very disappointed with your stay if not get malaria! I carefully researched this place but it goes to show that tourists can be easily mislead with online reviews! Their photos looked great! Now moved to better room but still stains on pillow cases and not to standard. Check out the seaview photos...lol, cleaning the roof might help the outlook."

"938.","Rebekah Hansen","28","2019-01-20","1","Rooms smelled like mould. Had to change rooms 2 times to get one that smelled 1/2 decent and buy an air freshener. Breakfast was good but with the price you're paying that's to be expected. Pools big but areas and furniture all run down. Sun deck rotted so bad there are massive whole in the decking, not very safe at all, especially for children. Hidden charges on check out approx. $85 AUD was an annoying end to a very average stay. Typical Bali money grabbing scamming. When I asked to speak to the GM they brought me the Office Manager (Rodiyana) as the GM was in meeting. When I asked Rodiyana about these hidden fees and charges he replied with they are not hidden we just don't tell our guest unless they ask. He also admitted that many times they have this dispute with guest upon check out but they will just pay it. You have too were his exact words, how disgusting! But he did agreed that their Don't ask, don't tell policy on this matter is ethically wrong then finished off with But have to pay, called for security and walked away. I asked to speak to the GM again and they brought me the Room Division Manager Yemi who once again wasted more of our time and spinning a different story of how we are the 1st guest to ever question these hidden charges and that I couldn't talk to the GM as he is at the airport picking up guests and could be 2-3 hours. Yeah ok, the hotel General Manager (Ben) is at Denpasar airport waiting with all the other drivers, holding a sign, picking up guest. While the hotel transfer drivers are sitting here doing nothing. If you are looking to stay here I suggest you take a look at Bali Garden Beach Resort, its around the same price but a million times better in all aspects. Plus far better quality and prices on food, drinks and spa treatments. For the money you pay to stay here there is definitely much better in Bali and Kuta. Update: In response to your reply we did call down to reception & enquire on making a call to Australia as there was something urgent we needed to attend to. Not once were told it was $4 a minute & your Office Manager said that was because we did not specify ask How much does it cost? I guess we we're given a false sense of security with being told, in that same enquiry call, that an international call is bit more but not much more, No one once told us not much more meant $4 AUD a min. And this didn't seem to be information the receptionists or Office manager knew when we went to check out either. It took both the receptionist and office manager a good 5 mins to find out that figure so I guess that was all just to hard for someone to do when we made our initial enquiry call down to the front desk. But when it comes down to it, it's not about the money it's about the principal. Your front desk gave very misleading information & acted very dumb when we got down there. Your Office manager admitted it's a don't ask don't tell policy and he too agreed it was ethically wrong. So maybe that's your hotel policy to try a weasel an extra buck from your guests or maybe your front desk staff are undertrained & the female we spoke to that morning was too lazy to find out. Either way, even without that last issue at the end. Your decks are still rotting with big gaping holes, the rooms smell like mould & have loads of baby cockroaches inhabiting them, probably because the daily room clean are very poor, we were given wrong billing at not only twice at the pool bar but also at the restaurant (lucky we checked) and quite frankly the hotel is run down and you know it. That's probably why you're resorting to scamming your guest. Like I said for the amount you're charging a night, there is far far better quality and value for money in Bali and Kuta. We decided by day 2 of our 6 night stay that we would not stay there again. And maybe instead of trying to defend and minimise all your short comings as a 4 star hotel you should take a little something on board.

Lensa kontak baru saya yang saya tinggalkan di kamar juga dibuang tanpa izin. Saya sudah membayar mahal untuk kamar suite, apa yang terjadi? Ini lebih buruk dari hotel bintang 1.

"987.","Naouel Latreche","10","2025-06-20","1","Kami menginap di Truntum Kuta dan pengalaman kami sangat mengecewakan. Hotelnya jelas ketinggalan zaman, fasilitasnya tua, dan harganya sangat buruk. Dengan harga yang ditawarkan, kami mengharapkan layanan yang standar, padahal tidak demikian halnya di sini. Sarapannya biasa saja, kualitasnya rata-rata. Dan yang lebih parah lagi: jika Anda ingin latte, ada biaya tambahan, meskipun seharusnya sudah termasuk sarapan. Latte seharusnya standar, bukan biaya tambahan! Kamar-kamarnya sangat mengecewakan: bau lembap yang sangat menyengat, sampai-sampai menyebabkan masalah pernapasan. Kebersihannya juga sangat buruk. Sebelum perjalanan kami berakhir, kami menghubungi pihak hotel (tanpa mendapat tanggapan) untuk menanyakan apakah mereka bisa menyimpan dua ransel selama beberapa jam, karena kami akan kembali ke Kuta sebelum penerbangan malam kami. Tidak ada balasan. Setibanya di sana, kami mencoba bertanya di resepsionis, tetapi ditolak mentah-mentah karena kami tidak lagi memiliki reservasi aktif, meskipun kami telah menginap di sana beberapa hari sebelumnya. Tidak ada usaha sama sekali, tidak ada rasa pelayanan pelanggan. Kami bahkan berencana untuk makan di restoran hotel, tetapi setelah itu, sia-sia. Untungnya, hotel lain yang lebih ramah bersedia menyimpan tas kami, meskipun kami belum pernah menginap di sana. Kesimpulannya: kami pasti tidak akan kembali ke Truntum Kuta pada perjalanan kami berikutnya ke Bali. Ada banyak pilihan yang lebih baik di Kuta, dengan keramahan yang tulus."

"989.","김엘사","2","2025-04-20","1","Ini akomodasi terburuk yang pernah saya tinggali di Bali selama dua minggu. Saya akan menghabiskan malam terakhir saya dengan perasaan tidak nyaman. Pertama, jadwal penerbangan saya terganggu, jadi saya membayar di muka untuk dua malam, tetapi akhirnya hanya menginap satu malam. Saya meminta pengembalian dana, tetapi mereka menolak, jadi saya diberi voucher makan malam. Namun, voucher itu kurang dari sepersepuluh harga satu malam, dan bahkan ketika saya memesan makanan termahal, mereka menolaknya. Makan malam ini bahkan tidak sebanding dengan cumi goreng yang saya pesan di bar kolam renang malam itu. Ada restoran bagus lainnya di hotel, jadi saya tidak mengerti mengapa saya harus membayar sebanyak ini. Akomodasinya sendiri bagus dari segi lokasi dan ukuran, tetapi pelayanannya sungguh buruk. Mereka menolak memberi saya pengembalian dana, dan kemudian memperlakukan saya seperti saya membayar makanan kaki lima. Kenangan indah terakhir saya di Bali hancur oleh hotel ini. Jangan pernah membayar di muka. Uangnya memang sedikit, jadi saya tidak masalah, tapi sungguh menyebalkan membayangkan mereka bisa mencari nafkah dengan menyediakan layanan seperti itu. Ini merusak kesan saya tentang keramahan penduduk Bali. Semakin saya memikirkannya, semakin menyebalkan rasanya. Ada restoran lain juga."
"990.","Carmen Alonso","2","2025-08-20","1","Mengerikan. Mereka baru memberi Anda kamar pukul 3 sore. Jika kamar Anda menghadap kolam renang, setiap hari pukul 3 sore mereka akan menyalakan musik keras-keras dan menggema di kamar. Anda tidak bisa beristirahat."

Sisanya harus dibayar ekstra. Bacon-nya seperti gumpalan daging yang dilempar dan direkatkan, dan jangan kaget, itu yang terbaik dari semua makanan. Resepsionis tidak peduli dengan Anda; Anda, sebagai tamu, bukan apa-apa! Manajer jaga berjanji akan menelepon setelah percakapan itu, dan mereka menunggu selama 4 hari untuk panggilan itu 😂 Teman-teman, HINDARI tempat sampah itu, jauhi tempat itu. Lebih baik saya tidak memberi tahu Anda apa pun tentang kondisi kolam renang, kamar, dan pantai 😂 Saya takut bertelanjang kaki di pantai atau di kolam renang. ANAK-ANAK TIDAK BOLEH DATANG. Saya sarankan agar manajemen hotel mempertimbangkan kembali seluruh situasi dan menawarkan standar yang Anda gambarkan.

Bellman yang membantu saya memindahkan barang bawaan membawakan kunci baru... tetapi kuncinya juga tidak berfungsi. Mereka bilang akan menggantinya dengan yang baru, tetapi saya menunggu 30 menit lagi... Saya bahkan tidak bisa menutup pintu... Nyamuk terus masuk ke kamar... Saya bahkan tidak bisa keluar atau tetap di dalam. Saya menelepon lagi 20-30 menit kemudian dan meminta mereka untuk mengganti kamar atau menyelesaikan masalah ini, tetapi mereka terus menunda permintaan saya. Akhirnya, saya menunggu selama satu jam tanpa sempat membongkar barang bawaan saya... Saya membuang-buang waktu perjalanan yang berharga. Saya menelepon lagi untuk mengeluh, tetapi mereka tidak menjawab. Saya bilang ingin pindah kamar atau melakukan sesuatu untuk menyelesaikan masalah ini, tetapi mereka malah menyuruh saya menunggu lagi. Saya mengeluh sudah menunggu satu jam, dan baru setelah itu mereka memberikan kartu kunci baru. Saya protes, meminta pengembalian uang. Kamarnya dalam kondisi buruk. Ini bukan hotel bintang 4. Kebersihannya lebih buruk daripada motel lokal. Kolam renangnya bagus dan lokasinya strategis. Stafnya juga ramah. Namun, layanan resepsionis dan kebersihan kamar perlu ditingkatkan.

Ini pertama kalinya saya mengalami pengalaman seburuk itu. Awalnya saya pikir rencana perjalanan dua orang, empat tangan itu unik, jadi saya sengaja memilih agen perjalanan yang menawarkannya. Saya akhirnya menggaruk tangan saya (kuku saya terlalu panjang). Mereka benar-benar tidak profesional. Mereka tidak menyentuh titik akupunktur apa pun, dan mereka mencubitnya dengan keras, yang terasa sakit. Dan mereka mengobrol dan tertawa sepanjang proses. Sungguh tidak sopan! Beberapa hari yang lalu, pemandu wisata kami membawa kami ke tempat pijat lain. Itu benar-benar pijat yang luar biasa! AC-nya juga ditempatkan dengan aneh. Atau mungkin tempat tidurnya perlu diposisikan ulang. Terlalu dingin untuk ditiupkan langsung ke kepala kami. Mereka bahkan tidak menyalakan air sebelumnya."

The room had mosquitoes on arrival, big gaps at the front door, stained sheets and curtains, cobwebs, sand, and overall wasn’t clean. Bathroom lighting was dull. Aircon, TV, and Wi-Fi were good. I wouldn’t pay more than 600K per night in the future, but I paid double that. Staff were friendly, but check-in is very late.

Kamar juga dibersihkan banyak kurang nya, showercap tidak di refill, handuk kecil tidak dikasih lagi, sprei tidak diganti. Cukup 1x aja saya kesini. 👎 Tapi untuk receptionis ramah"

"1053.","Krishan Champaneria","33","2025-01-20","2","You can tell this hotel used to be grand and nice back in the day, however now it's tired and needs more upkeep and maintenance (especially the bathrooms). The hotel is huge with 3 pools, but it also makes it feel very touristy, busy and chaotic (at breakfast it's hard to find a table). It's my least favourite of the 4 hotels I've stayed at around Bali, the other hotels were more unique, with a higher standard of service and nicer rooms. They also felt much more relaxing and peaceful places to stay. They give you a voucher for a welcome drink, but there is only 1 option - orange juice, no other alternatives are offered. The room was fairly big and spacious and would have been lovely when new. The bathroom on the other hand is small, with mould around the bath, toilet, sink. The mirror and taps are old and rusty. The shower pole fixture initially didn't work, but they fixed it for me. I found a bug in the bath mat (see photo). The worst was the mushroom I found growing out of the bath taps! (See photo) I've never seen mushrooms growing in bathrooms before! I also found a couple of ants in the little container with teas and sugar. The air conditioning unit needs a good clean, I got a sore throat from it, so tried to keep it off as much as possible. Towels are old and frayed, some with holes and stains. On my first night I went to their HQ restaurant and wanted to charge the meal to my room, which they said I have to speak to reception first and leave a deposit, no one told me this when I checked in. Thus the communication and information at check in could be better. Room service was a disaster. I ordered a Thai curry with rice and a drink. They forgot the rice and got my drink wrong. It took almost half an hour to get everything I ordered, by which time the food was cold. They then said I cannot charge it to the room, which was specifically why I left a deposit at reception the day before. I had to call reception who then sorted it. The hotel has direct access to the beach, but it's not nice like it looks in the photos. The beach is full of wooden logs and rubbish (see photo) and there were signs saying no swimming. They gave me a quiet room, but the walls and door are not soundproof at all. All night you can hear people banging doors, singing, whistling, using the safe, flushing the toilet etc."

"1055.","sanjana yadav","9","2025-01-20","2","Checked in today. Feel disappointed and let down with the hotel hospitality. We booked the executive suite (which we got 1.5 hrs late after much back and forth) and got dinner buffet vouchers for NYE. At the time of booking the hotel didn't inform us about these vouchers nor was there any intimation at any time that these will be given.. So we went ahead and made Nye dinner reservations at another place and paid for that. My husband requested for the voucher to be adjusted on any other day for dinner so we can use it. The hotel manager /staff flatly refused. This is not how Truntrum Kuta will get repeat customers!! This was our 2nd time at bali and 1st visit at this hotel.."

"1057.","Scott Kecil","16","2024-01-20","2","We just needed a place to stay in Kuta as a little bit of a stopover between destinations and to get some clothes tailored. Location is pretty central in Kuta and right near the beach. Given the price of this place we were a little disappointed. Staff are friendly enough and say hello, however rooms and facilities are looking a little tired. The breakfast is a little like the place, bland, busy and generally unfulfilling. What was most disappointing was we asked lady at reception to book us a taxi to the airport, to which she replied yes and wrote down - however when we arrived at the time were advised “no taxis”, we have drivers to take you for 200k. Wasn’t worth fighting at that stage, just will never be back"
"1058.","Jaylen H","2","2025-01-20","2","Location amazing for obvious reasons. Room is just your average room in bali. Nothing bad to say about it. Soo good 👍 Unfortunately the service we had the first day we got here. We left 300,000 IDR ($30aud) in the room and went to breakfast, while we were eating breakfast the room got cleaned. When we got back, the money was no were to be seen. And since we had only just got there from the airport and had not spent any money. It was quite sad to realise what had happened to it. Most staff are friendly its just sad that one bad staff member puts the look on all of them. We also did not get compensated at all 😕"
"1059.","Bjarne Andreasson","76","2022-01-20","2","I’m absolutely not happy with my stay. After one day we change to another hotel. I know the corona situation effect everyone but a 4 star hotel ( ???) should be better. The breakfast was flat. Big holes in the floor where we eat. People smoking in the cafeteria. The trolley the staff use to move the used cutlery and plates was very dirty. It is forbidden according to the Indonesian law to smoke public but the hotel provide ash bear in the cafeteria with no separate area. Only positive was that the beach was close"

It felt like a leftover room. please dont say you give all upgraded for the booking without similar room for all the groups. Near lobby is not benefit when the room not having hallway and soundproofed door, it's noisy. I'm sorry but pretty much dissapointed for this range of hotel you can offer better."
"1062.","Maxim Karpyn","14","2024-01-20","2","It sure does have a good location next to the beach, and the staff is nice enough, but that's where it ends. My partner and I went to pool area to hang out and quickly left horrified. There was mould and water damage everywhere. The pool had missing tiles. The sun beds were faded and we even found one with mould. The bathroom had a leaky tap and a was very water damaged. At the very least stay away from the pool area, but the whole place looked runned down."
"1063.","Michelle","29","2023-01-20","2","Great location and friendly staff. Found the buffet breakfast food to be cold on several occasions. Lunch ordered once in the HQ dining area where I saw a rat and they forgot my partners meal (only 2 of us and not busy). Room service food twice tasted like it had been left in and warmer for too long and was dried out. The WIFI continually dropped out. I had to report this multiple times a day! I could tell they were getting sick of me. Don’t stay here if you need to use WIFI. Our room had a broken rain shower that was never fixed and sink plug that maintenance had to lift up to drain the water every day. The air conditioner was quite dirty and didn’t provide enough cool air once the afternoon sun hit so we had to keep the blinds closed and block out our ocean view. Rooms really need maintenance. Would not expect this from a fairly expensive hotel. Probably won’t be back to this location, plenty of other places in Kuta beach area."
"1064.","Riki","24","2024-01-20","2","It is in the heart of kuta however there are huts on the beach blocking the ‘beachfront view’. It also rained when we stayed there and the water came through the sliding door. The water from the bath smelt like sewerage. The shower water overflowed into the main bathroom everyday. The balcony is made of timber and says ‘do not lean’ - that was a safety concern. The air con was locked and we couldn’t make it cooler in the room. Executive suite is on the other side of the hotel and a lengthy walk to the entrance."
"1065.","David Horvath","2","2019-01-20","2","There is nothing Grand about this hotel any more. I was let down on my last visit and it did not meet my expectations. HQ Bar has a poor menu, and when I asked for a milkshake for my partner, I was told it was not on their beverage list and to go to the other pool and order it there. When I was presented a food menu, twice we where told they had run out of the requested item. The Bathroom flooded every night, we reported it and where told that it is an old hotel. No one was concerned. But I guess that's the relaxed Bali attitude. Attention to detail is a must for all Hotels which this establishment seems to have forgotten. It's tired and old."

Also was uncompensated for miscommunication on their end when trying to book a shuttle from airport, them saying the email went into spam and it wasn't their fault nobody replied to us.

"1145.","Siahn","5","2025-12-20","3","We recently stayed at truntum for 2 weeks as a family of 4 in a grand deluxe pool side room. We have always stayed here when it was grand inna as the location is amazing for us. The staff are all amazing and our toddlers loved spending time with all the girls at reception and at breakfast. My eldest loved joining in on the hotel activities. Thank you to Indayani & Nina for being so lovely to our family. We chose a pool side room so we could swim while the kids had a midday nap. One day our room hadn’t been cleaned before their sleep yet and we always put the do not disturb sign up and have the door locked. My husband rushed back in the room (because he heard something on the monitor) to find two men in the room who had woken up our girls and scared them. He told them to get out multiple times and when I went to complain about this I was told that it’s hotel policy to check the rooms at 2pm (they had used the master key) and that I need to call management to let them know that my children were sleeping. Absolutely unacceptable. It made me feel unsafe in my own room. If we hadn’t of experienced this I would’ve given an absolutely glowing review but this policy needs to be reviewed. It’s a violation of privacy. Out of our two week stay we only had one negative but it was a pretty big one. We will most likely stay here again in the future but I will definitely be bringing this up and discussing it before checking in."
"1146.","Scott M","5","2025-09-20","3","Stayed in a Grand Deluxe room for 7 nights. Was initially on the ground floor. Room safe didn't work and was eventually replaced, but was not secured properly. Room seemed a bit damp, and after hearing water dripping in the bathroom discovered that water was leaking through the ceiling above the shower. Ceiling was bulging and appeared to be an old problem by the amount of mould in the shower area. Disappointing first day, and we were then moved to a room on the upper floor with a pool view. This was much better. This section of the hotel is quite old, and rooms are starting to show their age. Comfortable enough though. Location is probably the best part of this hotel if you want to be in the heart of Kuta, and right on the beach. Swimming pools (3) were all good. Breakfast was a big disappointment. We have stayed at numerous hotels in Bali, and this was by far the most disappointing. Coffee was like black sludge, so we reverted to tea which was often empty and not refilled. Not enough food options. Egg stations were a saviour, and fruit was okay. We would be hesitant to stay here again, but may be tempted mainly because of the location."
"1147.","Dakota","3","2025-08-20","3","A Decent Stay, But Definitely Needs Renovation We stayed at Truntum Kuta for 2 weeks from 19th July to 2nd August 2025. While our stay was mostly okay, there were some key areas where improvement is really needed especially if the hotel wants to meet modern expectations. What We Liked: • The staff were absolutely lovely — warm, friendly, and helpful throughout our stay. • The entertainment around the pool and bar was enjoyable and gave the hotel a great atmosphere. • Linen and towels were replaced daily, which was great to see. • The in-house laundry service was quick, affordable, and very convenient. • The beachside pool has a beautiful view and relaxing vibe (though in need of repairs — see below). • A friend of ours used the babysitting service, which they found reliable, affordable, and flexible, with carers available to watch children up until 10 PM — a huge plus for families. What Needs Work: • The rooms had a damp, musty smell, which is somewhat expected in a tropical climate but still unpleasant. • In Room 2109, the air conditioning unit frequently froze, stopped working, and began leaking water onto the floor. Both myself and my 15-month-old child slipped as a result — definitely a safety concern. • The hotel did send a repair technician, but the problem continued. The system was clearly mismatched and struggling — the indoor unit was an old LG, while the outdoor compressor was AUX branded, possibly contributing to the issue. • The mattress was extremely hard. We requested a topper, but unfortunately it made little difference in comfort. • Room cleanliness was below expectations, not due to poor housekeeping, but more so because the furnishings were worn and outdated. • The rain-style showerhead appeared loose and looked like it might fall from the ceiling. • The beachside pool had numerous missing tiles, and some even came loose underfoot while we were swimming — it’s definitely due for renovation. • We paid extra to include breakfast, but only used it a few times. The quality and variety were underwhelming, and it didn’t feel worth the cost. Final Thoughts: This hotel has a great location, lovely staff, and some excellent services for families, like babysitting and laundry — but it’s being let down by ageing infrastructure and inconsistent maintenance. We would consider staying again, but only after the renovations are completed, as there are too many issues at the moment for it to be truly comfortable or good value for money. If you’re planning to book soon, it’s worth checking what stage the renovations are at and which wing of the hotel your room will be in."

Pillows are horrible. Bed comfy. Breakfast good. Service great. Spa service good. Air con in room very noisey. Sunlounges get grabbed early and the one hour policy is not enforced leaving a lot of patrons unable to relax by the pool. The first day we couldn’t even get a pool towel for two hours"
"1149.","Sharon Rankin","3","2025-06-20","3","Found the hotel to be very tired. The reception staff on arrival asked if we wanted to upgrade our room as our room was right in the back of the hotel so we agreed but then had to wait for what seemed like ages in the heat while they did the paperwork and then we had to pay upfront. We were not offered a cool drink or cold towel even tho we were struggling in the heat while they did the paperwork. The bathroom in our room was terrible. It was small and the shower was not good. There was no door and when you showered water went everywhere- even into the room. Really quite dangerous as a slip hazard. The towels are so thin and old. The bathmat had to be wrung out after each shower - it was useless. Half the time the hand towels were not replaced. I had to ask for them. There is no storage for clothes. No drawers just a couple of open shelves. The fridge didn’t work. When reported they said they fixed it or replaced it but it still wasn’t cold. When you get a drink at the pool bar and put it on your room you have to pay before you go back to your room. If you don’t they ring you and chase you for the money. I wanted to pay at the end or every couple of days but they say you can’t and it has to be settled each day. I’m sorry but I don’t want to have to take money or a card to the pool. On the day we left we had to check out and we had 4 hours till we could leave for the airport. They wanted $90 for a room for the 4 hours. When I said this was expensive they dropped it to $70 for the 4 hours. Other hotels we have stayed in have a transit lounge so I would look into that next time. I wouldn’t stay there again"

We had a ocean view room and while lovely to watch the sunset with the floor to roof windows, once the afternoon sun hit it was unbearably hot and the little air con was powerless against it. Smart TVs would be a huge improvement as there is nothing to watch on the 3 english channels. The staff are sensational!!!"
"1164.","nibbles","3","2024-01-20","3","We have just returned after 7 nights at this hotel. The rooms are modern, gardens well tended and position is fabulous. Breakfast was very busy and seating was sometimes difficult to find. The pools were very disappointing. Each morning towels were placed on pool chairs by guests. Making it very difficult for guest to get a chair in a shady spot or even get a chair at all. The pool staff did nothing to police this. At one point a guest was verbally abused by another guest as she had sat on a pool chair that this awful woman thought was hers, because it had a towel and magazine on it. This very loud woman was never spoken to by any of the staff and every day after that, her 2 towels were placed on the same 2 pool chairs every morning and left there all day. During this altercation the staff watched on and did absolutely nothing. Another problem was unsupervised children in the pool. Parents sometimes nowhere in site. Slapping pool noodles on the pool water repeatedly, screaming and yelling and parents just ignoring their behaviour. Another problem was mothers feeding their children while in the pool. Sometimes leaving rice and vegetables floating in the water. Whatever happened to children getting out of the water to eat? I did email the GM at the hotel, but I did not receive a response. If you are looking for a stress free hotel, where you can lie by the pool on a pool chair and be able to have some peace, do not stay at this hotel!"

Krn ada tiang penghalang sy turun untuk pindahkan tiang itu. Bapak pegawai hotel malah melihat saja,bukan menolong.dimana sebagai karyawan hotel tdk ada turun tangan untuk membantu tamu.(malah liatin.)Sedangkan itu tugas nya sebagai karyawan hotel.Sy sdh parkir tanpa ada bantuan.Seturun saya dr mobil bapak Karyawan hotel malah liatin dn bertanya bisa di bantu.. dimana ada pegawai hotel seperti itu kecuali di Grand Inna Hotel. Saya merasa sangat kecewa. Tidak ada ramah nya. semua pegawai kl tdk ada tamu siapa yg gaji. Tanpa tamu, pegawai tdk ada krj .maka itu pendapat sy pegawai di Grand inna kuta, tdk ramah.. ( dr fronthotel, belboy, security) Saya tidak akan lagi kembali. Reputasi sangat jelek sekali. Kamar pun sangat lembab, bnyk jamur di tembok kamar (tidak sehat ntuk paru paru) Sekali lg saya mohon Maaf mengeluh, tp memang kenyataan seperti itu di hotel Grand Inna Kuta. Saya memilih Grand Inna Kuta karena sangat strategis TOP posisi letak hotel. Setelah sy menjelaskan mengeluh situati karyawan hotel kepada Manager Grand Inna Kuta, bapak manager sangat membantu dan memberi kami kesempatan yg sangat baik. benar ramah dn membantu. Sy boleh pilih kamar dimana saya merasa nyaman. Dan juga mobil boleh parkir di tempat parkiran nya Boss.

The room does not have an electrical outlet next to the bed, a significant disadvantage 2. A lot of walking from the entrance to the hotel to the rooms 3. The hotel is outdated and not well maintained, for example the glass in my room was broken, as well as the structure Looks very old and uninviting from the outside. To praise Juni's excellent service! A good guy who only wants to help, also to note that the hotel let me enter two hours before the time and an hour later to check out"

If you have any group that book in your hotel, please make their schedule of breakfast and inform them not to make some noise, its very anoying in the morning with their activity.

However the Aircon in our room did not work properly. It was very hot when we arrived so we called them to check and they send staffs to clean the aircon which takes around 30 minutes and we saw how dirty it was. Hoping it will get better after that but still aircon is not cold enough. The hotel also did not offer us to change room (maybe they are all fully booked? we don't know). It is an old hotel so the hotel area looks as what we expect, room still okay looks like they renovated it. Room is clean (we got a room near front office seems better than the ones on the other side) but the lights in the room i thinks are not enough also the biggest problem is the aircon made our stay uncomfortable and want to move hotel."

Mulai dari jaga jarak di lobby, hingga penyediaan cek suhu dan hand santizer. Hotel jg memberikan 1 pcs masker scuba di kamar hotel. Kekecewaan muncul pada restaurantnya. Sajian breakfast disana benar benar hambar. Tidak ada rasanya. Ditambah lagi pegawai hotel kurang sigap membersihkan meja yang selesai di pakai tamu sebelumnya. Part yg membuat saya sangat tersinggung adalah saat saya check out dari hotel ingin menunggu santai di restaurantnya. Penerbangan jam 16.00. Saya memutuskan untuk santai sejenak sambil minum jus dan kopi di restoran HQ. Setelah order Pegawai dengan ketawa kecil berucap ini aja pak gak makan ingin saya rasanya melempar bantal biru yg ada di sofa. Cobalah diganti kalimatnya. Seperti menjelaskan ada menu favorit untuk makan siang. Mungkin pada mau coba. Tanpa lama2 disana saya minta bon menghampirinya yg sedang sibuk main handphone. Lebih baik cabut dari hotel dan menunggu di bandara. Ingat yah. Kami turis lokal. Saat pandemi kaya gini. Kami yang di harapkan, untuk menambah pendapatan/devisa pariwisata."

While others hotels may claim in front of Kuta beach but mostlt will separate with asphalt road to cross before to thr beach. We order 2 room with connecting. access and the room is spacious. Even the appearance looks old dated but it has been renovated with modern furniture. What we like in the room they provie the real mini Sanyo refrigerator with ice cube maker. It mean we could create own ice cube then added in our drink. The real refrigerator also cooler our water bottle faster very nice. Hotel have 2 big pools. One main pool with fresh water and shade of building/tree give good place to soak. Another outdoor pool in front access of the beach so aftet from the beach then could plunge on the pool. The breakfast in the morning is not much in menus.Taste it good. But being big hotel with many guests especially in the recover time after pandemic time seem it lack of staff in the restaurant. No one atte d the dirty desk ex previous guest. We must move it ownself before we can use it. It is unfortunately durimg the peak time of some event. So many person keep smoking and polluted the fresh breeze of open air restaurant. We suggest manamegent could a separate area for event like this and do not mix with hotel guest. In the end the clean glass or cup is empty at all nd not provided so we use soup cup to make our coffee.. So this actualky nice budget hotel"

Location was great being close to the beach, shopping and many restaurants and warungs. The staff were attentive and friendly.

The orders have been wrong both times and the food is average, but not terrible. The location of the hotel is amazing right near waterbo, Hardrock and lots of shops.

"1184.","David Kingsley","52","2022-01-20","3","The wife and I only stayed here for about 3 nights. Upon arrival, there was a rather large group checking in, but either they were set aside for us or they were checked in very quickly. Took about 15 minutes of waiting before we were tended to. Quite fast in my opinion. The bathroom that was available at check in didn't smell very pleasant. Like people didnt know how to aim whilst urinating. We were upgraded from garden view to pool view which was quite unexpected. The room was quite nice. There was some complimentary items. They gave more essentials even if we didn't ask for it when they cleaned the room. This is a plus in my opinion. I love not having to asl for more shampoo and the like. We were also provided with a nice little honeymoon note as well as a reasonably sizeable box of chocolate cookies that tasted quite nice. My complaint about this place is how many commoners there are here, and the lack of enforcement of mask and glove policy on the premesis. The commoners hardly wear masks, and when going to the breakfast buffet, they don't use the protective glove to retrieve their food. Considering we don't know who uses the rest room and doesn't wash their hands afterwards, this is kind of a disgusting though. The buffet attendants should be reprimanding the commoners and forcing them to wear the gloves. There's no shortage of rude smokers. Most of them sit upwind of everyone and then smokes like a choo choo train. Not pleasant. They should have a designated smoking area for these people that is located in a manner as to be downwind from other patrons at all times. The internet sucks. It's difficult to get a signal. Just like the FM7 in Jakarta, I am giving an automatic 3 stars for that. When you're a traveler, you expect reasonable access to Internet so you can conduct business or talk with family and friends in the homeland, and stay entertained as well. DO NOT... I REPEAT N. O. T. get your clothing washed here inless it is an absolute emergency. It's rediculously expensive. We needed to get our clothings washed, and decided upon a laundry washer somewhere around the corner. In total, I give 3 stars for bad internet, and refusal of the catering staff to enforce the mask and glove rule at the breakfast buffet. Overall, the staff that we encountered were quite nice. No complaints there. Suggestions to Grand Inna Kuta: 1) Install more wifi access points to allow a better connection to all the rooms. This isn't a tall task. They're easy to install. 2) Enforce the glove and mask rule. If a customer comes to the buffet, prevent them from touching the serving utensils until they glove up. Alternativelty, have the catering staff serve the food instead. This works just as well. 3) Designated smoking areas. Nobody likes a rude smoker... And there's more of them in Indonesia than respectful smokers."

But I can say they have only 2 nice things and they are location and hotel's scenery by garden and pool. My seaview room is outdated. All furniture seems they have been use since early 2000s. Everything simple like Ibis. From what I paid, I feel appointment and regret on my bad choice. 😅( was not so pricey so far, but I don't think this hotel worth that cost of room) Service.... My first experience with balineses who not already my friends started here. Security guys are nice, Bells are nice (not sure that truly nice but he saw me give big tip to my driver I guess) Receptions both check in and check out take act like I come to beg free room something.? Heard some rumor before travel here that Asean Travellers will be set as second class. It seems true now 😅 Do not trust my review tho. I spend only 14-15 hours there . I paid only small money ~ 100$ for a night stop before moving to Lambogan. No big expectations here. But still regret why I didn't pay a little more and go to Hard Rock or Sheraton?"

Prepare to gasp for oxygen whilst drinking at the pool bar, relaxing by the pool and eating breakfast. Other than that, the breakfast is quite good, with a variety of meals to choose from. We stayed in an Interconnecting Family Room, the rooms were nice with comfortable bedding and pillows and standard bathroom. The multiple pools offered plenty of room to swim with the added bonus of kiddie pools at each! The TV system is appalling and the wifi generally overcrowded. I would suggest bringing a laptop with DVD player and HDMI output to access your own media etc"
"1189.","Stephanie W","14","2019-01-20","3","Great location at Kuta, easy to walk around and shopping & dinning out! The staff at front desk were very friendly and helpful. But there is no fence between the swimming pool and the public beach. not recommended to have dinner at hotel."
"1190.","Taariq Hassim","61","2019-01-20","3","The good: The hotel facilities are amazing. 3 pools, 1 on the beach front. Free towel usage. Free photography coupon on arrival. Free WiFi. There are a lot of amenities. Great buffet breakfast. It's close to a lot of great shops and restaurants. Definitely top points on location.The Superior room beds are quite nice. And bonus points for having an ice tray and compartment in the fridge. The not so good: Service is better than what we have in our home country but they aren't as warm as what we experienced in Sanur. The free WiFi is slow at best. Taxis are available just outside the hotel, however they cost a premium. Recommend walking just outside the hotel for a 30-40% price drop. Finally, you don't want to spend too much time in the room. Temperamental aircon, tiny TVs with not great reception, a bit of a dark ambiance, comparatively small bathrooms and plug points in not so ideal spots. Recommend they start revamping and modernizing. The rooms are outdated and not user friendly. Oh, additional sound proofing would be nice. Loud neighbors can be annoying too."

"1193.","Joel Cain","2","2020-01-20","3","First room we stayed in was horrific, smelt like mould and the shower didn’t drain very well. We asked to be upgraded to the deluxe room (payed a little extra but it was worth the money). I would 100% say not to stay in the old looking rooms ( the cheaper) I would 100% recommend the deluxe rooms."
"1194.","Sarah Putri","44","2022-01-20","3","The room was good, i got the executive class. For the deluxe, just like another 3star hotel. The buffet restaurant, the omelet was fine, the fruits were fresh, but the indonesian foods were bland."

Tapi pas pertama kali masuk room nya bau apek, di bathoom ga ada sabun & shampoo. Gedungnya terpisah susah ke gedung satu nya mesti jalan kaki. Lift cuma ada 1 digedung utama. Bangunannya keliatan tua. Tapi ada hairdryer. Resto nya kurang cahaya"
"1196.","Dias Oldy Wiratama","23","2020-01-20","3","This hotel turns out into an average one because there are no access to the old building.. so you guys have to walk and its a long way. Especially when you have to bring your babies and goods. Quite exhausting. Food is also normal, no special... the extra credit just go for the location, which is the bearest to Kuta Beach and Beachwalk Bali."
"1197.","Mr Ian","487","2023-01-20","3","Fantastic location, friendly helpful staff. Stayed in the old building which is really showing its age and definitely needs a revamp. The new building looks much more modern. WIFI was very average in room as well 😫. But would stay here again."
"1198.","Stephen Milam","1","2020-01-20","3","The old section of the hotel needs renovations. There were no lamps in the room for reading at night. Everything looked old and needed replacement.

"1200.","Yuanita Yuanita","608","2020-01-20","3","i booked 2 superior rooms and i didnt know that superior rooms located in old building, the new building is for deluxe an suite rooms. the superior room i booked was 3104 and 3114. 3104 located at the corner, old room and the bed is not comfortable, the aircon also very dirty, room not really clean, all inside the room are old furniture that need to be replaced. the bathroom has bath tub but the bathroom drainage didn’t work well, the bath tub surface a bit slippery. 3114 seems like has renovated a bit, the bathroom looks new, no bath tub but clean and new shower, rooms furniture also old but looks nicer than 3104."
"1201.","Wade Jordan","115","2023-01-20","3","This hotel needs a refresh. While there is ongoing maintenance it is not sufficient to keep pace with the scale of the work needed in a hotel of this size. Much of the hotel appears abandoned which is not what I expected. Various decks and levels have fallen into disuse and neglect. While the current team in service is working hard to keep this grand old dame running... they are insufficient to the task. Posting a pic of one of the disused/abandoned areas. While I agree that it may be surplus to need. Allowing it to fall into disrepair doesn't speak well of the general maintenance"

"1204.","網男（醫美孖八）","8","2018-01-20","3","Bad points: (1) beach front pool suddenly undergo renovation till end of May 2017 while the management just give 5 day prior notice. (2) breakfast restaurant just overlooking the renovation site with noise & dust starting at 9am rather than hearing the sound from sea waves (3) Old wing (Bali wing) is at most a three star hotel, no better than Yilia Beach Inn which is 100M nearby and cost just half the price. (4) The Sunken pool at old wing is very hot and lack shades (5) Superior pool view room just got a small concrete balcony & it's not pleasant to sit outside (6) The room got not enough illumination especial in the bathroom over the mirror side (7) The connecting room at the end of the corridor has two interconnecting doors on both side of the room which are thin and you can hear the neighboring guest's coughing and talking. (8) Shower area has no glass door and the shower curtain is too short to prevent flooding the floor of the bathroom (9) the main door in the connecting room has no security hole (10) the wifi connection is not strong and steady with intermittent drop out (11) the corridor in Bali wing is like a sauna area as all the split type air conditioner unit are facing the patio, you will get more sweaty while walking to and from your room"
"1205.","SR Hamilton","5","2023-01-20","3","Lovely hotel though the beach pool tiles need replacing and they didn’t have all the food on the menu which is a shame cos they had a monthly special which is Indo food but it wasn’t available Defiantly a nice hotel though and the choice of 3 pools is a plus"
