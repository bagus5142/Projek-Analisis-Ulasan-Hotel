"1.","Jay Jung","13","2025-12-25","5","Absolutely one of the best resorts I’ve ever stayed at. Beautiful architecture, calm and relaxed atmosphere, and not crowded at all, which made the stay truly peaceful. The pool is excellent and very clean, and the whole resort is well maintained. The staff were always smiling and genuinely kind, which made a big difference. Christmas dinner made the experience even more special. Would definitely come back. Highly recommended for a quiet and refined getaway."
"2.","Bhagwan Kalamkar","32","2025-12-17","5","Resort is very nicely landscaped and spacious. Staff is always approachable and eager to help. Very clean passageways. Good spread of breakfast items. We had interesting conversation with Indra who was working at the pool, when he was placing pool towel rolls he was adding one flower in it & stacking it nicely. He also asked us on how was our experience in Bali. These people always add value to their work."
"3.","Kate M","21","2025-10-31","5","We had the most incredible stay at The Meru. The architecture is magnificent, the rooms (or suites I should say) beautifully appointed & incredibly spacious. There is only one restaurant (& the pool bar) on site but the menu was incredible. We actually reordered the same thing a couple of times because they were so good (the mango salad & the tuna were favourites). There are so many other restaurants & bars in walking distance you are spoilt for choice. The service was a little slow, sometimes we had to ask for water, remind them of high chair, and at one stage they completely forgot a side. But honestly, you’re in such an incredible setting, with such beautiful food & the friendliest staff, we couldn’t even be upset. Bali service all around is a little slower than we’re accustomed to but by far the friendliest & kindest we have ever received. All of the staff are a credit to the establishment & really made our stay. The location is perfect. Quiet but so close to an abundance of bars, shops, restaurants & icon mall. We stayed 20-25th Oct & didn’t have any issues with overcrowding. Always an abundance of pool beds & tables at the restaurant available. We were blown away by The Meru, we’re already raving to friends & family."
"4.","A DA","46","2025-12-10","5","had a wonderful experience at this amazing hotel. I stayed for three days, from November 29th to December 2nd, in a corner room. The hotel was very clean and tidy, and the service was available 24/7. I was warmly welcomed and celebrated on my honeymoon. The hotel is located right on the beach, and the breakfast was varied. Everyone at the hotel was welcoming, helpful, and went above and beyond. I will definitely visit again; it's truly worth it. Special thanks to Dhea for his efforts."
"5.","Adi","6","2025-12-17","2","I have been here for several time to have lunch or dinner but never enjoyed the service from the Waiter or Waitress. Last week we had dinner with 6 of us and ordered Champagne and wine. Server never come back and asking how was the Champagne and the wine, never pour our Champagne and wine and i have to pour by myself to our guests. We ordered bottles of water but Server just place the bottles on the table and they never open it of course never pour to our glass. We paid gratuity for IDR 808,500 but we got very poor service from them. We always enjoyed the view and the ambiences also the food was great but never enjoyed their services."

"7.","Sky-Lee Martin","25","2025-10-31","5","We booked our 5 night stay at The Meru via Luxury Escapes. I was a little unsure as I had seen mixed reviews about the hotel, some good, some average. All the doubts I had were very quickly washed away. The hotel is absolutely top quality. The suites are stunning. The food was very good, unfortunately we don't eat fish or seafood so this reduced our menu options to possibly half. We had vouchers included in our stay package and I was expecting a very small menu to choose from, but we practically had the full menu to choose from, so this was excellent value. The pool bar menu was excellent, the drinks were excellent. I quite loved the Pink Limo, do try it. Shout out to the amazing staff through the whole venue. They made you feel welcome and appreciated every day. Special shout out to the pool bar staff who were so friendly: Hendra, Radya, Ricky & Try. The check in process was smooth, the reception area is so beautiful. Everywhere you look it is just breathtaking. The pool 2 areas were huge, there were no loud offensive kids making noise as other posts suggest, just relocate if you don't want to be around it. The pools are HUGE, and there was not a need to rush out and find chairs, there were always heaps of spaces available."
"8.","K trima","2","2025-10-01","2","First impressions are important at a hotel, and unfortunately ours started poorly with the welcome drinks. Out of the three cups we received, two had problems: one was cracked and leaking, and another had a large chip right where you put your mouth. It was a relief that my child didn’t use it, but it was disappointing to see such a basic detail overlooked. The staff apologized and offered lounge access, but it didn’t really make up for it. The room itself was spacious with a nice balcony, but I expected the bathroom to be spotless, especially in a new hotel. Instead, the floor had heavy dark stains—possibly due to structural design issues—and they looked like mold. It made showering uncomfortable. We considered asking for a room change, but since we were only staying for two nights, we didn’t bother. In hindsight, we probably should have. For reference, we booked the cheapest room, so maybe the higher-category rooms are different. Breakfast was advertised until 10:30, but by 10:00 the staff had already started clearing food and dishes, which made it difficult to enjoy a relaxed meal. Overall, the service and cleanliness did not feel like a true 5-star experience, and the value for money was low. With so many new hotels opening in Bali, we won’t be choosing this one again."
"9.","Yag Yang","22","2025-12-01","5","Our stay at this hotel was truly exceptional. ✨ Every staff member we encountered was warm, attentive, and genuinely passionate about their work. Their kindness and professionalism made our stay unforgettable. A special appreciation to Krisna, who anticipated our needs with great care and even helped us capture beautiful photos during our stay. By the way, Krisna is a truly talented photographer — he captured such wonderful moments for us that we’ll always treasure. ☺️ Highly recommended for anyone visiting Bali — you’ll absolutely love your stay here! 🌿"
"10.","Sonny Tanoto","41","2025-10-31","5","I had an amazing stay at The Meru Sanur. From the moment I arrived, the staff made me feel genuinely welcome because every single one of them was polite, helpful, and incredibly attentive. The service is truly beyond 5-star, and it’s clear that everyone here takes great pride in their work. The room was spacious, elegant, and very comfortable. Everything was spotless and well-maintained. The only small improvement I’d suggest is to enhance the soundproofing, but that didn’t affect my overall experience. The beach area is beautifully maintained — clean, quiet, and peaceful that offering a perfect spot for relaxation. Overall, The Meru Sanur exceeded my expectations in every way. I’d absolutely stay here again and recommend it to anyone visiting Sanur."
"11.","Xyle L","117","2025-10-31","5","Very exquisite well maintained hotel with large suite rooms that’s like a villa. You will be welcomed with a museum-like hallway going to the reception. Makes you feel like you’re really having a vacation on a different country. Beautiful and quiet. Room is so spacious, has native style with warm toilet seat built with bidet. It’s also close to the boardwalk where you could see a lot of things to do. They offer lots of amenities that highlights complimentary photo session with 1 digital copy, one hour bike rental, huge breakfast buffet selection with fresh south east asian tropical fruits, fully equipped fitness center, pool facing the beach with beach access. Very family friendly. Staff are accommodating and make sure your stay is comfortable. Thanks to the kitchen team and chef for bringing us mangosteen and mangoes. One of my best stays in Bali."
"12.","Diandini Putri","16","2025-12-01","5","We had such a great experience at The Meru Sanur. The room was absolutely luxurious, beautifully designed, very clean, and comfortable. Everything felt fresh and well-maintained, which made my stay even more relaxing. The pool area was stunning and the service was excellent. Special thanks to Yuda, the pool attendant, for being so attentive and friendly. He made sure guests had everything they needed and always greeted everyone with a smile. Overall, The Meru Sanur exceeded my expectations in every way. I’ll definitely be coming back!"
"13.","Brittany Mark","11","2025-10-31","5","An absolute 5 star experience from beginning to end. The grounds are immaculate, the rooms are beautiful however the key highlight is all of the incredible staff on site. Every single person was friendly, with a big smile. Resort is quiet, yet a short walk along the boardwalk to many restaurants and bars. Breakfast onsite was incredible with whatever your heart desires. We will absolutely not hesitate to stay again - and would highly recommend to anyone wanting a relaxed, resort stay."
"14.","Claire Chong","255","2025-12-01","5","I stayed at Meru Sanur while attending a conference, and I have nothing but praise for this wonderful hotel. From the moment I arrived, the team went above and beyond in every possible way. The staff here are truly remarkable, they were warm, kind, and always ready with a genuine smile. Every interaction felt sincere and full of care. The service throughout my stay was impeccable. Whether it was at the front desk, housekeeping, or the restaurant team, everyone exuded professionalism and genuine hospitality. The attention to detail was evident in everything they did, making me feel valued and well taken care of. The atmosphere is peaceful, the location stunning, and the experience unforgettable. It’s clear that the entire team takes great pride in creating a welcoming environment for their guests. I can’t wait to return; next time for a well-deserved holiday rather than work. Highly recommended!"
"15.","Anneli Påmark","4","2025-12-10","5","The gym is fantastic. Here is everything you need and I have got so much help and support from Yoga. I am so grateful and happy.😀🙏 The hotel is luxurious, and we have been exceptionally well taken care of. The breakfast buffet is excellent, and the large, beautiful pool was a real highlight. The hotel is located in a calm and peaceful area, which we truly appreciated."
"16.","RO LO","72","2025-12-17","5","The Meru is a dream come true! The minute you arrive at the hotel entrance you will be speechless from the grand car drop off with superb wooden roofing to the amazing corridor leading to the reception area. Everything is so thought through, from big to small details. The tropical suite are an impressive 85 sqm and again every little details has been thought through. The main restaurant offers a huge selection of both Indonesian, Asian and European food choices and having breakfast overlooking the sea is so peaceful. The architecture is amazing, not to mention its setting among lush plants and trees. Also a special thank you note to the Kids’ club staff, Ayu, Astro and Laksmi who made sure our daughter had a great time and was encouraged to play and do lots of interesting activities- which gave us a few hours of complete relaxation! It’s an hotel you’d not want to check out from!"
"17.","Ella N","83","2025-10-31","4","Our stay at The Meru Sanur was wonderful! The hotel was one of the most beautiful places we have ever stayed. The gardens are so lush, and the architecture is breathtaking. We spent most of our stay by the Meru pool, which was very enjoyable. The food and drink by the pool comes very quick, but there wasn’t a lot of shade, so we (and many others) had to move chairs during the day to follow the shade. There also was no shade in the pool, so if you’re sun conscious I might not recommend their pool. The rooms were definitely the best rooms we’ve ever had on our many visits to Bali. They were spacious, modern and well kept. The restaurant options were limited, but since The Meru is in such a great location in Sanur, there are many other restaurants close by outside the hotel, including the Icon Bali shopping mall which is a short walk away. We hope to return in the future!"
"18.","M. Fajar Aditia R","4","2025-12-01","5","Saya dan keluarga baru saja menyelesaikan masa menginap selama lima hari empat malam di The Meru Sanur. Secara keseluruhan, pengalaman kami sangat memuaskan dan meninggalkan kesan positif, terutama berkat profesionalitas serta pelayanan personal yang diberikan oleh tim manajemen hotel. Pelayanan Manajemen yang Sangat Responsif Pada hari pertama, saya sempat mengalami kendala terkait privasi di balkon kamar lantai satu, di mana terdapat teknisi yang melintas pada siang dan malam hari. Kondisi tersebut tentu mengurangi kenyamanan dan ketenangan kami. Namun, yang sangat saya apresiasi adalah respons cepat dan sikap solutif dari Pak Alit, selaku manajer hotel. Beliau menanggapi laporan kami dengan sangat baik, penuh empati, dan langsung memberikan kompensasi berupa upgrade kamar ke tipe yang lebih privat. Solusi tersebut bukan hanya memperbaiki pengalaman menginap kami, tetapi juga menunjukkan bahwa pihak manajemen benar-benar mengutamakan kenyamanan tamu. Kejujuran & Profesionalitas Staf Selain itu, saya ingin secara khusus menyampaikan terima kasih kepada Pak Prema. Suatu malam saya menggunakan buggy yang dikendarai beliau. Tanpa saya sadari, kamera saya tertinggal di buggy tersebut. Beruntung, kamera itu ditemukan dan dikembalikan dalam kondisi lengkap dan baik. Kejujuran serta profesionalitas seperti ini sangat berarti, dan benar-benar menambah rasa aman serta percaya kepada hotel dan seluruh timnya. Kesan Keseluruhan Pelayanan ramah, responsif, dan penuh perhatian membuat pengalaman kami di The Meru Sanur terasa lebih personal dan menyenangkan. Meskipun sempat ada kendala kecil, cara pihak hotel menanganinya menunjukkan standar hospitality yang sangat tinggi. Kami merasa dihargai sebagai tamu, dan hal inilah yang membuat The Meru Sanur layak direkomendasikan. Terima kasih kepada seluruh tim, khususnya Pak Alit dan Pak Prema, atas pelayanan luar biasa selama kami menginap. Kami sangat berharap dapat kembali di kesempatan berikutnya."
"19.","Mariam N","1","2025-10-31","5","We had an absolutely wonderful experience at your hotel’s kids’ club! A special thank you to Astri, Laksmi, Desak, and especially the amazing Ayu 😊 your warmth, kindness, and attentiveness made our children feel so happy and safe. The environment you’ve created is fantastic: clean, engaging, and above all, very safe. It was so reassuring to know our little ones were in such caring hands while we could relax. Thank you again for making our stay so memorable. Your dedication truly shines, and we hope to return soon!❤️🌸"
"20.","hilal dilmac","13","2025-10-31","3","The Meru Sanur is a nice hotel for a few days. I would not stay here longer then 6 days because it can get boring overtime. It is a nice stay based on the price however there are a few points which makes this resort a bit dissapointing. The restaurant for breakfast is the same every day. Although that is not a really big issue because there is plenty of choice. One thing that we think is not oke is the amount of stains on the plates and glasses. For a 5-star resort the cleanliness of the plates and glasses should be checked before placing them in the restaurant. The spa: 2 ladies of the spa came to us while we were at the pool and told us about the spa and the facilities. We were already thinking about taking a massage since this hotel was our last stop in Bali before heading back. We asked if they can make a good price for us if me and my husband would both book a massage and face treatment. Upon this they talked with their manager and told us they can give us 20%. A few days later we send a message telling them the days and time we would like to book the massage and face treatment and what the total cost will be. Upon this they said that based on our room number they could not give us the 20% anymore. I am sorry are we not worthy of the discount? They tried to scam us and tried to give us only 10% after knowing our room number. But after they knew our room number they would rather destroy the whole experience of the treatment. After having the discussion with them they offered us the 20% after all. Now it is just annoying and not a relaxing moment anymore so ofcourse we will not do the massage. The kids club: love love the teachers here, they are super creative and talented and super good with the children. I went to a lot of hotels but the teachers working here are outstanding! Overall I would advise this hotel for a short stay. Because it is close to some good restaurants and has a big pool and quit beach. But definitely needs some improvement."
"21.","Gegandek","263","2025-12-27","5","Menginap di The Meru Sanur memberikan pengalaman yang sangat menyenangkan. Hotelnya elegan, bersih, dan tenang. Kamar luas dan nyaman, fasilitas lengkap, serta pelayanan staf yang profesional dan ramah. Suasana resort cocok untuk relaksasi dan quality time. Sangat direkomendasikan untuk liburan."
"22.","Liudmyla Gapon","95","2025-08-31","5","I had a wonderful stay at Meru Sanur Bali. From the moment I arrived,i’m impressed by hospitality and attentiveness of all the resort staff, especially guest relationship Yunita, made me feel very welcome with her polite and attentive professional service. The room was spacious and very comfortable, adding to the relaxing atmosphere. The resort itself has a unique charm with its beautiful design and serene ambiance, making it a perfect place to unwind. Beach infront of the resort was clean, pool is nice, resort provides many activities for adults and kids: yoga, pilates, bike ride, balinese dance classes etc. The spa is beautiful, offering treatments that left me refreshed, and the breakfast was delicious with plenty of variety. I also recommend the seafood grill restaurant at the beach—the food was fresh and flavorful, perfectly enjoyed by the ocean. Overall, a truly memorable experience 🌴✨"
"23.","Monita Chan","5","2025-12-17","5","Hotel ini menurut saya merupakah salah satu hotel terbaik di area Sanur. Dengan interior design yang sangat menakjubkan setelah renovasi besar besaran. Kami melakukan yoga di pagi hari dengan Bli Kadek Agus, beliau merupakah instruktur yang sangat baik. kami sangat menikmati yoga pagi hari ini"
"24.","amer saleh","24","2025-12-01","5","We stayed for around three nights. Everything was great. The staff were always smiling and ready to support; they were very kind. The place was amazing, with a huge and beautiful reception area. Actually, you didn’t even need to chill outside the hotel — all the amenities were there, and it’s close to most of Sanur’s attractions"
"25.","Ferry The","5","2025-12-24","5","Room is very spacious and clean. And the hotel have a lot of activities including yoga in the morning in the garden with instructor Kadek Agus. It was a good session especially for beginner like me."
"26.","bagus setyawan","2","2025-12-01","5","first experience stay at The Meru Sanur and since arrive at hotel and check in everything is exceptional! Glad to met Deygus as my Ambassador. His genuine care and always ensure about my stay. Will come back soonly!! Love with room view at highest floor"
"27.","Peter Claes","9","2025-10-01","3","First impression Our first impression of the hotel was very positive – the entrance definitely has a wow factor! The room The room was clean and well-kept, exactly what you would expect in this price range. Points we would like to share (and also discussed with the staff): Breakfast area: Breakfast is shared with another hotel, which made it crowded and noisy. This was not communicated anywhere in advance and came as an unpleasant surprise. Resort pool: According to the rules, this pool is for adults and children over 6 only, and inflatables are not allowed. However, these rules were never enforced. During our 3-day stay, there were several younger children in the pool, which made it noisy. Although we mentioned this to the staff several times, no action was taken. Families are more than welcome to use the larger pool, but we specifically chose The Meru for the adults-only pool to enjoy peace and quiet – unfortunately, this did not work out. It would be helpful if staff actively enforced the rules so guests can truly relax by the pool. Happy Hour: Only cocktails were included in the promotion. Since we don’t drink alcohol, there was no option for a discounted mocktail. A missed opportunity. Personal touch: For a boutique-style hotel, it lacked any sense of personal touch. We felt more like a room number than a valued guest. At checkout, the staff did not even ask how our stay had been. “Free” minibar: This consisted of just one can of Coke, one can of Sprite, and one juice – replenished once per day. No diet or sugar-free options, which was disappointing. Lighting: The room had far too many light switches, making it unnecessarily confusing to operate. Safety: The hotel entrance is underground, which feels unsafe in case of a tsunami. There was no signage or indication of alternative escape routes, which left us feeling uneasy. Conclusion Compared to other hotels we stayed at in Bali, The Meru definitely stands out in terms of appearance and design. However, the overall experience and atmosphere are not quite there yet. We truly hope the hotel will make improvements, because the potential is certainly there."
"28.","Nitcha Ouu","13","2025-12-17","5","The service was good, the staff were friendly, and the breakfast and dinner were delicious. The swimming pool is right by the sea, the entrance is very large, the rooms are clean and have smart TVs. The hotel is close to a shopping mall and importantly, there's a piano available for guests to play 🫰🙏"
"29.","Babs Murphy","175","2025-08-31","5","Fabulous new hotel, open spaces decorated with local art. Staff is very professional, helpful and friendly. There is a large pool and the sea views are stunning. You can chose to eat in a few different restaurant all offer local and western cuisine. Great ambience, beautifully decorated and well mentained. The rooms are very large, modern and all facilities are top notch. The suits have a small private garden, where you can enjoy the lush, tropical plants around you. This is a modern, well run and top range hotel in Bali."
"30.","Rachael Kliese","3","2025-10-31","5","The most incredible resort I’ve ever visited. The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly, and the grounds and rooms were simply spectacular. Unfortunately our 18-month-old became quite ill during the trip. Which the staff went above and beyond, checking in on us every day and driving us in their buggy to and from a specialist. Having a world-class hospital right next door gave us real peace of mind, and the staff’s genuine care made a huge difference. 10/10 would recommend to everyone."
"31.","Eldric Sutardja","54","2025-10-31","5","One of the oldest hotels in Bali, recently renovated to look new and beautiful. First time but definitely not the last time! The walk from the drop off point up to the reception was grand, artsy and different than any Bali 5 star hotel I’ve been to. Great beach view from the room too! Room service was also quite tasty 👍🏼"
"32.","Livia Natasha","16","2025-12-24","5","The toilet is amaizing, there are 2 big pools, 1 is for meru and 1 for all both meru and bali beach, but unfortunately i feel like meru need more private place such as individuals breakfast restaurant, gym. The food is average, there are a lot of others have better breakfast food"
"33.","Kay Kisiah","30","2025-10-31","5","We had a wonderful experience at the Meru. Truly a 5 star hotel. The staff was amazing, the attention to detail was very impressive. We celebrated our anniversary while staying and can't wait to go back. Definitely worth the cost."
"34.","HellfireFN","1","2025-12-01","5","The fitness center is amazing, I love the pool and everything about this place is amazing. Agus is the best trainer and he is very good with his clients. The place is amazing and I recommend to everyone. Dika is such a sweet man and helped me so much with my room. Definitely a great guy and helped a lot."
"35.","Esa Pradnya","13","2025-12-24","5","Jatuh cinta dengan suasana di The Meru Sanur! Arsitekturnya megah tapi tetap terasa homey. Paling suka duduk di area balkon sambil menikmati angin laut. Lokasinya juga dekat dengan banyak kafe hits di Sanur, tapi tetap tenang di dalam area hotel. Benar-benar definisi luxury getaway yang sesungguhnya."
"36.","Pavlína Pěkná","10","2025-08-31","3","We didn’t really feel welcome during our stay here. The staff wasn’t very warm or friendly, and the overall service felt more like a 4-star hotel than a 5-star one. Service quality doesn’t match what we’ve experienced elsewhere in Bali – we received more genuine smiles in a 4-star hotel than here. Food and drinks are overpriced, and there isn’t even complimentary water by the pool, which is disappointing for a hotel in this category. The room was nice and clean, but the layout of the hotel is strange with lots of unused space and not enough sun loungers. One of the pools is shared with the hotel next door, which creates a lack of exclusivity for guests staying here. Breakfast was chaotic. We had to ask three times for drinks before they finally arrived. During check-out, the receptionist admitted that our room was noisy, but nobody mentioned this when we checked in. She didn’t seem very empathetic, didn’t thank us for our stay, and didn’t even ask if everything had been okay. Overall, it was disappointing for a supposed 5-star experience, and we wouldn’t stay here again."
"37.","Ravi Patel","34","2025-08-31","5","Splendid hotel! The true 5-star experience away from all the hustle and bustle of Bali. Right on the white sandy beach. Staff is so friendly and welcoming. We booked this place at the last minute and were blown away by how good the place was. Close to lots of local eateries, shopping strips and the new Icon Bali mall. Their breakfast spread is humongous. Glad that we decided to stay here. Will come back for sure."
"38.","Suman Atluri","12","2025-07-31","4","All in all a good experience, but definitely lots of room for improvement. Starting off with the good, the rooms are absolutely incredible and so is architecture. I would say even better than the website. Staff is very friendly, and eager to please. I feel like the problems come with the fact that the hotel is relatively new and they are definitely still working out some kinks. For context, the hotel is part of a larger complex of two other hotels. Some of the amenities, such as the pool, our private, while others are shared between all three. A perfect example of this is breakfast, which is shared between all three hotels. While the restaurant is quite big, and the selection was great, it really was truly a mess trying to get a table sometimes. So many families from all of the other hotels. I feel like at this price point, and given the fact that this hotel is the most premium in the complex, there should be a separate private breakfast, or a separate heating area. I think being part of this larger complex also cause some mild issues with things like food delivery and getting someone to help with bags. It would often take much longer than expected for someone to come after the Concierge was called. Again, not a huge deal, but at this price point,logistics should run a little bit smoother. All in all, Wood pay them another visit. I think with time and after growing pains, this could be an absolutely excellent property."
"39.","Abhilash Katkam","39","2025-10-01","5","We recently stayed at The Meru Sanur during our family trip to Bali, and it turned out to be one of our most memorable holidays. From the moment we arrived, the staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and comfortable. The highlight of our stay was celebrating our kids’s birthday at the hotel. The team put so much effort into making it special — from the thoughtful decorations to the warm hospitality, it truly felt like a home away from home. Our kids was over the moon, and we’ll cherish those memories forever. The property itself is beautiful, with well-maintained rooms, relaxing surroundings, and excellent amenities, specially SPA facility was awsome. The food was delicious, offering a variety of options to suit everyone in the family. We also appreciated the staff’s genuine kindness and professionalism throughout our stay. Overall, our experience was outstanding. We highly recommend The Meru Sanur to anyone visiting Bali, whether for a family holiday, special celebration, or just a relaxing getaway. We can’t wait to return!"

"41.","Ronitua Oni","19","2025-12-01","1","Layanan tidak baik Apakah karena SDM kurang? Kamar tidak dibersihkan sampai sore Laundry tidak diambil karena kamar tidak dibersihkan, SDH including harga kamar, hhmmmm.. Perlu pengaturan yang lebih baik Krn tidak semua tamu ingin kamarnya kotor sampai sore. Apabila memang rule nya adalah tamu HARUS MINTA kamarnya ingin dibersihkan tidak di sore hari, diinfokan dong saat check in. However weird policy ngga siy?"
"42.","Lindsay Paton","47","2025-10-31","5","Beautiful hotel, cannot rate this place enough. Two big pools, hotel staff are so lovely and welcoming. Great location in Sanur, beds were super comfy and if you leave do not disturb on they actually don’t disturb you, we had a great stay here at the Meru."

"44.","nadia ingrida","10","2025-08-31","5","The spa at The Meru is beautiful, with a calming interior featuring lovely rattan accents that create a warm and elegant atmosphere. The massage was excellent - the therapist was very skilled and even gave us helpful advice afterward about our muscle tension, which I really appreciated. The hydro sauna was amazing, and finishing with the ice bath was the perfect way to feel refreshed and re-energized. A truly wonderful experience, highly recommended!"
"45.","buyung yoga","23","2025-10-01","5","Pelayanan yang sangat baik. Datang ketika ada event di Meru jd agak penuh ketika hendak check in, beruntung segera bisa selesai prosesnya dan ramah sekali. Kolam renang sangat luas. Gratis 2-3 jam untuk anak bisa bermain di kidsroomnya dan dibantu jaga oleh petugasnya. Gratis pinjaman sepeda untuk berkeliling area hotel, Sanur, sangat menggembirakan. Lokasi strategsi dan dekat dengan Icon Mall, bisa langsung berjalan di area pinggi pantai untuk mencapainya. Pengalaman yang sangat berkesan. Semoga bisa segera berkunjung kembali. Terima Kasih dan Sukses Selalu 🙏🏻"
"46.","Kanchana Menon","25","2025-08-31","5","We had booked a deluxe ocean-view, twin-bed room at the Bali Beach Hotel. Eka, our Customer Experience Manager, changed the destiny of our stay by upgrading us to a suite at the Meru. He was personable and empathetic, accommodating all our requests during our stay. It is difficult to single out and appreciate any department as all staff are polite, warm, and always ready to help. Everything about the Meru Sanur and the Beach Bali Hotel is sure to amuse - from the architecture, lighting, and flora, to the incredible attention to detail the staff pays to their guests and for the upkeep of the property.

Dan kami tau bahwa akses ke pool tidak ada krn tidak menginap… awal pertama breakfast kira2x dua minggu lalu pelayanan staf lobi sd restaurant sangat rekomended. Untuk hari ini bertepatan dengan hari saraswati kami bermaksud untuk breakfast kedua krn sklian mau mandi kepantai….. krn hanya untuk keperluan melukat kami hanya sebentar dipantai, dan segera bilas di tmp yg disediakan disebelah pool krn kami berencana segera sarapan…. Saat bilas bersama keluarga, kami didatangi petugas pool yg menanyakan kami tamu atau bukan dengan penuh curiga dan tidak ramah. Setelah menjelaskan bahwa kami rencana hanya breakfast dan petugas bilang bahwa banyak yg hanya berpura2x breakfast padahal tidak tetapi akses masuk ke pool… kami sudah jelaskan bahwa kami tidak suka pool (dengan bbrpa pertimbangan dll) hanya untuk melukat kami sklian breakfast kali kedua ke meru. Mungkin saran sebaiknya komunikasi staf pool agak lebih ramah dan tidak men-judge seseorang spt diatas mskpun kami bukan WNA. kami lokal tetapi kami mengerti peraturan di hotel2x dan kami untuk breakfast masih bisa untuk bayar di meru. Semoga meru tetap menjadi pilihan wisatawan baik asing maupun lokal kedepannya… santhi2 🙏🙏🙏"

Booked the premier suite and the outlook was dark and enclosed Requested upgrade, but nothing was available so I was offered a downgrade option with a better outlook however no compensation for the large difference in room rate was offered – so we stayed put The room came with a butler whom there was no contact from for our stay and we were advised that the bar fridge was fully stocked and replenished as part of the room rate – there were only four items in there, and they were not replenished at all during our four day stay The resort itself is quite visually spectacular – however it is quite sterile and has a very confused floor plan with many pathways leading nowhere – some in circles with no purpose Very disappointing as Senur is beautiful, and had lots of facilities and lovely restaurants within walking distance but we would not stay at this hotel again"
"51.","Shana Lee","3","2025-07-01","5","We just finished 10 nights at The Meru, lt was our most luxurious and relaxing holiday we have ever had. We are already looking at coming back this year. The second level rooms were spacious and exceptionally clean. Every attention to detail has been thought of. The rooms are dark and quiet and the beds ridiculously comfortable. We ate at the restaurant with a young toddler who thoroughly enjoyed breakfast and dinner every night. The Sunday brunch is a must do experience. We were treated to a massage at the spa, the best massage we had had. The staff go above and beyond to make you feel welcome and cared for. They were extremely helpful in helping us source baby items to hire. We were able to use hotel bikes to enjoy a beach side ride most mornings. We have stayed at many of the big name luxury resorts in Bali and this was by far the best experience we have ever had."

We made an advance booking for the spa and were very pleased with the massage — special thanks to Bepin, Putri, and Rita for their excellent work. We also requested an early breakfast at 3am for our dolphin-watching trip, and the hotel kindly prepared it for us right on time — much appreciated! If there’s any area for improvement, it would be the quality of the hotel room towels, which didn’t quite match the feel of a luxury hotel. Also, the water pressure in the shower could be better."

Jadi saya wisuda dengan akt 2021 lainnya berjumlah 4k org di ruangan aula conventionnya. Tempatnya bisa dibilang luas sekali, wisudanya berjalan lancar dengan bantuan fasilitas mendukung kyk layar proyektor yg luas, lampu sorot, dll. Parkir bisa diarahkan oleh satpam/petugas, jika situasi parkir jauh tersedia juga mobil buggy untuk mengantar kalian. Saran saya diusahakan agar sinyal internet dalam ruangan aula berjalan lancar, mungkin bisa ditambahkan sesuatu untuk mendukung pancaran sinyal"
"58.","Ryan Kim","989","2025-07-01","5","The Meru Sanur is a hidden gem in Sanur, Bali. The resort offers spacious suites with elegant interiors that blend modern design with traditional Balinese touches. The rooms are incredibly comfortable, and the beachfront location adds a serene, luxurious vibe. The breakfast was excellent, with a good variety of local and international dishes. The pool area is beautifully maintained, and the staff are very friendly and attentive. I especially appreciated the quiet, relaxing atmosphere – perfect for a peaceful getaway. If you're looking for a high-end stay in Sanur with great service and beautiful surroundings, this place is definitely worth it."

Me and my fried trying to have a good dinner at Arunika Restaurant but turn out become really worst. 1. We did request the food with no mushroom but the food keep coming with it, the server blame the kitchen and told me the kitchen team was erorr(?) you guys seems not serious with guest food especially for any request… i mean what if my friend have allergic and die at your restaurant(?) 2. We asked for the bill, but our dessert not come out yet and they already put it on the bill to pay(?) 3. After we told them about the dessert and they were sorry to forgot it (?) and it was strawberry cake: taste horrible like it was not mean to be eaten (my other friend throw up because of this cake). I have never read what’s ingredients on that cake but it was recommendation from where I reserve the table. I felt shame to my friends because i was invited them to eat here and turn out disappointed. The hotel was lovely but the restaurant service is The worst, they forgot everything :(("

Plus, The Meru let their convention center rent by Hillsong Church. May God bless The Meru, use this place to become blessing, give healing, all good things. Was stay here during power outage in Bali. So this place such an escape place and God indeed provide us to stay 2 nights and we save here. Very calm place, private. We got photo session as a complimentary. All staff are really nailed it. They do their best for us. I enjoy playing piano there. Will come back here!"

"65.","Jbar","6","2025-08-31","4","We stayed in this hotel for our wedding anniversary, my husband gave me a surprise for celebrate our special day, staff so friendly and helpful, but there's something missing, my husband already book this hotel with request high floor, no smoking, quiet, and put some flowers and cake anniversary including number our marriage on 12th, but unfortunately request he asked all wrong, they give us room high floor but noisy because construction above our room, and they doesn't communicate between staff so they doesn't know about that construction. Plus they give our room connecting door next to us , means next door stay with noisy kids. And what mistake again they already prepare us wishing card, cake anniversary on the day we arrive on 11, that supposed on 12th with name and year wrong. So we no idea how they get name wrong and age of anniversary not even belong us on cake and card. So after we complain about the room they show us room on third floor with swimming pool view, but we cant stay yet because they still clean, and we agree to move but have to wait, so staff ask us to go back to room and inform us if they finish. So we wait... We wait, already hour long and still nothing, until we complain by phone, not done yet. Another half hour wait my hubby decided to go to receptionist to complain and they told us 10 minute more even after that, we hear nothing, we very disappointed because we don't want spend our day just hassle room. And not long some staff nama Bpk Gunawan come to our room and offer deluxe executive, what a nice him, thank you pak. So happy we move and they upgrade our room much better than before. About request cake and make up with flowers maybe can be better because its to simple, even if there have to cost will be nice to inform. First night sleep is great but.... Second nite we stay another come problem. Some idiots making noisy at 11.30 pm while we just slept on 10, in restaurant area, talking, laughing so loud and we complain on the phone 3 x for asking them be quiet but staffs only say they gonna watch over them, welll.... Look they group of people doesn't even stop, we continue to be disturbed for another hour, listening to drunk people shouting and making a lot of noise, I've seen the staff who don't do anything so I the one who screaming to shut up. It's work!!! Finally peace and quoet at 1am, but this should not be my job. Maybe management can be more straight and discipline to customer or anyone who disturbing because we choose this hotel to have a relaxed quiet time for our special day. A little bit sad what happened. But for all this Hotel have beautiful place and design. Thank you."
"66.","Charisma Indah","24","2025-07-31","5","I’m slightly disappointed with the interior of the room—specifically, the ceiling design on the 3rd floor, which looks different from those on the 1st and 2nd floors. My room was originally supposed to be on the 1st floor, but I requested to be moved to a higher floor. I asked the staff to confirm that the interior design would be the same on every floor, and they assured me there were no differences. However, they failed to mention that the ceiling on the 3rd floor has a different visual design, which doesn’t match the images shown on the online booking platform. Other than that, everything else was incredibly good and impressive. The ideas for birthday celebrations were also great—definitely worth trying!"

Truly the best service we could ask for. Highly recommended!"
"68.","host23 Goen","888","2025-08-31","4","Nice rooms, it s just too bad some of the construction quality is not the best, e.g installation of shower faucet was not simetric and create a big crack on the marble, which they half ass repaired it with resin. Love the ulin and bengkirai wood though. Service for the most part is good, only some crews with black shirt were not as friendly. Location is superb with direct access to the beach where you can use it to visit cafe, bars, restaurants, and Icon mall. Breakfast is quite variative, mostly are tasted decent. There is kids club but it is quite small and mediocre."

The warm welcome, complete with refreshments and treats, instantly set the tone for a relaxing stay. Check-in took a bit longer, but we appreciated that they were preparing our room just as we had requested—worth the wait! The ambience, food, interior design, and especially the service were all top-notch. Every detail felt thoughtfully curated. One of the highlights was our dinner at Arunika Restaurant. We had a blast enjoying the delicious pomelo salad and perfectly cooked steak—definitely recommend trying it! Our kids loved spending time at the kids club and were so happy playing with the kind and caring staff. It gave us parents a little break too 😊 And a special moment for my husband—our stay coincided with the Indonesian national football team staying there, and he got to meet some of his idols. Totally unexpected and unforgettable! All in all, it was the perfect choice for a family holiday in Bali. We’ll definitely be back. Thank you, The Meru Sanur, for a beautiful and memorable stay! 🌺"

Point for improvement - Breakfast can be improved in terms of variety and taste; it is far behind other famous 5-star hotels in Bali. - Valet parking service: please hire more staff to stand by during peak hours (sometimes we wait almost 20 minutes just to get our car delivered, which is really annoying). - free photo session service; the admin are really not friendly (I believe they're external vendors), and please put a clear statement in the beginning that the photos are not free; the photographer charged us IDR 180K/photo, which is quite expensive But other than that, everything is superb. Will be back for sure. Once again, huge thanks to Bu Yunita for all the help to make our stay there even more enjoyable."
"74.","Jessica Tesalonika","5","2025-07-31","1","Hello The Meru, I had a disappointing experience at your location today. Whether it involved your own staff or those from The Sanur, the issue lies with the people working there—specifically your parking staff. Their attitude was unacceptable, showing a clear lack of manners and professionalism. I, along with several others, had to wait over 30 minutes just to exit the parking area. It was evident that the management was unprepared to handle a high-traffic situation. While The Meru is undeniably a beautiful and well-designed place, the staff behavior and lack of coordination seriously tarnish the overall experience. I hope you take this feedback seriously and improve staff training and crowd management moving forward. Thank you."

The resort itself is stunning, spacious, and incredibly comfortable. Everything from the rooms to the pool areas is beautifully maintained and thoughtfully designed. It’s definitely worth every bit of what you pay for. But what truly made our stay unforgettable was the incredible service, especially from Yudi, the resort ambassador. He was an absolute star. From the moment we arrived, he made sure we felt welcome, comfortable, and genuinely taken care of. You could tell he truly cares about the guests and always checking in to make sure we were happy, offering helpful tips, and just going out of his way to make everything perfect. His warmth and attention to detail really made our experience extra special. The rest of the staff were also fantastic , super friendly, attentive, and professional. It’s clear that service is a priority here. And the food! The restaurant on site is absolutely delicious. Every meal we had was fresh and full of flavor All in all, The Meru Sanur exceeded our expectations in every way. We’d come back in a heartbeat …especially if we get to see Yudi again!"

We finally arrived at this relatively brand new swanky hotel the Meru Sanur at around 3.10pm. massive lobby yet only a handful of people registering guests. We were told to wait. Got fed up at 3.30pm . Only because of that someone attended to us. Next in our welcome was the discovery that two inclusions recorded on email confirmation were not in fact available. Then more apologies our room is not ready. Bear in mind check in is 3pm. So we are directed to bar for complimentary canapes. When we get there the tables are dirty and the food all gone. See images It is now 4.25pm. no sign of any one."
"86.","Hendra Wennady","83","2025-03-31","5","We come here around March. They greeted us with welcome ceremony, a welcome drink, and very helpful receptionist. The entry hall is amazing and magical, it is very symbolic and so Indonesian. The reception hall is nice too, and this reception area also used by Bali Beach Hotel. Our Tropical Suite rooms were ready soon and it was amazing. There were fruits, very personalized free mini bar in the fridge and snacks (they adjust it for senior people, and young family with kids). The pool is big and amazing. We can rent bikes too in the hotel, so we can use it on the beachside. The breakfast variation is good, and it was actually good. 5 star hotels and very recommended. I will surely return to stay here in the future. By the way there were 2 negative points that this hotel should improve: 1. There was 50k rupiah charge for 1 delivery from concierge area to your room 2. it is very dark on the night, and i can easily get lost my way back to the room"
"87.","のづ","25","2025-05-31","5","I stayed one night on the ground floor, and the environment and facilities were truly befitting of a luxury hotel. It was a peaceful and relaxing stay. Here are some highlights that made the experience exceptional: • The view from the room felt like a mini jungle. The landscaping was beautifully maintained and simply mesmerizing to look at. • The private pool was amazing—clean, quiet, and incredibly comfortable. • The room was modern and spotless, and soaking in the bathtub while enjoying the garden view was absolutely delightful. • There was a cute welcome display waiting for us. It was the first time I had seen towel art that wasn’t a crane—such a nice touch! • The beach is just a short walk away, allowing us to enjoy the sunrise just five minutes after waking up. • A shopping mall is also accessible on foot along the beach, about 10–15 minutes away. There were just a couple of minor drawbacks: • The service lead time was a bit slow. I requested a bottle opener by phone at night, and it took 30 minutes to arrive. In other international luxury hotels, this typically takes around five minutes. • The quality of the breakfast was somewhat disappointing. While the variety was impressive, the taste was closer to that of a business hotel. That said, the coffee was excellent."

What truly sets it apart however is the standard of service. We were checked in on daily to see if everything was good, we mentioned we would like a certain tea bag and they then restocked this daily. The level of friendliness and attentiveness from the staff was incredible- from Sri our regular “personal butler” to the staff at any of the restaurants, at the pool etc."

Off course I am enjoying our 3 nights staying here until tomorrow (at the time of writing is my last night staying here). There are two swimming pool. One is in Olympic size and the others although not as big as the others also quite big. There are Children Play Room and free using bike for 3 hours. Breakfast very good. Its location at sanur just next door of Bali Beach Hotel, and quite near ti The Icon Bali."

"103.","Metta Mets","3","2025-07-01","2","Hari ini sangat bad experience! Buruk!! Kalau ga sanggup ngatasin parkiran mending ga usah ngadain event gede di hotel!! Parkiran diutamakan ke peserta event?! Terus penghuni hotel dan customer resto yang sudah bayar gimana? Hampir hangus loh duit saya karena ga ada parkiran doang!! Tanya staff malah dilempar2, ditanya solusi ga tau, alasannya juga ga tau karena parkiran overload?!! Kronologi: sy ada reservasi di arunika restaurant, sudah reservasi dari h-5 tapi ternyata berpas2an dengan event running yang diadakan di hotel dan saya tidak diinfokan sebelum reserv kalau ada event diadakan hari ini. Awal datang pelayanan sudah jelek. Parkir hotel full sehingga diarahin satpam untuk ke valley, tiba di valley diinfokan juga parkiran overload. Akhirnya saya protes karena sudah DP resto dan tidak bisa dicancel, sy ga terima dong uang saya hangus karena kesalahan hotel yang tidak kompeten. Staffnya malah ga ngasih solusi, bilang nya “saya juga ga tau mbak, parkirannya lagi overload juga ini” what the??!! Untungnya di sini ada 1 staff wanita yang nawarin buat parkir di rumah sakit hotel dan nanti dijemput boogey untuk ke lobby hotel. Kata mbak nya nanti minta boogey lagi kalau mau ke parkiran untuk ambil mobil. Nyatanya apa? Ga ada. Boogey habis kepakai semua! Jadinya sy terpaksa jalan kaki dari lobby hotel ke rumah sakit pakai heels dicuaca panas seperti ini! Ga lagi2 deh ke sini. Niatnya ngerayain hari spesial malah dapat pengalaman buruk di sini. 👎🏻👎🏻"

The rooms are spacious and have some best in class amenities, the architecture of the whole resort is magnificent. We seriously didn't want to leave! Go ahead, book yourself in. You'll have the best time at the Meru!"
"105.","Karina Adianto","233","2025-07-31","5","Previously Grand Inna Bali Beach Hotel before renovated, now the Meru Sanur is one of the best hotel in Bali. From the drop off area to the lobby we're going down the stairs. It's like going inside a hallway of a modern art gallery. On the left & right sides we could see conclaves with statue of different goddess at the end of it. In between us and the statue there were mirrors, which at some angle, the view became infinite. On that tunnel; the reflective ceiling surface, textured stone wall, shiny polished stone floor and the indirect lighting on the bottom along the way were not your ordinary point of view. The temperature sensed lower, the time seemed slower, the strong wind refreshed your mind and i felt at peace. The whole entrance and the lobby area were designed meticulously, as it gave out the strong impact of first impression. It embedded trangulity in the space with the used of wood and stone elements across the interior. The drizzling water sounds from the fountains, the soft music enhance the serene vibe. In the arrival lounge, the lighting creates beautiful calming ambiance. Shadows on the wooden wall partitions. The strips of light in between the 'almost' floor to ceiling bookshelves / ornamentation displays. Wifi didn't work in the arrival lounge, but i didn't mind at all. We're eligible for the complimentary Lounge Access because we booked the hotel room through the travel agent. It was served everyday from 5-6.30pm near the arrival lounge. Juices, crackers, nuts, cookies, fruits, canapes and even wines were provided. We were always looking forward for the special treatment and glad we got the privilege because not all had the access to it. The room was well designed and layed out perfectly. One of the few hotel rooms which could accomodate our needs. The entrance area was spacious, separated from the bedroom by a sliding door with holes. There's a cupboard filled with plenty of water, tea & coffee. A can of coke, pocari sweat & a little milk were also provided inside the fridge. The bedroom's ceiling was high. There's an L-shaped sofa on the corner. Long working desk across the wall under the big tv monitor. A narrow sofa infront of the bed. The bathroom with bath tub, toilet cubicle, walk in robe & a dressing table with a huge mirror were in one area, with a sliding door separating the bedroom area. It was very convinient when my hubby & son were still sleeping and i was wide awaked already. I could read and did other stuffs in the dressing area without disturbing the sleepyheads. Room for improvement: - Seatings in the drop off area. We were waiting for our taxi, and it took a while because of the traffic jam. We didn't have anywhere to sit during that 15 minutes of waiting. - Seating in the entrance of the room where the big mirror & bar cabinet were. We needed it to put on our shoes comfortably. Notes: A charge of 50k if you want your Gofood orders to be send to your room. The beach unfortunately was not a private beach, but it's just across the hotel and easily access. I will review the wonderful breakfast buffet at Arunika Restaurant by The Meru Sanur and dinner at Roso restaurant."

"107.","Ong Ting Yong","258","2025-05-31","4","We stayed at Meru and were very impressed by the room—spacious, clean, and excellent value for money. The hotel facilities were top-notch, and the staff, in general, were attentive. If you’re planning to stay within the hotel grounds, it’s a solid choice and a much better option than Bali Beach Hotel. That said, there were a few letdowns. The location feels a little out of place and isolated, which can be inconvenient if you want to explore. The beach was coarse and not well-maintained—definitely not the relaxing experience we were hoping for. What really disappointed me was a booking error by the staff. They quoted me the wrong price for a day trip and ended up mishandling the reservation entirely. I had to make last-minute arrangements with an external vendor. Also, the food was mediocre at best—not something I’d return for. Overall, I had quite a decent experience and would recommend it to my friends coming to Bali for consideration."

"113.","Valencia Kam","4","2025-07-01","1","Calling this a 5-star hotel feels… ambitious. Sure, the building is stunning and the interior design is a treat for the eyes, very Instagrammable, 10/10 for vibes. But service? Let’s just say it’s giving “first week of internship.” As in-house guests, we had the honor of being completely sidelined. No food deliveries allowed, no freedom to come or go, all because government officials were staying. Apparently, the hotel’s definition of hospitality includes locking down paying guests in the lobby for four hours without proper solutions. If there is no SOP regarding this, maybe don’t accept public bookings during VIP events? Just a thought. Many couriers are left frustrated thanks to the hotel’s rigid and inconsiderate SOPs. This hotel even had the audacity to complain to my travel agent because of my request to deliver package to my room because they say no other hotels do this anymore and that I should check. Maybe they should. Also, a little advice to the directors: being gracious to guests is not optional at this level — being condescending isn’t a luxury perk."

From the moment I arrived, I was blown away by the hotel's stunning architecture and beautifully landscaped gardens. The room was truly amazing - a spacious suite that felt like a luxurious private villa. The decor was elegant and modern, with all the amenities you could possibly need. And the best part? The room was enormous, with plenty of space to relax and unwind. But what really impressed me was the hotel's incredible pool facilities. Not one, but two huge pools that seemed to stretch on forever. The perfect place to soak up the sun, take a leisurely swim, or simply relax with a cool drink. The atmosphere at the hotel was also very nice, with a relaxed and peaceful vibe that made me feel like I was a million miles away from the stresses of everyday life. And with the hotel's picturesque beachfront location, I could stroll along the shore, take a bike ride, or simply sit back and enjoy the breathtaking views. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxurious and unforgettable 5-star experience. The rooms, facilities, and atmosphere are all top-notch, and the hotel's beautiful beachfront location is the icing on the cake. Tooopp!!!!"
"117.","Georgia Heideman","8","2025-03-03","5","We had the privilege of staying at the Meru Hotel in Sanur for our honeymoon, and it was absolutely unforgettable. From the moment we arrived, we felt like royalty. The staff went above and beyond to make sure we had the best possible stay. They made us feel so special, checking in daily with messages to see if we needed anything. Every staff member, without fail, greeted us with a warm smile and a friendly hello. The level of care and attention to detail is unmatched. The hotel itself is stunning—both the rooms and the pools were beautiful and impeccably maintained. One of our favorite parts was the complimentary use of bikes, which allowed us to explore the area at our own pace. Sanur is such a charming location, and having bikes made it even more enjoyable. This hotel truly stands out as the best we've ever stayed in, not only for its facilities but because of the incredible people who work there. The hospitality we experienced was second to none, and we felt genuinely cared for. We loved it so much, we even extended our stay by an extra night! Without a doubt, I would recommend the Meru Hotel to anyone visiting Sanur. It's an experience we will cherish forever, and I would return in a heartbeat. A million times over, I would recommend this incredible resort to anyone!"

We had a really helpful butler which we appreciated. Every evening, they offer coffee time where each room can get two cups of coffee drinks and have small snacks at the lobby.

"128.","steve makins","85","2025-07-31","5","Meru is a fabulous 5 star hotel. Located on beach front and beach walk with expansive grounds and two pools, easy to relax and indulge and avoid intense traffic of Bali. Beaches OK on sand but coral reef means no paddling in calm water without rubber soles shoes to protect feet. For runners an early 4km run on board walk is good but some days walkers and cyclists make it slow. The walk will highlight just how superior Meru is! Main meals area too exposed to weather no wind or rain protection. Indonesian restauarant in adjoining Bali hotel had realkt goodbmeal options. We had breakfast and 1 main meal package and ate alm meals at the hotel tk feel food secure. Staff are so so friendly. Like every one of them makes an effort. Pools are huge and warm, great.swimming. the entrance walk and reveption is initially dark and imposing but every time you go there it impresses more. Avoid reef tours as too long to get there and get tj island and back for small time seeing fish etc. Icon shopping centre less than 2km walk is familiar superior.brand retail therapy! Walks along main road maybe 2km away husband mix of good boutiques and confronting lifestyle/ emerging businesses. Would.i go back? If I went back to Bali then YES"

It’s a perfect retreat for couples, though perhaps less suited for families. The breakfast experience was exceptional, offering a delicious variety of cuisines with a view of the expansive pool and serene beach. Their newly renovated gym, equipped with modern facilities, was a great addition to the stay. The arrival passageway, adorned with statues and waterfalls, can feel a bit eerie if you arrive at night, but in the daylight, it transforms into a beautiful and welcoming sight. Overall, it was a thoroughly enjoyable stay, blending comfort, aesthetics, and convenience seamlessly."
"131.","Stefanie Maria","4","2025-07-01","2","The nice hotel with super low class service… 1. Check in took me an hour because they ask me to wait at the lobby and gave me some welcome and drink and completely forgot about me until i asked after an hour 2. The drain at the shower area clogged 2 times 3. They need an hour to send french fries to the room 4. We come to arunika at 4.45 and asking to sit at the table near the pool and they said its reserved at 6.00 pm . So we said okay and we sit at other table . But until we finish our meal at 7.00 the table is still empty and they wouldn't let us use it . 5. During breakfast i asked to one of the staff what kind of muffin is this. 1 person said vanila bomboloni which is i know thats incorrect and i asked them again they said they dun know because they are service and ask me to looking for pastry person . Where the hell i know which one is pastry people .so they ask kitchen person to attend And 1 person said it is english muffin So i asked what is inside . And the person said its banana and when my kids eat it its actually blueberry and cashew muffin (they just answer without think lucky my son doesnt have an allergy reaction And i was asking about when they are refill the bubur ketan hitam . And it tooks them an hour with 4 different people answering me 1 said i dont know 1 said lemme check to the kitchen 1 said im new here 1 said they have to cook again in different kitchen Fyi the breakfast isnt free thou… we have to pay for it so we expect to eat what we want on the buffet. And you guys make it complicated This hotel is just nice on the outlook and the room but they shud train their staff better. The way they answer to customer is really2 bad… i found the cleaning sevice and the bellboy is the most helpful and nice person Even during check out The lady is not friendly at all Not asking how is out stay and so on Just want us to settle our own bill and go So i decided to just write the review. For us who always love bali and we always stay in big name hotel like under marriot or hilton . We found The meru service is really not 5 star after all. Come back here again or recommend to our family and friend? I dont think so… Thanks"

"135.","Mehar Mehar","10","2025-05-31","1","This was honestly one of the worst hotel experiences I’ve ever had. I stayed at The Meru Sanur and I seriously regret every dollar spent. We paid $1,100+ for what felt like a night in a furnace. The AC didn’t work, and we were sweating through two whole days and nights, unable to sleep, constantly shifting rooms, and begging for someone to fix it. Their excuse? “Bali is hot.” Are you serious? Every decent hotel knows how to handle weather — that’s the bare minimum. This isn’t a shack on the beach — it’s supposed to be a luxury property. They did nothing to compensate for our discomfort — no gesture, no concern, no effort. Just fake smiles and pathetic excuses. If I wanted to roast in a sauna, I’d go to one — not pay over a thousand dollars for a room that feels like an oven. The place looks nice, but what’s the point when you can’t even breathe comfortably in your room? Complete waste of money. Just throwing cash in the fire would have been more peaceful. Save yourself the pain. Unless you enjoy sweating through your clothes and paying luxury prices for zero sleep — don’t even think of booking this place. Savitri didn’t help us at all. No gesture, no solution — just blank apologies that meant nothing. After wasting two days in heat and discomfort, the least she could’ve done was show some basic courtesy. Disappointing."
"136.","rijanto joesoef","101","2025-07-01","5","This is a very good hotel to stay not more than 3-4 days. Need some hand-railing in some areas.

"137.","Daria Goroshko","44","2025-05-01","2","We stayed at this hotel last weekend. While the overall design and ambiance were beautiful, the service was shockingly poor – especially considering the hotel positions itself as a luxury five-star property in Bali. The rooms are comfortable, authentic, and very well soundproofed. The entire property is beautifully maintained and peaceful, which we really appreciated. Based on the interior and comfort, I would rate the hotel a solid 9 out of 10. Unfortunately, the service doesn’t match the setting – it was slow, careless, and frankly unacceptable for this price point. Housekeeping was a major issue. Our room wasn’t cleaned at all during the day, and when we returned in the evening and asked for it to be done, it still hadn’t been touched an hour and a half later. We had to ask again, and it took about 2.5 hours in total before the room was finally cleaned. Even then, they forgot to replace towels and restock some amenities. Breakfast was another frustrating experience. It’s advertised as running until 10:30, and in most hotels that means you can enter until 10:30 and still have time to enjoy the buffet. But here, 10:30 meant sharp closure. Staff started clearing the buffet exactly at 10:30, without any notice or grace period, and food was literally taken away right in front of us. In one instance, I was walking toward a dish, and a staff member sped up to remove it before I could get to it. It turned out there was a private event that morning, but no one communicated this or offered an à la carte alternative – which would be standard at any proper five-star hotel. Even worse, my sister stayed the night before with her husband and their one-year-old daughter and ordered a simple meal – pasta with broccoli – for the baby. It took 3 hours to arrive!!! The child’s mother had to call the restaurant every 10–15 minutes to remind them. They kept forgetting, losing the order, and making excuses. Eventually, the parents had to leave and feed the child another way. That kind of service is simply unacceptable anywhere, but especially in a hotel of this caliber. A basic need – feeding a baby – should never be neglected like this. In summary: interior and surroundings – wonderful. Service – a complete disaster. I would rate the staff and service 1 out of 10."
"138.","B S","822","2025-05-31","5","The hotel is indeed beautiful. Other facilities feel like they are being slammed when compared to the design of the lobby and rooms. For example: The swimming pool is large, but only a box, the gym is okay, complete but plain, the kids club seems small and crowded, the restaurant is also outdoor and less exciting, but the service is okay. As soon as you arrive, you are immediately helped to unload your belongings, given a splash of water and a bracelet. Check-in is escorted to the lobby. From the drop-off to the lobby, it is not very kid-friendly because you have to use stairs. Along the way from the drop-off to the lobby, we will be presented with various statues that are beautifully designed with flowing water behind them, making an elegant impression. The design of the lobby and rooms is once again very beautiful! Upon arrival at the lobby, you are asked to sit down and given a welcome towel and welcome drink. Check-in took a bit long, 15 minutes, until I got bored (even though the lobby design was awesome). Unfortunately, in Bali during the rainy season, there was a slight design flaw in the first statue on the left, when it rains the water overflows to the road area leading to the lobby, from day to night there are staff sweeping the water. After that we headed to the room. It was quite far from the lobby but it paid off because the room was really beautiful. I really like the design of the bedhead panel, and the sofa area which is given a bird wallpaper motif plus the orange pillow color. The room is very spacious plus the design is really beautiful, as soon as you enter on the left there will be a free minibar containing, cashew nuts, coconut chips, tea using the Dharma brand, coffee capsules using the Tanamera brand, Balinese chocolate, mango juice, orange juice and 1 small box of Greenfield milk. The room is equipped with a sofa in front of the TV, an L-shaped sofa and a table for coffee. There is a long table and chairs for work but it is not comfortable. The balcony is spacious with a sofa, table and chairs, can view garden and ocean. The mattress is soft and comfortable to sleep soundly. Towards the bathroom there is a walk-in closet with a dominant light brown color, there is a luggage rack, a dressing table that is proper for both work and eating. The closet already has a heater and electricity, there is only 1 washbasin but complete amenities. Shower with rain shower and beautiful bathtub. Complete amenities soap shampoo using sensatia botanica. Hot water flows smoothly without any problems. Like the design especially behind the shower there is an LED strip that adds an elegant impression, The facilities include a special swimming pool for the Meru and a cluster swimming pool with Bali beach hotel, kids club, gym, spa, garden, access to Sanur Beach, free bicycle rental, unfortunately there is still work in various places so it is a bit disturbing the peace. The swimming pool water is cold, at night it is a bit dark and there are not enough lights. Evening cocktail There are crackers, nuts, fruits, almond cake muffins, beef satay, green pea tartlet, coffee tart, focaccia, cheese stick, red wine, white wine. Unfortunately when I arrived half an hour before it ended, many had run out, it was only refilled 10 minutes before it ended. Luckily it was still refilled. Breakfast at Arunika Restaurant, outdoor, quite hot, luckily there was a fan, there were many variants. It's just that the taste is actually good, but for a 5-star class, honestly it's still a bit bland or not kicking enough. Menu: 1.

The food in the attached restaurant, which shares the Meru and Bali Beach Hotel was always a highlight, both in the morning at the breakfast buffet and in the evening. But we were most impressed by the hospitality and the service of the hotel staff. We would like to thank Mr. Rio in particular and wish him all the best."

"142.","Daniel Fisher","24","2025-07-01","5","Probably the best hotel we’ve ever been to. The architecture has to be seen to be believed. The rooms are fantastic. The food (even buffet) is truly restaurant quality. Most of all the service is truly 5 stars. Every day you’re assigned a “resort ambassador” person to take care of you, conveniently through a WhatsApp channel you can text, who will take care of anything you need - we accidentally broke a glass in the room and they’d cleaned it up in and out in 10 minutes. They’d notice if you’re at the pool and ask if you’d like your room cleaned whilst you were away. It really makes you feel like a celebrity. In particular, Kia who seems to run the service in the restaurant is such a lovely person, anything you need she’s almost psychic, remembers your coffee order, and is just a lovely person to have a chat with. Another standout was Yunita, who was our resort ambassador on a day with a bunch of problems with wifi away from the room. She went so far as to investigate what was going on from a tech perspective, triage and fix the issue, all in about 25 mins, and ensure that my devices had great internet the rest of the trip. Everyone we interacted with went above and beyond and whilst there was a few tiny hiccups they were always addressed straight away. And most importantly, everyone who works here seems genuinely happy, like they love their jobs and like they’ve been treated well. We will definitely be back, probably once a year!"
"143.","Xinwei Toh","17","2025-07-01","5","Absolutely stunning resort hotel in Sanur. The ground floor room we chosen comes with a private garden with daybed overseeing the resort pool. All the service staff were friendly and warm. Loves the 90 mins deep tissue massage at Savasna Spa which was truly a godsent to ease all the tired muscle knots. The poolside menu was extensive and fish and chips was great! Also a shoutout to the kids’ club service staff who were all very friendly so much that my son enjoys going there everyday during our stay. There’s a lot planned daily activities to keep guests engaged and we took the aqua aerobics which was pretty fun! Gym facilities were great with all the essential equipment and segmented zones for different purposes. Would recommend Meru to others exploring the area too."

"149.","Milou Vaal","42","2025-03-31","2","Unfortunately, our stay at The Meru Sanur was a major disappointment. We had expected a special, tranquil, and unique hotel, but instead, we found ourselves in the middle of a construction site. The large swimming pool was under complete construction, with heavy work being done on it every day. This caused a lot of noise, especially during breakfast, as the pool is located right next to the main restaurant. The spa building was also still under construction, which was both visible and audible daily. Additionally, extensive work was being carried out around the hotel and on the surrounding grounds. Walking around during the day, the predominant sound was that of construction. This should have been communicated when making a booking because I would never have chosen this hotel had I known. It significantly impacted our stay—what was meant to be a peaceful retreat turned into an unsettling experience. The staff, however, were very friendly and service-oriented, doing everything they could to make our stay as pleasant as possible. But unfortunately, there was nothing they could do to mitigate the noise and disruption. We were given another room so that we wouldn’t have to look out over the torn-up swimming pool, and instead, we had a small garden with beautiful plants, which was much appreciated. Sadly, we didn’t sleep well, as the soundproofing in the rooms was poor—you could clearly hear guests walking and talking in the hallways. The beach loungers were quite worn out, and the beach itself lacked the charm and comfort you would expect, making it feel disconnected from the hotel. Overall, the hotel still lacks attention to detail and feels unfinished. I believe that if there were no ongoing construction and more care was given to the finer details, this could be an exceptional place. However, at the current price point, the stay is simply not worth it. I would strongly recommend calling ahead to check on the status of the construction before making a booking."

Breakfast is excellent, with a wide range of food and beverages from Indonesian, Western, Indian, and Chinese cuisines. The corridor tunnel to the lobby is a must-photo spot.

"159.","Ross Heideman","17","2025-03-03","5","The Meru Sanur: Stylish Design and Warm Balinese Hospitality 5 out of 5 stars My recent stay at The Meru Sanur was a really enjoyable experience. The resort has a great contemporary feel, and the staff were incredibly welcoming and helpful. The design of the Meru is definitely a highlight. It's modern and stylish, with clean lines and a relaxed atmosphere. It felt sophisticated but not overly formal, which was exactly what I was looking for. The resort blends in well with its surroundings, making the most of the natural beauty of Bali. Our room was spacious and comfortable. It was well-designed, with everything we needed for a relaxing stay. It was clean and modern, and there was plenty of room to unwind after a day exploring. The pool area is fantastic. The pool itself is large and inviting, and there are plenty of sun loungers to relax on. The gardens around the pool are well-maintained and create a peaceful environment. The service at The Meru Sanur was excellent. All the staff were friendly and approachable, always happy to help. The daily check-in messages were a nice touch, and it was clear they genuinely cared about making sure we were having a good time. It was also nice that staff remembered our names; it added a personal touch to the experience. Overall, I had a wonderful stay at The Meru Sanur. It's a stylish and comfortable resort with friendly staff and great facilities. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxed and enjoyable holiday in Sanur."

"166.","shahzain mustafa","148","2025-03-31","5","My recent vacation to Bali exposed me to a variety of places that portrayed the charm of the island, and the hotel that, in my opinion, provided the best experience was the Meru Sanur! This resort, which is located in the heart of Sanur beside the gorgeous sea, successfully captures the beauty of nature while offering a relaxing and pleasurable stay. The Meru is well located away from the crowded streets of Bali. I was in utter astonishment when the staff led me to the underground reception room when I initially couldn't find the main building! The abundance of open space in the reception area, despite its underground location, served to alleviate any sense of claustrophobia. After checking in, I was brought to my room, and the walk there was just breathtaking. The architecture of the building, the restaurant's view of the pool and beach, and the sheer amount of nature everywhere I looked astounded me! My admiration for the establishment grew as I walked into my room and saw a much more luxurious and modern setting, as if I had stepped into a five-star hotel rather than a resort. The accommodations featured an open balcony with a sliding door that provided a breathtaking view of the pool and the sea, a wonderful bathroom with all the conveniences, and other complimentary items. I made use of a few of the hotel's numerous services. Everything you could possibly need to stay in shape is available at their gym, and I was even more impressed by the fact that they only use the best equipment. The gym also has a fitness coach on hand to assist you whenever you need it! Their spa was the next establishment I tried, and it used both contemporary and traditional herbal therapy to provide me a relaxing experience that let me release all the tension I had accumulated while traveling. The Meru also provides bicycles for guests who like to ride down the beach and take in the cool sea breeze. The Meru also has a restaurant called Arunika that offers both local and international delicacies. Enjoy delicious food prepared to perfection at Arunika, an outdoor restaurant with a breathtaking view of the sea. This was a nice chance to relax and enjoy the peaceful surroundings after a long day. I had an absolutely amazing experience at The Meru overall. They truly captured my heart and are a must-see location. They provided me with excellent services, delicious cuisine, luxurious lodging, friendly staff, and the opportunity to experience Bali's natural beauty at my doorstep!"

Selanjutnya, kami disuguhi welcome drink yang menarik berupa racikan air jahe dengan infuse bunga talang (butterfly pea), menghasilkan rasa asam segar dan warna indigo yang memikat. Registrasi kami dipandu oleh butler bernama Anggi yang percaya diri dan memiliki product knowledge yang baik. Saat tiba di kamar, kami diberi penjelasan tentang berbagai fasilitas seperti mini bar. Setiap permintaan kami seperti tambahan bantal dan handuk ditanggapi dengan cepat dan tepat oleh tim. Kami kemudian makan di Restoran Arunika yang menghadap langsung ke main pool, dilayani oleh Titin yang sangat baik dan sigap. Nikmat sekali menikmati sore hari dengan kopi atau teh di sini. Saat berkeliling, anak kami melihat sepeda dan dengan senang hati diberikan waktu 2 jam untuk peminjaman gratis. Meski anak kami sempat terjatuh, karyawan bernama Dwi dengan sigap memberikan pertolongan pertama yang sangat profesional, mencerminkan layanan premium dari hotel ini. Malam harinya kami makan di Restoran Roso yang menyajikan makanan Indonesia. Rasa makanan cukup enak dengan pelayanan yang sangat baik oleh Arya.

Everyone is extremely friendly, polite and willing to help 3. Rooms and service: rooms are big and nice. The room service was coming 2-3 times a day 4.

"179.","Vahid Aleheidar","118","2024-12-31","3","Our stay at this hotel was mostly positive, with friendly staff and a quiet, relaxing location. However, we noticed that the service often came with long delays, likely due to short staffing. The team seemed quite confused whenever there was an event at the hotel, which made things a bit chaotic. While the peaceful setting was nice, it’s far from attractions and nightlife, so you’ll need to plan around traffic, which was especially frustrating on our way back to the airport. On a positive note, the new shopping center nearby has added some convenience. We also found that not all of the free hotel facilities were explained to us on the first day, so we were glad we didn’t accidentally pay for anything extra. Overall, it was a decent experience with some room for improvement."

Located on the site of Bali’s first ever luxury hotel in huge a built by the second longest serving president Suharto, the whole site has an energy about it that feels powerful. The hotel Meru is stately, overwhelming at times with massive hallways, towering ceilings, a lot of stone, historical statues and huge spiral staircases and more. A large stately building opens out to a huge expanse of beachfront, with the main restaurant right on the edge. Rooms are all suites and all have a balcony. They are lavish, spacious (my tropical suite was 87 sqm)!! And have separate baths and showers, multiple locations to sit and relax and plush king beds. The spa is exceptional. I had one of the best sound healing treatments ever, as well as tarot card reading and massage. Absolutely fantastic. I managed to feel as if I had escaped into an oasis of tranquil calm. Service is outstanding with energetic, kind well trained butlers and wait staff. Food is excellent-with two key restaurants , one modern Indonesian and one for breakfast, lunch and dinner. And a stately bar that doubles as a library. This really is an extraordinary Hotel and a place to create memories and have a sensational stay. At least 20 instagrammable locations!"

Their activities are enough for us and kids to rejuvenate. If you to go for boat ride in the early morning, you can ask for breakfast to go, the bakery are perfect for the whole day trip and you can feed fish a lil bit during snorkle. We stayed at the Meru longer. My back was injured due to the strong waves then I was on wheelchair and lots of the staffs attended me to pick my breakfast. I must write 5 stars comment to an extraordinary staff to Yudi Arya. I was worried that I broke my bone but he replied politely that his grandpa had that kind of pain but it wasn't broken bone. Normal people would have said you wouldn’t be able to move and cry if it was broken bone! He immediately assist with cold packs, and offered me doctor. Ohyeah, his assistance on us upgrading our room were very satisfying. My attires were hanged properly and toiletries and notes were right where I wanted. We met and chat during breakfast one day, he's able to pronounced difficult Taiwanese names.He recommended green juice for picky eaters to have better digestion.

Ada kolam renang yang bersih, restoran dengan banyak pilihan makanan yang semuanya enak, dan ada gym buat yang nggak mau skip olahraga. Serunya lagi, mereka nyediain sepeda yang bisa disewa buat keliling Pantai Sanur. Asik banget bisa jalan-jalan sambil nikmatin suasana pantai. Pelayanan: Staff-nya ramah dan selalu siap membantu. Mereka juga bikin kita merasa spesial, apalagi pas tahu aku lagi rayain ulang tahun suami. Overall, puas banget nginep di sini. The Meru Sanur cocok buat yang pengen liburan santai dengan fasilitas lengkap dan pelayanan top! ⭐ Rating: 9.5/10"

Nice service from staff, but they close the main dining area/ breakfaat looking at the beachfront and same with main pool was closed. Stayed in the beach area to relax but theres swrvice and security was poor. Any people can access the beach while your lying or relaxing. Location is okay but not exclusive for this type of 5 star rating hotel. But overall still enjoy our stayed both me and my wife. Thank you"

Stunning resort settings photos do not take in the beauty, serenity clean resort. We stayed in Tropical room, with comfortable bed pillows and cold, air-conditioned rooms,with netflix. Spa with Setline was relaxing, soft very peaceful the spa ladies are very friendly and accommodating to your needs Cindy was very professional and friendly. Bicycles are complimentary for 2hrs to enjoy a ride along the beach front 5mins to Icon centre, markets and plenty of restaurants. We booked thru luxury escapes with lunch or dinner included which is same menu which has plenty of choices. Breakfast buffet 6.30am-10.30am is amazing from Asian to western and everything in between.

Dan kami merasakan penyambutan dari amassador hotel Yudi dan team bahkan sampai ke dalam kamar, sungguh pengalaman yg berbeda karena sebagai tamu, kami merasa special. Area kamar juga besar sekali dengan pemandangan taman dan beach, amazing! Makanan dan staf di restoran luar biasa, taman disekitar di hias dengan begitu cantik, arsitek design yg mengagumkan! 4 jempol dari kami!"

The Meru is stunning bechfront hotel with very beautiful design, cozy ambiance, smell wood, huge pool, and well mantain garden. Breakfast is variety and all delicious. We really enjoyed our snack and wine in lounge access in 5pm-7pm. We use bike to explore the area around Meru. That was one of favorite parts. Thank you to Mba Setlin and Mba Rika as Spa therapist, you made us sooo rilex and feel fresh. Overall, we had a wonderful stay at The Meru Sanur and definitely would recommend to anyone.

"211.","arya mahardiawan","100","2025-01-31","4","Salah satu hotel yang merupakan bagian dari kawasan The Sanur, selain Bali Beach Hotel. Service dari hotel ini secara keseluruhan sudah baik. Tetapi masih saja ada diskriminasi terhadap tamu lokal. Ketika saya memilih tempat duduk, napkin yg ada di meja diambil dari meja sedangkan tamu lain (foreigner) napkinnya tetap dibiarkan di meja. Di meja juga tidak disediakan tissue. Selang beberapa lama ketika diminta baru diberikan tissue. Ketika selesai sarapan dan sehabis dari pantai. Saya kembali ke area hotel dan mengambil dokumentasi di dalam kawasan hotel. Tanpa bertanya terlebih dahulu petugas keamanan di pantai langsung menegur dan mengatakan tidak boleh mengambil foto. Semoga diskriminasi semacam ini tidak terjadi lagi."

The lobby is impressive, filled with statues that create a strong Balinese atmosphere. Unfortunately, the food is quite ordinary and not special. If the food could be upgraded and the variety expanded, it would be perfect."
"214.","Raeshad Parandangi","14","2024-12-31","5","TLDR: (+)good price (discounted due to corporate discounts and renovation is ongoing), best gym facility, yoga classes, pool near the beach, ocean view (-)sound from the angle grinder in the middle of the night (just 1 or 2 minutes, nothing major). Kamar: Tidak ada komplain. Botol minum kaca disediakan 4, ada buah, delicious coffee, ada bathrobe, ada smart TV. Kalau mau agak picky, botol minum kaca 4 itu masih kurang sih untuk 2 orang, untungnya saya cuman sendiri jadi aman saja. Sayangnya tidak diberikan akses netflix atau subscription streaming service lainnya (memang jarang hotel yang memberikan ini sih). Dan dari kamar saya masih terlihat tempat renovasi tersebut, sangat kecil dan tidak menggangu sebenarnya. Fasilitas: tidak ada komplain, gymnya sangat lengkap, cuman saya belum sempat menggunakan, hanya sempat lihat dari luar. Kolam renangnya bersih. Lagi-lagi, kalau mau picky, tempat resepsionisnya kenapa disamping gitu, malah tidak terlihat oleh orang yang melihat."

"227.","J T G Nielsen","326","2024-12-31","5","The newest luxury hotel to arrive in Sanur is the beautiful MERU Sanur. Located next to the first international hotel in Bali, the Bali Beach Resort and close to the new international Bali Hospital the MERU is part of the huge medical wellness tourism complex and close to the new shopping centre or Mall. The arrival is excellent as you walk through the almost museum like hallways and admire the amazing architecture and artwork. The arrival to your room is delightfully arranged giving you a great sense of the stunning space! The breakfast is BIG and very nice with everything you could dream of. Dine also for lunch or dinner, but with a hotel located on the beachfront there is heaps of choice along the beach walk. The pool is superb and gym very nice, but it’s all about the stunning rooms and the size and comfort of these suites. Beautifully designed and decorated with local amenities and luxury galore!!! The resort is still only partially open, as a new pool and rooms are being finished off, but overall this is being well managed with only few distractions or limited noises. Once the total resort is completed it could become one of Bali’s best resorts with superb facilities to match the luxury of the new suites!! For lovers of Sanur this is a nice addition…..enjoy!!"
"228.","Emily Davis","2","2024-12-31","5","My partner and I stayed at the Meru for just under two weeks in October. It was incredible. I’m not one to do reviews, but I just had to for this experience, not only for the facilities and destination itself but for the people who made our holiday incredible. All of the staff were incredibly friendly. In particular, there were several who made our stay feel warm and welcoming – Chandra, Gede, Pande, Prema and Christa. Without these wonderful people, I doubt our experience would have been the same. They went above and beyond in their service, and I can only say what a wonderful asset they are to your team. People like them are what turn visitors into repeat visitors. So, thank you, we can overstate how much we appreciate your service. These wonderful people deserve recognition and reward for the leading by example for their employer. A few other mentions for people considering staying. The GM cocktail night, Sunday brunch and daily 5pm food/drinks in the lobby were some of the highlights and benefits on staying in the resort. Things like this always left you with something to look forward to. The food and facilities were incredible, it truly feels like luxury. The Resort was still being completed, so it did lack an area to have an after-dinner drink with a bit of a vibe, but I believe that is coming with the Cigar Longue to open. Also, the Spa was yet to open, which was a little disappointing. Thankfully, we stayed at the Meru and were able to enjoy the private pool, as the main pool always lacked chair availability. However, when the remaining rooms open that may become a similar problem for the resort... Overall, our time at the Meru was incredible, and we cannot wait to come back in the future. Thank you for providing an amazing holiday."

My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at the hotel and have recommended it to all our friends and family. Meru Sanur is a new luxury hotel in Sanur with many amenities such as first class restaurants, a spa, a well-equipped gym and is conveniently located in the heart of Sanur. The rooms are tastefully furnished to a high standard with a luxurious touch, and the food such as the breakfast buffet was lovely We have been to many top hotels in Bali but Meru Sanur is now at the top of our list. The hotel staff were very welcoming and attentive to our needs throughout the duration of our stay and the hotel facilities were of an impeccable standard. Hotel management made us feel like family, which elevated our stay. Thanks to Ed Brea ,Claudio Beretta , Marco Medaglia Ling and Eka for making our last trip a memorable and wonderful one . They are fantastic guys !! Meru Sanur is not just any hotel - it’s an experience that you must visit when in Bali! We will be sure to return here! Tonie & Anna"

Dan yang paling saya suka adalah ramah anak. Keren dan keren. Tapi ada satu kurangnya. Mohon di sediakan kursi yang memadai untuk driver di area parkiran. Kasihan kalau hujan lantai basah."
"237.","Yosua Marulitua Manullang","17","2024-12-31","3","Menginap di The Meru dari tanggal 23/05/2024 - 26/05/2024 (3 malam), pengalaman check in sudah kurang menyenangkan, book 2 kamar ( di 3301 dan 3303 ) namun kamar yang 3301 baru bisa ditempati setelah Pkl 17.30 itupun setelah di call terus ke guest service >5 kali baru diberikan kunci kamarnya, padahal saat check in dijanjikan kamar ready Pkl 15.00 Keesokan hari-nya saat sarapan pagi / breakfast, terdapat pengalaman kurang menyenangkan juga, pesan minuman kopi (ice capuccino 2 gelas, lebih dari 1 jam baru datang, itu pun setelah dibantu staff yang sangat care sekali bernama bli Kadek, staff staff sebelumnya sangat tidak bisa meng-akomodir. Sore hari-nya setelah selesai beraktivitas di luar hotel, saya mendapati kamar belum di make up oleh house keeping, padahaln sebelum keluar kamar pada siang hari-nya sdh kami pesankan ke guset service dan menyalakan tanda make up room di dekat pintu utk notifikasi kamar dibereskan, nyata-nya kamar tidak dibereskan. Setelah di call, kami memutuskan ke area kolam renang utk menunggu kamar dibereskan. Setelah kembali ke kamar, ada peristiwa yang sangat mengganggu, dimana face towel dan hand towel di kamar 3301 tidak ada, dan di kamar 3303 amenities tidak di reffil oleh house keeping. Setelah dihub ke bagian house keeping mengenai towel di 3301, bagian terkait baru bisa memberikan face dan hand towel > 2 jam kemudian dengan alasan towel habis (big question here, kok bisa towel habis) Malam itu kami memutuskan untuk dinner di hotel. Saat sampai di restaurant kami diarahkan duduk di bagian depan resto yang mengarah ke kolam renang di bagian paling kanan, order makanan dan setelah makanan disajikkan tiba-tiba ada seekor anjing (sepertinya stray dogs) yang mendekati meja kami. Saya tidak panik namun untuk sebuah resort bintang 5, sepatutnya stray dogs tidak memasuki area resort apalagi sampai bisa masuk ke area restaurant. Apakah disini tim yang menjaga di area pantai tidak notice ada nya stray dog yang berkeliaran di sekitar resort? Keesokan hari-nya team housekeeping sudah mengetuk kamar di pagi pagi sekitar jam 9 ke jam 10 utk merapikan kamar, kami memutuskan utk sarapan ke coffee shop sekaligus menunggu kamar dibersihkan, saat kembali ke kamar, didapati lagi amenities di kamar 3303 tdk di reffil oleh team house keeping. Begitu pula dengan mini bar, tidak di reffil sejak kemarin hingga hari ini. Siang hari-nya kami memutuskan untuk aktivitas keluar hotel. Memutuskan utk menggunakan buggy yang bisa mengantarkan dari wing c gedung ke lobby. Sdh menghubungi ke guest service, namun setelah sampai di spot jemput buggy, saya sekeluarga menunggu cukup lama, hingga harus menelepon kembali ke nomor telp hotel pstn melalui handphone (karena tdk ada telp umum hotel yg disediakan di sekitar pick up spot) dan pihak guest service sampai terkejut bahwa saya belum di pick up oleh buggy. Malam hari-nya terdapat acara di area pantai, tidak ada pemberitahuan ke kamar bahwa akan ada acara yang diselenggarakan hingga pkl 00.00 wita, karena kedua kamar saya ocean view room, suara dari acara tersebut sangat terdengar bahkan setelah semua jendela teras tertutup rapat dengan gorden. Overall kualitas kamar dari segi interior sangat baik, namun sangat butuh peningkatan kualitas di berbagai aspek. Sangat dinantikan perbaikan dari tim agar tamu lain yang akan stay dapat ter akomodir dengan baik."
"238.","Kristen Ireland","34","2024-12-31","3","I was surprised how poorly designed this brand new hotel is. It's designed for Instagram, not usability or longevity. The entry goes on like the opening credits of Maxwell Smart leading to the open air check-in foyer sweatathon. The nearby underground bar is an absolute sauna and the reason it's always empty. The timber decking surrounding the pool has ramps and drop offs and unless you're really watching you will trip and/or fall - watched a number of guests succumb to this. The pool (Meru, didn't try Beach Hotel pool) is enormous and without shade so is warmer than a bath and not the cooling refresh one hopes for. The room (had corner ocean view... with no view) is again Insta worthy but the bathroom is such a poor design - shower floods so you have to roll and saturate all bath mats to create a barricade between shower and bath otherwise water extends out of bathroom. And that from a rainshower head with 47 of the 121 jets not working. Imagine the damage if it was fully operational. I watched staff destroy a birds nest which clearly left the adult birds distressed. Could they not have just moved it? The team of staff who manage room and property cleanliness and the female team members on the restaurant floor are amazingly helpful. However, the male team members need a great deal of education. I travel solo regularly, this was the only place I've ever felt uncomfortable around male staff. At no point was I asked how my stay was going or went and no survey was shared where I could have shared this information more discreetly. At $1800aud for 3 nights I guess I expected more and was sorely disappointed. Oh, and the kicker is 3 weeks after departure I'm still waiting for The Meru to refund the $300aud checkin deposit."
"239.","Henry Manampiring","58","2024-12-31","2","Not coming back. Family at risk. The service is lacking relative to all the luxury image it projects. The ala carte food portion is not worth the price (nor the taste exceeded expectation to compensate). We asked for extra pillow and blanket and 6 hours later they still did not come. Called the reception and nobody answered. Things got worse. Suddenly a strong gasoline odor inside the room. It hurt the airways We tried to ask for immediate assistance and the response was slow, again. Eventually we had to evac the dangerous room. Turned out there was construction that produced the toxic fume. Very, very hazardous to guests. And we had a little child. On the positive note, Alit the hotel manager was very courteous, attentive, and responsive. He knows what to do in situations like these. We are not coming back again. The bad experience was too much. There are other hotels at similar tier which offer much better service standard."
"240.","Evania Felisa Kristanti","11","2024-12-31","5","Stayed at The Meru for 2 nights. The architecture was top notch, very grandeur. However, please add more wayfinding from the drop off to the lobby so it wont be much confusing for the first-time guests 🙏 Smooth check in and the receptions were very attentive and nice. Rooms were huge, nice bedding. Bathroom was clean and hygiene, equipped with toto neorest. Breakfast was good, lots of variety in indonesian and western cuisine. However, the hotel probably might consider to add variety in other cuisine, as I recalled there were only 3 menus for chinese cuisine and 1 menu for japanese cuisine."

"245.","Brilliant Hermawan","117","2024-12-31","5","Recently opened new hotel in Sanur area. There are actually two hotels in the same site, the easily-spotted Bali Beach Hotel (which is heavily renovated heritage hotel) and The Meru which is more of the luxurious version. Keep in mind that these are two separate hotels, but they do share the same lobby and breakfast/dining area, though I'm not sure if they gonna keep the dining area combined once they fully opened. Yes, they're still in a kind of soft opening stage. I asked the staff and they're scheduled to fully open by September or October if I recall correctly. As of now there's only one building wing that's operational, with another wing still in progress. Well, even in their pre-grand opening stage, this hotel blew me away. The welcoming corridor makes you feel you're being transitioned from the real world to their own tranquil world, then you're welcomed to their welcome lobby which is very spacious and lovely-designed with elements of wood and carvings. The architecture in this hotel is just on another level. Yes, there might be bigger, grander hotel, but there's just something in this hotel that just makes it more calming, prettier and tranquil. It's just beautiful. From the corridor, lobby, to the room corridor, the architecture is something else. It feels like you're experiencing art. The room is also very spacious, comfortable and very well-designed. The touch of wood and warm color really makes a comfortable stay. Oh did I also mention that it was CLEAN? Again, there might be hotels with bigger room but The Meru's room is just so well-put it just makes me feel right at home. The staff are also very friendly and helpful. One even went above and beyond in their service. Once I asked for a buggy ride from the drop-off lobby to our room building since it was quite a walk and my wife is pregnant. The staff who drove us (I forgot to ask for his name, but I hope good things come to your way!) not only drive us to the usual drop point. He even drove us to another route which is closer to our room since he noticed my wife was tired. The staff is just on another level. The Meru also have a direct access to the beach which is a big plus for people that loves to hang out at the beach, though the beach is not private. But this makes a lively beach front with a lot of people passing by running or riding a bicycle along the shoreline to enjoy the beach. Speaking of bicycle, the hotel also offers free bicycle rental for its guests. The breakfast/dining area is also well-designed, very comfortable with open-air design which makes a great breakfast experience where we can just sit and enjoy the meal overlooking the pool and the beachfront. Also, this might be a bit nitpicking, but I guess the service at breakfast could be improved a bit. On separate days during breakfast I noticed that while the staff were quick to welcome you to your seat and ask me for my order, it took somewhat quiet a bit of time for me to get my order, if at all. Though I saw that the breakfast staff do get really busy at times and look understaffed so I don't really mind. This is just a small inconvenience, which make it more understandable since they're officially not a fully functioned hotel, but it does takes away the experience of a great breakfast time. Hopefully the service will improve once they fully opened in Q4. But overall the experience of staying in The Meru is just top-notch. The room, the lobby, the ambience, the architecture, the staff.. they were just magnificent. All of those really makes a really great experience. The Meru should be on your short-list for your next getaway on the island."
"246.","Timmy Tran","58","2024-12-31","4","Great hotel, just a little bit messy during check-in. The details on the paperwork were incorrect, so read carefully when signing.

"257.","anne putri","169","2025-03-03","5","The Meru Sanur, a newly renovated hotel by the Indonesian government, seamlessly blends heritage and luxury with its grand interiors and signature tagline: Tropical Paradise. From the moment you step in, the atmosphere is rich in history and elegance—from the lush greenery, the beautifully preserved Pule tree (which holds deep significance in Balinese mythology), to the expansive lobby that welcomes you into a world of timeless charm. One of the most unique experiences here is the Melukat ritual—a traditional Balinese purification ceremony. Waking up to this sacred ritual, led by a local priest at a nearby pura, was an unforgettable moment of spiritual cleansing and cultural connection. Beyond the hotel, you’ll find a powerful piece of Indonesia’s history—the stone relief by Harijadi, standing since 1965. This monumental work reflects President Soekarno’s vision to promote Bali tourism, yet remains unfinished due to the political shifts of that era. Seeing it in person is truly a privilege, a glimpse into a pivotal moment in Bali’s past. For a perfect culinary experience, Roso Restaurant at The Meru offers delicious Indonesian cuisine with breathtaking beachfront views—the ideal way to soak in Sanur’s beauty. Whether you’re here for the history, the luxury, or the cultural experience, The Meru Sanur is more than just a stay—it’s a journey through Bali’s heritage, spirituality, and elegance. ✨"

"267.","Andre Yongnata","12","2024-12-31","5","Disclaimer : I am giving 5 stars rating just because i know how important rating is and how frustrated when we get 1 stars rating. Stayed here for 2 nights, lower your expectations for $300 per night hotel. No need to tell you the pros, it’s should be your standard anyway. Cons : - Breakfast quality is way below standard for the price we paid for. Sharing location and menu with bali beach hotel which is you can pay for 50% less. It is unfair for The Meru guest, we should have more benefit like ordering ala carte menu or something else. - Coffee is terrible, neither hot and cold. - We don’t even try ala carte menu for dinner just because their breakfast is pretty bad. You know ala carte menu in 5 stars hotel is pretty expensive, we don’t gamble. - Room floor is slippery, using in room sandals even more slippery. VERY DANGEROUS. - Shower pressure could be better, and we got broken shower switch in our room. - Using cool up toothpaste is a joke for $300 per night hotel. - If you are less than 160cm tall, you will hard to reach the wardrobe hanger because it is so high. - Forget to chill and enjoying read a book by the pool, it is very limited seat and only half have umbrella, and again it is sharing pool with bali beach hotel. - Bathroom privacy is very low, people can see you clearly if you are not aware to close all roller blind. - Requesting cutleries or mineral water will take 15-20 minutes, they are very slow like Garry in the spongebob. - Front desk staff should be trained again, being friendly is not enough. - Gojek and Grab Driver park far away from lobby, they need to walk to lobby quite far for delivery your package, please think about them too, we are all in the same industry. Don’t disrespect them. Overall, we prefer go to Andaz rather than The Meru. Otherwise bali beach hotel can be option for half price and same facilities with the meru."

"269.","Artha Doyle","22","2024-12-31","2","Not up to par! I was not made aware that the hotel was still undergoing construction nor that it was sharing its facilities with Bali Beach Hotel (a much larger hotel that sells for 1/3 the price). What they got wrong: - breakfast felt like an all you can eat buffet at a cheap hotel with about 250 people - forget sitting beside the pool reading a book, it’s also crowded. - construction noises still going on in different areas of the hotel. - if you’re hungry after 11pm they only have a limited food selection, one of which is gado-gado?? (Who eats gado-gado after midnight??) Now the rooms. Pros: - beautiful design and very spacious - toilets use the latest Toto automatic technology (best toilet so far our of all the hotels I’ve stayed at) Cons: - exposed fuse box - bathroom was dirty upon arrival - water pressure could definitely be better - bathroom privacy disaster. They use a split blind manual system for the bathroom. Firstly it should be a single piece automated roll down blind. Secondly, it needs to block anyone from the balcony seeing in, which this doesn’t. Summary: I truly felt duped. First time I believe I’ve said that about a hotel I’ve stayed at. Definitely not worth USD400 a night. This resort needs at least another year for management to: 1. Complete construction 2. Figure out that you can’t mix guests and facilities between a luxury resort and a family budget hotel. 3. Fix the food selection for room service 4. Train the front desk staff better In the meantime, go to Andaz or Intercontinental Sanur."

"273.","Katarina Arandjelovic","76","2024-12-31","5","To start with, a few disclosures straight up: 1. The resort shares grounds with Bali Beach Hotel, although eventually there will be an exclusive pool area for resort guests only 2. The resort is still under construction (and the hotel next door under renovation) so there is some mild distant construction noises until approx 4pm, although this did not it impact my enjoyment 3. The resort is still in a soft opening phase, so some fine details remain to be ironed out and spaces finished (e.g. the spa) 4. This resort is geared towards adults, and this is a nice change given the remainder of the Sanur strip is drowning in kids pools / areas / clubs For the inquisitive, a brief history lesson. Bali Beach Hotel next door was built by visionary President Sukarno with Japanese reparations from WW2. It was the first hotel in Bali, an island he saw as a holiday destination long before it came to be what it is today. More recently, the team at Yolodi Maria Architects have undertaken a mammoth project to rejuvenate the ageing hotel, while also creating a beautiful new resort. To that end, they’ve created a masterpiece. Now let’s get to the review - firstly, the lobby is striking and moody, paying homage to Balinese traditions with exquisite timberwork and traditional statues. The play of light and sound transports you. Outside, the grounds are immaculate and the architecture is spectacular. The expansive pool opens out onto the beach side footpath, immediately beyond which is the beach itself. This is the northern(ish) part of sanur, thus quieter to foot traffic, and the beach is more or less exclusively dotted by hotel guests. There is no beach club or restaurant or bar directly next door, creating a perfectly relaxing oasis. The pool itself is gorgeous. There are plenty of sun lounges around it, some I suspect more recently added after earlier reviews - but it shows they are receptive to feedback. There are sun loungers in the shade, in the sun, in the water, facing the pool, facing the beach - you’re spoilt for choice. Want a snack and coconut by the pool? You got that too! Immediately behind the pool is the open dining space. This hosts the generous morning buffet with choices to accomodate all tastes. While it is all outdoors, both in the morning and evening there is a beautiful sea breeze which makes for comfortable dining. You won’t break a sweat. The rooms are spacious and beautifully appointed. The mattress is like a cloud, and the king bed is expansive. The bathtub has a view over the garden. The dressing room is spacious and features a powder table. The materials are luxurious - no cost was spared here. Housekeeping is attentive and offer a second service in the afternoon. The bottled water is complimentary, as are the snacks in the minibar. The television is large, tv subscription is advertisement-free (rare). The aircon is quiet and the balcony glass double glazed - you will sleep like a baby. Perhaps the best part of this hotel is the staff. Everyone is super polite, friendly and attentive. They are proud to work here and so make spectacular hosts. A few suggestions for the ‘ironing out’: - There is a long wait for coffee in the morning, and that is very understandable - it’s busy! A second coffee machine may be a good investment (guest tip, order early!) - A light switch for the minibar would be great, the light pollution is not helpful for us light sleepers (guest tip, consider an eye mask!) - The gym could do with some free weights, that said pumping iron is not most holiday makers’ priority Location wise, the resort is at the start of the 5km paved footpath taking you past a plethora of dining options, and a stone throw from Bali Icon (shopping mall) for all the things you forgot to pack. For those not keen to walk, the resort offers complimentary bike hire, although get in early. Overall I have checked out today and moved onto another hotel (review to come) but in short, I regret it and miss Meru already!"
"274.","Tony Pati","8","2024-12-31","5","I had the pleasure of staying at the Meru Sanur for 10 days with my partner in mid May and cannot speak highly enough of this new Bali sensation. with its suburb location, eloquence and extremely high stands of service. They say first impressions are the most importantly and WOW we absolutely blown away walking down the stairs into the passage way leading to the reception, stunning architecture, amazingly crafted Balinese statues, the sound of running water and the many fountains just set the scene so beautifully..not to mention the beautiful smiling welcome.. this introduction set the scene for a memorable 10 days of superior customer service, relaxation and sensational breakfasts every morning overlooking the beach and sunrise ..What a wonderful way to spend your holiday.. During our long relaxed breakfasts which was faultless in terms of food choices, attention to detail and wonderful smiling welcomes, we had the pleasure of meeting head pasty Chef Juniarta who joined us for a light hearted chat and explained all the various wonderful pastries and specialities made by his staff ..so of course we have to try most of them which were absolutely delicious! We also had drinks, mid afternoon tea and dinner some nights are the restaurant my fave was the lobster bisque but there are many dinner meals to choose from.. The room we stayed in was more than 5 star 🌟. Having travelled around the world and staying in many hotels, I must say this was one of the very best. The hotel isn’t fully opened yet but we will definitely be coming back after the official opening! Thank you Meru and staff, 5 stars 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 to all of you!"
"275.","Glenn Hajadi","13","2024-12-31","3","The Meru is surprising. The design by DAssociates and SHS takes the visitor by surprise with dark massing of the reception lobby. Simple and powerful. The rooms are well designed and spacious. There were still renovation happening and the facilities are still under construction so it dampens the whole experience. Food quality and service still have ways to improve."
"276.","Ehab Ghattas","50","2024-12-31","3","I am writing this review while staying here , with one more night to go, and having spent 3 night already. Like some other reviews said, I feel scammed staying at the Meru. For anywhere from $500-1000 per night, this is a scam! The room and architecture is nice but that’s where it stops. There is no practical inclusions other than breakfast! Just understand this: YOU PAY PREMIUM PRICE BUT SHARE ALL AMENITIES WITH THE NEIGHBOURING BUDGET HOTEL. BREAKFAST: The shared restaurant with the huge budget hotel next door is small and chaotic! Service is way below par!!! All the food run out and take forever to replace! No bread is normal for 5-10 mins. No butter is normal for 15 MINS!!!! even after Asking multiple people for it. For GOD’s Sake I paid $3000 for 4 nights for this place and they didn’t have strawberry jam!!! Oh sorry we run out and made an order!! The head chef comes and tell me we will try to scrap some of the bottom of the jar! This place is charging you premium prices and giving you 3-4 star service at max. My message is: if you don’t have the amenities for a luxury hotel YET, don’t charge luxury price. I stayed at the MULIA Villas for extra $700 in total for 4 night before here and the difference is MINDBLOWING! Mulia has to be 12 stars if Meru is 5 stars. So the excuse of this is soft opening and we share a restaurant and a pool and making it look like it’s a small thing and not much inconvenience is wrong and is a JOKE! You are sharing with a huge hotel. So expect: -No available pool beds and overcrowded pool (defiantly 4 stars standard at max) -extremely overcrowded restaurant with waiting time up to 10-20 mins to get a seat with 3 star service. So in summary: Soft product: service,food etc: 2/5 Hard product: room design , walkways , architecture: 5/5"

Service was exceptional. Every staff was very attentive and welcoming. They all learned my name and always greeted me with a smile. Literally every single staff will greet you when they see you. Food was also delicious. Bli Aris and Mbak Tia, our butlers during the stay, were also amazing! Always making sure that our needs were fulfilled.

By the time I enter the lobby, the foyer is already creating an amazing impression with its grandeur architecture, constant water fountain surrounding the area and impressive statues. I also love the wooden buildings and lush, tropical garden surrounding the rooms. My room is the deluxe type with huge terrace facing the garden, overlooking the ocean afar. the bed is comfortable, with plush pillows and soothing linens. The amenities are complete, mini bar is free (you got coconut chips, dried mango, fresh juice, milk and chocolate), coffee capsules are from Tanamera, and the toileteries are from Sensatia. Love them! The room has corner sofa, working table, flat screen tv and big walking closet, complete with iron, ironing board, big umbrellas, slippers, safety box, mosquito spray and electric, as well as bath salt & loofah. My bath tub is overlooking the garden, with blinds that can be adjusted. Breakfast is just great, with abundant choices of Indonesian, western, oriental (Japanese, Indian, and Asian in general) and more. Fresh juice, fresh coffee (with oat milk) and tea as well as oat milk, chia seed pudding, and more healthy choices. Pools are big. They have one that is shared with Bali Beach Hotel and they have on for the resort pool. The ocean and the beach are also waiting within walking distance. The three beaches, Bangsal; Segara and one more (forgot the name) are walking distance as well. It's close to the port where boats heading to Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Penida are located. Staff are very helpful, including Bli Harta at the front who helped me with my luggage, Chandra at the restaurant, and Tasia who took me to my room without getting lost :). DON'T MISS THE AMAZING SUNRISE HERE! Happy to be back here soon. Highly recommended"

The room design is impeccable, the mixture equisite Balinese traditional design but yet infused with a slight modern touch. The room is so hugh at least 80sqm and we fell in love with the beauty of it. The granite entrace and hallway of the hotel are so big, theatrical and majestic. Making those who come to visit to be in awe by beauty of the hotel. Love every single thing of it and would love to repeat our stay for our next honeymoon.

Hotel berbintang 5 dengan pemandangan matahari terbit di Pantai Sanur ini, juga berubah dari sisi landscape. Sebelum ditata untuk dijadikan Kawasan Ekonomi Khusus (KEK), hotel yang digagas Presiden Pertama Republik Indonesia Soekarno dan dibangun pada tahun 1963 tampak sangat megah dan besar. Namun, seiring dengan selesainya penataan KEK, hotel yang terletak di Jalan Hang Tuah, Sanur Kaja, Denpasar ini terlihat lebih modern dan lebih hijau dengan banyak taman dan tanaman."

Great location to just relax and enjoy the view, you also get a free bicycle to ride a round the beach, free early morning yoga session with the view of ocean and sun rise and the pool is just breath taking!

Gang tembus pantai (iasanya saya parkir di dekat Mak Beng) Saat menuju parkiran saya sopan hargai staff GIBC yg tugas ; bilang hendak ke parkiran menuju pantai. Eh, malah saya diminta uang 5000rupiah. Padahal orang yang sebelumnya masuk tanpa ditanyakan bahkan tdk bayar. Akhirnya Ok saya bayar 5rb. Sampai diparkiran amburadul tdk tertata. Sepulangnya saya melihat banyak yang masuk memang tdk bayar. Bahkan bukan orang balimasuk ya masuk saja. Pertanyaan saya kenapa saya orng lokal bali(asli denpasar yang hendak Banyu Pinaruh) dan staff juga org bali itu meminta uang ke saya. Kalau parkir motor maksimal 2ribu. Jika memang bayar, buat aturan jangan seenaknya minta uang. Karena sy lihat banyk yg masuk tdk bayar makanya sy buat review ini. Kalau semua yg masuk bayar juga ya saya tdk masalah.suksma"

Satu jam berlalu dan mereka masih belum menelepon kembali! Saya tidak akan pernah menginap di sini lagi. Ini sangat keterlaluan! Jika Anda akan membayar untuk menderita, menginaplah di sini!

"543.","Matt Billett","30","2025-06-20","1","Saya sudah menginap di hotel ini sejak tahun 2002—mungkin lebih dari 15 kali. Dalam perjalanan terakhir saya ke Bali minggu ini, saya ingin berjalan-jalan di area hotel untuk melihat apakah saya ingin menginap di sini lagi pada kunjungan berikutnya, karena hotel ini telah direnovasi total dalam dua tahun terakhir sejak kunjungan terakhir saya (alasan saya menginap di tempat lain kali ini). Namun, ketika saya mendekati gerbang dekat Rumah Sakit Sanur, saya langsung dihentikan oleh dua petugas keamanan yang menanyakan di mana saya menginap. Saya menjelaskan bahwa saya menginap di hotel sebelah (Prime Plaza) dan hanya ingin berjalan-jalan untuk melihat hotel pada kunjungan saya berikutnya. Saya segera ditolak dan diberi tahu bahwa hanya tamu yang sedang menginap saja yang diizinkan masuk. Saya belum pernah mengalami hal seperti ini di Bali. Bagaimana mungkin tamu lama bisa melihat properti baru dan menilai apakah mereka ingin menginap di sini lagi di masa mendatang jika mereka bahkan tidak diizinkan masuk? Setelah bertahun-tahun setia, saya sangat kecewa dengan sikap tidak ramah yang tiba-tiba ini. Sayangnya, Anda telah kehilangan pelanggan lama - dan saya tidak akan merekomendasikan hotel ini kepada keluarga besar saya, yang juga sering menginap di sini."
"544.","Milo Petrovic","7","2025-05-20","1","Komunikasi dengan tim reservasi sebelum tiba di WhatsApp sangat buruk dan buruk... butuh waktu lama untuk mendapatkan jawaban dan tidak membantu. Proses check-in juga bukan pengalaman yang menyenangkan, tetapi sejauh ini baik-baik saja. Ketika kami menuju kamar, ada beberapa barang yang rusak (karena perawatan yang buruk). Setelah mengeluh, kami menerima upgrade gratis. Tentu saja itu tindakan yang baik. Namun, bagaimanapun juga, layanan hotelnya sangat buruk. Ada terlalu banyak orang yang tidak memenuhi syarat yang tidak tahu bagaimana memberikan layanan. Mereka semua sangat ramah tetapi mereka tidak memberikan layanan bintang 5... bahkan tidak ada layanan bintang 4, dan dengan membayar begitu banyak uang, setidaknya Anda ingin mengharapkan ini. Ada 3 lift untuk sekitar 300 orang.... jadi bersiaplah untuk waktu tunggu yang lama untuk naik atau turun... Anda merasa orang-orang sangat frustrasi karenanya. Lagipula, itu tidak seperti yang kami harapkan. Daerahnya sangat bagus. Tetapi bangunannya sangat tua, padahal mereka berusaha membuatnya modern... tetapi fasilitas dasarnya kuno."
"545.","赵劲","2","2025-04-20","1","Saya memesan hotel ini setelah melihatnya, katanya baru dibuka pada tahun 2024. Lobi hotelnya megah, persis seperti di foto, tetapi tidak ada yang menyebutkan betapa buruknya kamar-kamarnya. Selain tidak terlalu luas, perabotannya juga sangat kuno. Jamur dan karat ada di mana-mana pada pembalut wanita. Air pancurannya tidak konstan, hanya panas dan dingin selama beberapa detik. Pemandangan dari kamar biasa saja, dan banyak bintik-bintik mati dan debu. Mungkin renovasi hotel ini terutama berfokus pada fasilitas eksterior. Harganya sebanding dengan kamar di bawah 300 yuan di Tiongkok. 🥲🥲🥲"
"546.","JETSKI EXPEDITIONS","8","2025-01-20","1","Hotel ini secara umum bagus dan lebih baik daripada banyak hotel lain di Bali, tetapi ada beberapa hal yang merusak pengalaman keseluruhan. 1. Kami mendapatkan kamar yang bagus dengan pemandangan laut. Kami memutuskan untuk memperpanjang masa inap agar tidak perlu pindah ke kamar lain dan memindahkan barang bawaan, seperti yang telah kami rencanakan sebelumnya. Kami memperpanjang masa inap di resepsionis dan pergi tidur. Kami mengikuti tur ke Nusa Penida pagi itu. Teman-teman kami di kamar sebelah menerima telepon pukul 1 dini hari saat kami sedang tidur dan diberi tahu bahwa kami harus pindah ke kamar lain keesokan harinya. Mereka tidak memberi tahu kami apa pun. Ketika kami kembali dari tur pukul 19.00, kamar kami tidak dibuka. Mereka mengatakan barang bawaan kami telah dipindahkan ke kamar lain. Kami menunggu 20 menit untuk mendapatkan kunci kamar baru, meskipun saat itu sudah pukul 19.00. Ketika kami sampai di kamar, barang bawaan kami hilang, dan mereka menghabiskan satu jam lagi untuk mencarinya. Kami mendapatkan tiga kamar, salah satunya adalah suite presidensial, semuanya dengan pemandangan laut langsung. Kami membayar lebih dari harga untuk malam pertama, tetapi mereka memberi kami tiga kamar yang identik, yang membutuhkan waktu satu jam lagi untuk diselesaikan. 2. Pagi harinya, kami meminta check-out terlambat, tetapi awalnya mereka menolak. Kami harus menghabiskan waktu lama untuk menjelaskan situasi hari sebelumnya dan mengingatnya kembali. Akhirnya, mereka hampir tidak setuju untuk memesan satu kamar lagi. Meskipun kuncinya tidak berfungsi setelah pukul 12 malam, itu membutuhkan waktu yang lama lagi... 3. Kami memesan spa selama tiga jam, mereka mengonfirmasi reservasi, meminta kami untuk memilih pijat, dan kami bilang akan memilihnya sebelum kami tiba, dan mereka bilang tidak apa-apa. Akhirnya, tiga jam sebelum pijat, kami menuliskan pijat yang kami inginkan, dan mereka memberi tahu kami bahwa seluruh waktu sudah dipesan, meskipun sebelumnya kami sudah bilang tidak apa-apa, dan waktu itu akan menjadi milik kami. Hotelnya sendiri tidak buruk, tetapi situasi seperti ini tidak dapat diterima di hotel sekelas ini. Sarapannya juga tidak terlalu enak; sama sekali tidak ada nuansa Eropanya."

Kami telah menjadwalkan janji temu di spa, hanya untuk mengetahui bahwa spa itu dipasang di kamar standar. Setibanya di sana, tidak ada anggota staf yang hadir, hanya ada satu orang yang duduk di ruang tamu. Kami dibiarkan menunggu di sofa, yang menciptakan suasana tidak nyaman dan tidak profesional. Beberapa hari kemudian, ketika saya bertanya tentang melaporkan pengalaman saya, saya disarankan untuk meninggalkan ulasan di Google. Secara keseluruhan, pengalaman tersebut jauh dari standar layanan dasar dan keramahtamahan."

Saya sedang bersepeda menyusuri jalur Pantai Sanur dan ingin melihat-lihat hotel beserta fasilitasnya, dan mungkin akan pindah ke sini jika saya suka. Penjaganya hampir tidak bisa berbahasa Inggris dan bertanya apakah saya menginap di sini—saya bilang tidak, dan saya sedang melihat-lihat tempat ini. Tidak yakin apa yang dia pahami, dia membiarkan saya lewat dan setelah saya berjalan sekitar 200 meter, dia mengejar saya dan mengarahkan saya ke pintu keluar pantai. Walkie-talkie-nya berderak dan saya yakin dia mengikuti arahan orang lain. Saya hanya berada di area hotel, bahkan tidak di dalam. Praktik bisnis yang bodoh. Di tempat asal saya, hotel-hotel seperti itu mengundang orang untuk tur—mereka berdalih, Hei, Anda mungkin tidak cocok menjadi tamu kami; besok Anda mungkin."

Ada beberapa masalah dengan AC bocor, pipa ledeng & brankas kamar tidak berfungsi, tetapi semuanya segera diperbaiki. Kolam renangnya bagus. Pernah ada insiden dengan petugas kebersihan kamar, memergokinya mencuri barang-barang yang baru dibeli dari kamar kami yang masih ada di dalam tas belanja rip curl (peralatan selancar). Petugas kebersihan awalnya bilang barang-barang itu ada di tempat sampah kamar... ternyata tidak. Kami menelepon manajemen dan mereka bilang dia memasukkan barang-barang kami ke lost and found... padahal barang-barang itu ada di kamar kami! Setelah diskusi dengan petugas kebersihan dan manajer jaga, petugas kebersihan mengakui bahwa barang-barang itu tidak ada di tempat sampah kami. Manajemen hotel tidak terlalu peduli dan kami meminta untuk check out tetapi pengembalian dana ditolak, karena kami belum pernah mengalami masalah seperti ini di hotel lain selama 30 tahun bepergian ke Bali. Mereka bilang...hubungi Expedia. Pertama dan terakhir menginap di sini."

"556.","Dave","14","2020-01-20","1","Serius, LOL - tempat ini digambarkan sederhana. Itu satu kata untuk menggambarkannya, tapi bukan kata yang akan saya gunakan jika saya sedang berbicara dengan keluarga atau teman. Saya akan bilang hotel/resor/kompleks berusia 40 tahun ini TUA, menyedihkan, kumuh, harganya terlalu mahal, tidak sepadan dengan harganya, dan bisa dihindari. Semua barang di lorong dan kamar sudah tua dan berantakan. Semua furniturnya tua, tergores, dan penyok. Semua kabel dan kontrol lampu serta AC berasal dari abad lalu. Sulit dipercaya mereka mematok harga $190 per hari untuk tempat yang dikelola dengan buruk ini. Dengan harga segitu, Anda mungkin mengira semuanya modern, baru, dan berfungsi sempurna. Lihat saja Menu Layanan Kamar - seharusnya diganti dengan yang baru - bukan yang lama dengan coretan anak-anak. Kamar pertama kami tidak punya kulkas. Ada TV dengan bayangan konstan di tengahnya dan dudukannya disekrup ke lemari. Kamar mandinya punya penyangga untuk lansia yang terbuat dari pipa ledeng bekas. Nat ubinnya menjijikkan dan hitam/kotor. Lapisan sealant putih di sekitar perlengkapan kamar mandi sekarang berjamur dan hitam. Kamar kedua kami lebih baik, tetapi tidak ada brankasnya, meskipun brankasnya sudah diantar setelah dipesan. Saya yakin kamarnya indah dan lebih canggih daripada tempat lain di pulau ini, tapi itu 40 tahun yang lalu. Kami benar-benar kecewa :-( Kami pasti tidak akan merekomendasikan akomodasi ini kepada siapa pun."

Akhirnya, kami menginap semalam karena ada penalti, tetapi kami membatalkan sisa hari menginap. Sungguh sayang untuk dilewatkan."
"560.","Ra Dar (Ra)","40","2021-01-20","1","Ini adalah hotel yang sangat, sangat, sangat tua. Saya tidak tahu berapa usianya, tetapi jelas sudah tua. Saya bisa tahu dari eksterior dan interior bangunannya. Saya menginap di sini selama dua malam, dan ada begitu banyak hal yang salah dengan hotel dan staf ini. Izinkan saya menceritakan bagaimana pengalaman saya (jika Anda mulai membaca, Anda harus menyelesaikannya) 👇 1. Sejak awal, kami masuk ke lobi. Kami disambut dengan ramah oleh seorang wanita. Kemudian dia mengatakan resepsionis berada di lantai 2. Kami naik ke atas. Hanya ada satu orang, yang sedang membantu pelanggan lain (seorang pria). Saya menunggu beberapa menit. Kemudian wanita yang menyambut kami datang ke lantai 2 dengan pelanggan lain dan dia sedang membantu pelanggan lain yang sedang check-in! Astaga. Kami bertemu di lantai bawah dan dia mengabaikan saya begitu saja?? Saya langsung mengeluh. Dia membela diri dengan mengatakan dia mengira saya anggota keluarga dari pria yang sedang check-in. Ayolah, hentikan ASUMSI Anda, staf hotel. Anda bisa bertanya daripada membuat asumsi bodoh di kepala Anda. 2. Kemudian kami masuk ke kamar kami. Lantainya berkarpet. Kalian tahu kan betapa kotornya karpet. Saat itu juga, aku bisa merasakan kotoran di kakiku begitu masuk. Selain itu, karpet di luar kamar mandi basah! Meja TV penuh debu! (Lihat gambar). Aku langsung menelepon layanan kamar. Setelah beberapa menit, tidak ada yang datang. Aku menelepon lagi, aku menunggu. Aku menelepon lagi. Aduh, aku menyerah. Kami pergi keluar hotel untuk makan malam. 3. Setelah kami kembali malam itu, kami menelepon layanan kamar lagi, dan syukurlah, seseorang benar-benar datang dan membersihkannya. 4. Pagi pertama, kami turun ke bawah cukup pagi untuk sarapan (sebenarnya orang pertama yang datang ke restoran). Kamar kami tidak tercantum dalam daftar sarapan!!!! Astaga! Aku sudah membayar untuk dua malam termasuk sarapan. Staf meminta voucher sarapan dan resepsionis tidak memberikannya saat check-in. Aku menyuruh staf untuk menelepon resepsionis untuk mengecek ulang. Jadi dia melakukannya. Sementara ibuku naik ke kamar dan mencoba mencari voucher sarapan. Beberapa menit kemudian, ibu saya kembali (tanpa voucher), dan ada sekelompok orang (6-7 orang, mungkin sebuah keluarga dengan anak-anak) juga berjalan ke restoran. Staf lain (yang berbeda) menyapa kami semua. Dan lagi-lagi staf ini MENGASUMSIKAN bahwa kami semua bersama dan berkata dua kamar untuk keluarga Anda. Saya tidak ingin membuat keributan, tetapi asumsi itu bodoh. Mengapa Anda berasumsi alih-alih bertanya???? Lalu saya meninggikan suara dan berkata Tidak, kami tidak bersama orang-orang itu. Kami dari kamar 703. Bisakah kami sarapan sekarang? Betapa menjengkelkan dan betapa bodohnya! Hotel ini tidak penuh dan staf bahkan tidak dapat menangani beberapa pemesanan/pelanggan. Saya kira staf mengingat saya saat itu, dan sebelum saya meninggalkan restoran, saya berkata dengan lantang dan jelas kami di sini untuk dua malam, dan kami akan kembali besok pagi 5. Saya pergi seharian penuh ke Nusa Lembongan. Saya percaya satu-satunya hal baik tentang hotel ini adalah lokasinya. Lokasinya sangat dekat dengan Pelabuhan Sanur (akses fastboat ke Nusa Lembongan/Ceningan/Penida) sehingga saya bisa berjalan kaki ke sana. 6. Hal lain yang perlu saya soroti adalah pancuran mereka (lihat gambar) yang bukan pancuran sungguhan. Apakah saya kurang beruntung mendapatkan kamar dengan pancuran kecil? Atau semua kamar memiliki pancuran seperti ini? Saya tidak tahu. Tapi ini adalah hotel pertama yang saya temukan di Bali dengan pancuran seperti ini. Sulit untuk mandi dengan pancuran seperti itu, bayangkan saja. 7. Pagi kedua, kami kembali untuk sarapan. Wow, luar biasa, mereka mengingat kami, dan kamar kami ada dalam daftar. Mereka menyajikan sarapan yang agak berbeda pagi itu dibandingkan pagi sebelumnya. Makanan lebih terbatas dan saya tidak bisa mendapatkan jus jambu dan buah sekaligus (saya hanya bisa memilih satu). Oke, saya rasa bisa dimengerti, hotel sedang memangkas anggaran, jadi wajar saja. Secara keseluruhan, Anda bisa mendapatkan penawaran yang lebih baik di tempat lain. Tempat ini tidak direkomendasikan. Saya tidak akan pernah kembali ke sini lagi. Semoga Anda bisa belajar dari pengalaman saya. Terima kasih telah membaca."
"561.","Rip Jacker","1","2019-01-20","1","Foto-foto yang indah itu menipu; hotel ini sangat membutuhkan renovasi. Sekilas, hotel ini terlihat sangat bagus karena halamannya yang hijau dan indah. Kami menginap di salah satu pondok, bukan di gedung utama. Pondok-pondok itu kotor, semuanya perlu direnovasi, tirai shower sangat kotor, dan handuk, yang seharusnya bersih, ternyata kotor dan bau. Seprai juga kotor. Tidak ada pengering rambut di kamar mandi, tetapi kamar lain memilikinya. Kami pindah kamar setelah malam pertama karena kami tidak bisa menyalakan atau mematikan AC. Keran air sudah berwarna hijau dan hitam. Air bocor dari belakang kloset, dan kulkas berjamur hitam di bagian segelnya. Nyamuk dan cicak masuk setiap hari; tampaknya ada kebocoran di suatu tempat. Makanan di dua restoran di pantai tidak konsisten. Saya tidak akan merekomendasikan memesan brownies di sana; rasanya sangat basi, dan saya tidak bisa memakannya. Harganya juga sangat mahal. Empat sendok es krim (ukurannya sama seperti di Jerman) harganya 100.000 IDR, atau sekitar €6. Tidak ada yang datang untuk mengambil pesanan di kolam renang atau di pantai; Anda harus pergi ke kafe pantai sendiri dan memesan, lalu mereka akan mengantarkannya ke kursi berjemur Anda. Pantai selalu kotor; pasang surut air laut membawa sampah dan plastik, dan ada juga banyak sampah di sekitar beberapa pagar tanaman. Sarapan lumayan. Jika Anda datang terlambat, semuanya sangat hangat, karena sarapan dimulai pukul 7:30 dan berlangsung hingga pukul 10:30. Sepertinya tidak ada yang peduli bahwa muesli, sosis, keju, mentega, dan susu dibiarkan di bawah terik matahari selama tiga jam. Karena kami biasanya tidak sarapan sampai sekitar pukul 10:00, omelet adalah satu-satunya pilihan bagi kami. Prasmanan sarapan juga menawarkan makanan panas, tetapi hanya hidangan panas Asia, yang tidak pernah kami sukai. Sekitar pukul 6:00 pagi, Anda sudah bisa mendengar staf menyapu di mana-mana. Kami terbangun setiap hari karena sangat berisik. Di pantai, pemandangannya seperti biasa: semua orang terus-menerus mendekati kami menanyakan apakah kami ingin pijat, jet ski, berbagai wisata, dll. Setelah malam pertama, kami ingin pindah kamar dan mengatakan kami tidak senang dengan kamar kami. Seorang karyawan menunjukkan kepada kami sebuah kamar tepat di tepi laut, tetapi saya rasa awalnya dia meminta tambahan €400 untuk 12 malam. Ketika kami mengatakan itu terlalu mahal, dia menurunkannya menjadi €270. Fasilitasnya persis sama, jadi tidak ada gunanya memesan pondok yang lebih mahal di tepi laut. Beberapa karyawan sangat membantu, tetapi sebagian besar hanya melamun daripada bekerja. Hanya ada air dingin di kamar mandi sepanjang waktu."

"563.","Rui Xavier","7","2019-01-20","1","Pengalaman menginap di hotel terburuk sepanjang perjalanan kami!!!! Tidak seperti yang ditampilkan di situs web, kamarnya sangat buruk dengan toilet yang perlu disiram 6 kali atau lebih, keran yang perlu dioperasikan oleh tukang ledeng terampil dan bocor, AC tidak mencapai suhu ruangan ideal karena kontrolnya tidak berfungsi dengan benar, lampu bohlam yang bocor di kamar dan di seluruh hotel, 2 colokan listrik di kamar digunakan untuk TV dan ketel - tidak ada yang lain yang tersedia. Tata graha kurang detail dalam hal kebersihan. Hotel ini sangat membutuhkan renovasi besar-besaran. Sarapan sudah termasuk, tetapi sebagian besar pilihan yang tersedia kurang memadai dan habis sebelum sebagian besar tamu menyelesaikan sarapan mereka (pukul 8:30). Staf lebih peduli mencatat kedatangan tamu saat sarapan daripada memastikan pilihan makanan tersedia selama sarapan. Ketika masalah ini dibahas dengan staf yang bertanggung jawab, tanggapannya hanyalah permintaan maaf yang tidak tulus dan hanya mengangkat bahu. Tidak ada tindakan untuk memperbaiki wadah kosong. Tidak ada perhatian sama sekali dari tamu. Hal sederhana seperti ketersediaan handuk kolam renang untuk tamu adalah sebuah keberuntungan. Ketika ditanya, jawabannya adalah maaf, sudah selesai. Bahkan tidak ada upaya untuk mencari alternatif lain. Kebanyakan staf tidak ramah dan menghindari tamu, resepsionis tidak mau memberikan nomor telepon layanan taksi lokal dan bersikeras kami menggunakan layanan mereka. Biaya yang mereka eksploitasi untuk layanan yang sama adalah Rp250.000, sementara taksi lokal mengenakan biaya Rp110.000! Sangat mengganggu masa inap kami. TIDAK AKAN PERNAH memesan hotel grup Inna lagi, tidak akan merekomendasikannya kepada siapa pun yang saya kenal, dan menyarankan mereka untuk mencari pilihan lain yang setidaknya memberikan nilai terbaik untuk uang dan perhatian kepada tamu."

Kami menginap di hotel ini selama seminggu dan selama itu kami berhasil pindah lima kamar. Awalnya, kami mengambil kamar termurah dan di sana kami diserang kecoak, lalu mereka pindah, dan itu tidak membantu. Kami membayar tambahan 2 juta rupee dan pindah ke gedung utama. Di kamar pertama, baunya sangat menyengat, seperti jamur, dan di kamar kedua, kecoak lagi. Setelah menyeret kecoak ke resepsionis, kami mendapatkan kamar mewah yang lebih baik.

"567.","Alexander den Engelsman","188","2018-01-20","1","SANGAT MARAH DAN DIHINA SAAT CHECK-IN! HOTEL INI TIDAK PERCAYA PADA TAMUNYA! Tiba hari ini. Berwisata di Indonesia sangat melelahkan. Saya memesan melalui booking.com. Ketika kami tiba di resepsionis resor (kami menginap di bungalow deluxe), mereka meminta semua pembayaran di muka. Kami merasa ini sangat aneh, karena kami jarang melakukan itu. Kami datang ke Indonesia setiap tahun (tahun ke-13) dan sering menginap di hotel bintang 4-5. Lagipula, kami tidak memiliki kartu kredit (pada prinsipnya), dan kami mengerti bahwa kami harus membayar semuanya sekaligus. Sementara itu, salinan paspor saya sudah dibuat dan informasinya telah diperiksa di komputer melalui booking.com. Kami memiliki 1 juta rupiah dan bertanya apakah kami bisa membayarnya. Kami juga bertanya apakah kami bisa membayar sisanya segera setelah check-in ke kamar kami. Manajer sudah datang saat itu, dan ini tidak memungkinkan. Apa pun yang mereka katakan, itu adalah kebijakan. Ketika saya memberi tahu mereka bahwa saya akan mendapatkan ulasan buruk, saya malah mendapat acungan jempol dan jawaban sarkastik baiklah, baiklah. Saya belum pernah merasa begitu dihina di hotel yang seharusnya bagus. Dan kemudian kami memesan untuk tiga orang, tiba di kamar dengan dua tempat tidur single. Dan kami harus membayar ekstra untuk tempat tidur ketiga! Saya tidak akan membuat Anda bosan dengan sisanya, tetapi seperti yang akan saya katakan kepada teman dan kolega saya, HINDARI HOTEL INI. Cari hotel yang lebih bagus dan ramah. Lokasinya bagus (pantai), tetapi ada hotel yang lebih bagus! Jika saya bisa memberi 0 bintang, saya akan melakukannya, tetapi sayangnya, itu tidak mungkin. Pepatah suka tuan rumah, maka dia mempercayai tamunya tampaknya berlaku di sini! BELUM PERNAH SANGAT MARAH DAN DIHINA SELAMA CHECK-IN! HOTEL INI TIDAK MEMPERCAYAI TAMUNYA! Saya memesan hotel ini melalui booking.com dan belum pernah merasa begitu dihina dan marah saat tiba. Kami tiba bersama seluruh keluarga (2 dewasa dan 2 anak) dan sangat lelah. Pertama-tama, kami mendengar bahwa kami harus membayar semuanya di muka jika membayar tunai. (Saya tidak memiliki kartu kredit). Saat itu kami memiliki 1.000.000 rupiah dan kami bertanya apakah kami bisa membayar sebanyak itu. Mereka sudah mendapatkan data pribadi saya melalui booking.com dan mereka membuat salinan paspor saya. Saya bertanya apakah saya bisa masuk ke kamar terlebih dahulu dan kemudian istri saya bisa mengambil sisa uang di ATM. Ini SAMA SEKALI TIDAK MUNGKIN. Kami selalu menginap di hotel bintang 4-5 saat di Indonesia (ini adalah kunjungan ke-13 saya ke Indonesia) tetapi belum pernah mengalami hal seperti ini sebelumnya. Rupanya hotel ini tidak mempercayai tamunya. Dan rupanya hotel ini tidak peduli dengan tamu dan anak-anak mereka. Manajer berkata ini kebijakan, saya tidak bisa melakukannya dan ketika saya mengatakan akan mengadu ke manajemen, dia hanya mengacungkan jempol dan tersenyum. Belum pernah saya DIHINA oleh manajer hotel seperti ini! Saya juga memesan untuk 3 tamu dan kami hanya mendapatkan dua tempat tidur untuk satu orang di kamar kami. Dan kami harus membayar lebih untuk mendapatkan tempat tidur tambahan. Selain itu, air panas dan dingin tidak berfungsi dengan baik. Saya memiliki banyak kolega dan teman yang mengunjungi Indonesia, tetapi saya akan merekomendasikan mereka untuk MENGHINDARI hotel ini! Lain kali kami akan memesan hotel yang MEMPERCAYAI tamu mereka dan lebih ramah serta bersedia bekerja sama. Saya tidak bisa memberikan 0 bintang, jika bisa, saya akan memberikannya!"

Kami memutuskan untuk menelepon resepsionis, dan tanggapan mereka, secara harfiah, APA YANG ANDA INGIN SAYA LAKUKAN? Jadi, kami memutuskan untuk pergi ke resepsionis untuk meminta kamar lain, dan foto-foto yang saya unggah adalah kamar kedua yang mereka berikan kepada kami. Foto-foto itu berbicara sendiri. Saya sama sekali tidak merekomendasikan hotel ini. Mereka juga meminta uang jaminan sebesar 500.000 rupee, yang saya tidak mengerti alasannya, karena kamar-kamarnya berantakan dengan sendirinya tanpa perlu usaha dari tamu.

Temanya: Leading the Way to Sustainable Tourism, lantas sustainability policy nya apa ya untuk nge lead, biar nggak kejeglos? Dapat pelajaran baru ; the difference between Sustainable Tourism, Ecotourism, and Responsible Travel Ecotourism is a niche segment of tourism in natural areas. Sustainable Tourism does not refer to a specific type of tourism, rather it is an aspiration for the impacts of all forms of tourism to be sustainable for generations to come. Responsible Travel is a term referring to the behavior and style of individual travelers. The behaviors align with making a positive impact to the destination rather than negative ones. Begitu cerita. Bagaimana menurut Anda?"

Bagi mereka, bersih-bersih hanya berarti merapikan tempat tidur dan mengisi ulang air dan handuk. Karpet dan bantal berbau kain lap, dan AC berbau seperti belum dibersihkan. Noda air dan jamur sering terjadi di kamar mandi. Mohon lakukan perawatan di kamar. Kamar-kamarnya sangat kotor sehingga saya sangat tidak nyaman menginap di sana."
"691.","Марина Ермакович","42","2025-01-20","2","Saya datang untuk menghabiskan satu malam menikmati ketenangan dan laut. Tapi saya punya acara di bawah balkon saya sepanjang malam dengan musik Indonesia yang keras dan konser. Suasananya sangat mengganggu, bahkan saya sudah menutup jendela dan tirai, dan semuanya terasa seperti pesta. Saya pikir acara seperti ini tidak cocok untuk area hotel atau seharusnya jauh dari kamar."
"692.","shweta mishra","29","2019-01-20","2","Lokasinya sangat bagus, namun kamarnya kurang memuaskan. Kamar mandinya perlu renovasi besar-besaran. Ada banyak sekali serangga, termasuk kadal, di dalam kamar. Dekorasi kamar bergaya lama, yang sebenarnya tidak masalah, tetapi area ganti pakaian perlu direnovasi. Lemari pakaiannya banyak yang retak. Air panas di kamar mandi kurang bagus dan secara keseluruhan pencahayaan di kamar sangat redup. Jangan tertipu oleh tampilan mewah properti ini. Saya menginap di sini selama 3 hari. Di lounge, ada beberapa wanita yang terlalu berisik dengan musik, dan tidak peduli jika mereka mengganggu orang lain. Minuman selamat datang harus diambil sendiri. Jadi, saya tidak mengerti konsep mengambil minuman selamat datang sendiri. Setidaknya mereka bisa menyediakannya di kamar, jika tidak di resepsionis. Saya pernah menginap selama 15 hari di Bali, dan minuman selamat datang yang ditawarkan adalah kebiasaan, bukan diambil sendiri. Dua bintang hanya untuk pemandangan laut dan lokasi hotel."
"693.","Anne-Marie Viljoen","112","2019-01-20","2","Ketika kami memesan berdasarkan foto-foto yang indah dan melihat kamarnya, kami terkejut! Toiletnya harus disiram 6 kali, hanya 1 colokan yang berfungsi untuk TV, ketel, pengering rambut, dan ponsel yang terisi penuh. AC-nya berisik seperti skuter! Handuknya sudah tua. Saya menuntut uang saya kembali atau meminta kamar lain. Lalu saya senang. Tamannya indah, stafnya ramah. JANGAN PERNAH memesan berdasarkan foto, itu menipu!!☹️"
"694.","iwona kupiec","2","2020-01-20","2","Ini sama sekali bukan tempat yang bagus untuk turis. Hari kedua berturut-turut musiknya terlalu keras karena ada acara di sini, tetapi masalahnya adalah lampu yang melewati jendela kami, jadi kami harus menutup balkon sepanjang waktu. Saya penderita epilepsi, jadi ini dapat dengan mudah membahayakan kesehatan saya. Musik disebutkan, tetapi tidak ada hal-hal seperti itu. Setiap hari ada beberapa acara, jadi Anda tidak merasa nyaman sebagai turis. Jika Anda melakukan banyak kegiatan dan membutuhkan tempat yang tenang, jangan menginap di hotel ini. Bukan untuk turis, tetapi hanya untuk acara domestik. Mungkin harganya murah, tetapi tidak berarti Anda harus berada dalam risiko kesehatan. Manajemen yang sangat tidak bertanggung jawab."
"695.","Sasi Emőke","119","2019-01-20","2","Ini hotel retro. Belum direnovasi karena usianya yang sudah tua. Kamar-kamarnya usang, tetapi kamar mandinya besar dan nyaman, berantakan, air panas tidak berfungsi, toilet tidak berfungsi. Kamarnya bersih, tetapi tetap saja tidak memberi kesan bersih. Saya tidak akan kembali sampai mereka merenovasinya. Pasti dulu resornya bagus. Sekarang terlalu ketinggalan zaman dan jelek. Makanannya berantakan, bahkan untuk sarapan kami berjalan ke restoran terdekat. Makanan yang mereka sediakan gratis untuk kamar adalah campuran hidangan internasional dan lokal. Keduanya tidak terasa enak. Meskipun penampilannya buruk, hotel ini cukup penuh, banyak keluarga dan anak-anak berlarian. Jika Anda ingin bersantai, ini jelas bukan tempat menginap yang tepat untuk Anda."
"696.","Muhammad Rezaul Karim Reza","112","2021-01-20","2","Pertama kali saya mengunjungi hotel ini. Hotel yang sangat tua dengan lahan yang luas. Banyak keindahan alam di sekitar hotel ini dengan fasilitas-fasilitas kuno. Jika mereka merenovasinya sesegera mungkin, hotel ini akan menjadi salah satu properti terbaik di Bali. Di dalam kamar, Anda akan mencium aroma kuno, saya langsung berpikir untuk meninggalkan hotel ini setelah check-in. Ukuran kamarnya lumayan. Semua tempat tidur dengan pemandangan laut juga luas, tetapi fasilitas-fasilitas kuno membuat saya tidak senang. Saya hanya menginap satu malam dan itu sudah cukup bagi saya. Sarapannya biasa saja. Pemandangan laut dari balkon kamar sangat mengesankan."
"697.","Rose Hicks","2","2020-01-20","2","Lobi motel itu indah, stafnya sangat ramah dan menyenangkan. Sayangnya, di situlah kami berhenti, butuh waktu lama untuk memesan dalam 1,5 jam. Ketika kami sampai di kamar, yang tercium hanyalah jamur, bau yang sama di bantal, kamar mandi, dan karpet. AC-nya sangat buruk dan suhunya tidak berfungsi dengan baik. Di sekitar wastafel kamar mandi berjamur dan ada rambut di sumbat wastafel. Jadi, satu malam kami menginap di sana, dari enam kamar, terlalu lama, tidak bisa tidur, dan saya batuk karena asma saya. Tidak ada penyesalan dari manajemen. Jadi, kami ber-12 orang pindah ke motel lain yang berbintang 3 setengah. Saya pernah menginap di motel yang lebih baik yang hanya berbintang 3 setengah di Bali. Tidak akan merekomendasikannya kepada keluarga atau teman saya. Nomor ID pemesanan 359249241."
"698.","Tchimi Che","39","2018-01-20","2","Mengecewakan... Mengecewakan. Hati-hati karena hotel, taman, dan pondoknya bersebelahan. Kami tidak tahu dan memesan pondok (bergaya motel). Kami meminta untuk dipindahkan ke hotel dan mereka memindahkan kami tanpa masalah besar. Ini bukan hotel bintang 5. Tempatnya juga terpencil. Makanannya lumayan. Harga restorannya wajar."
"699.","Vladimir Karasev (OwlBob)","44","2018-01-20","2","Ini hotel yang sangat tua, dulunya merupakan contoh kemewahan yang gemilang, tetapi kini sudah mendekati akhir hayatnya. Perabotannya sudah usang, karpetnya kotor, dan banyak serangga (kecoak, semut, dan laba-laba). Renovasi besar-besaran memang sudah lama tertunda, tetapi pemiliknya tampaknya enggan berinvestasi. Selebihnya, semuanya baik-baik saja: halamannya luas dan terawat baik, makanannya enak, stafnya ramah, tetapi saya pasti tidak akan kembali ke sini lagi dan saya tidak akan merekomendasikannya kepada siapa pun."
"700.","Rachel Ash","68","2021-01-20","2","Kami memiliki 3 kamar di lantai 6, semua kamar mandi tua yang perlu ditingkatkan. Semua kamar sedikit pengap tetapi 1 ekstra bau. 2 pintu ke balkon berkarat dan sulit dibuka/ditutup. Tempat tidurnya nyaman. Hanya diganti setiap dua hari sekali. Kolam renang buka sampai jam 7 tetapi hanya menerima handuk sampai jam 6 sore. Ada restoran makanan laut di dekat kolam renang dan mereka membawa makanan kami ke tepi kolam renang tetapi sepertinya itu bukan kolam renang yang dilayani dalam perspektif makanan/minuman. Mereka punya burger dan kentang goreng sekitar $8 dengan pajak menurut saya. 2 seluncuran kecil ke kolam renang anak-anak tetapi sangat kecil sebenarnya, cukup untuk 4-5 tahun. Harga secara umum, spa dan makanan lebih dari yang diharapkan untuk dibayar di Bali. Toko kecil mahal. Nilai tukar uang lebih rendah daripada di jalan. Minuman di bar lebih mahal daripada di jalan. Sarapan prasmanan lumayan tetapi tidak ada yang wow. Kami pikir staf tidak ramah seperti tempat lain yang pernah kami kunjungi. Secara keseluruhan kami tidak terkesan dengan fasilitas dan tidak akan merekomendasikan ini sebagai tempat menginap. Kami tinggal di sini karena dekat dengan perahu ke Lembongan."
"701.","Stephen Cutting","98","2020-01-20","2","Lokasinya bagus, kamarnya agak usang, dan kamar mandinya sangat menjijikkan. Pantai di sebelah hotel memiliki bebatuan tajam di air yang menyulitkan akses ke laut. Garis pasang surut dipenuhi puing-puing. Kolam renangnya lumayan, tetapi kasurnya agak lusuh. Menu sarapannya sebagian besar masakan Indonesia."
"702.","V S","35","2019-01-20","2","Ini adalah kompleks hotel besar dengan taman yang luas dan indah serta tiga kolam renang yang cantik. Bungalow-bungalownya cukup imut. Kamar-kamarnya besar dan bersih tetapi agak kuno. AC berfungsi, tetapi sangat dingin dan tidak dapat diatur. Pantai-pantai berada di dekatnya (beberapa menit berjalan kaki). Sarapan: banyak pilihan. Hidangan khas dan Eropa, tetapi rasanya tidak selalu enak. Stafnya ramah dan membantu, kecuali jika menyangkut pemesanan taksi... Memang, seperti semua hotel, hotel ini memiliki layanan antar-jemput. Namun, harganya 200.000 rupiah untuk ke bandara, dan mereka sama sekali menolak untuk memesankan taksi sungguhan seperti perusahaan Bluebird, misalnya. Anda harus berjalan sedikit ke jalan yang ramai yang tegak lurus dengan hotel, menghindari karyawan yang akan mencoba membantu Anda dengan memesankan taksi (taksi mereka, tentu saja...). Sekadar informasi, taksi biasa dengan argo harganya setengah dari harga taksi dari hotel... Ini sangat mengecewakan mengingat hotel ini disebut-sebut sebagai hotel mewah di Bali. Selama kami menginap, tidak ada hotel lain yang jauh lebih sederhana dan menawan yang menolak mengizinkan kami memesan taksi resmi. Bukannya kami meminta Grab..."
"703.","Paigge Gilbert","10","2019-01-20","2","Wah! Setibanya di sana, proses check-in sangat mudah dan lancar. Lokasinya bagus dan semua stafnya sangat ramah. Saking ramahnya, kami sampai mengubah rencana dan mencoba memesan kamar untuk malam berikutnya. Saya meminta petugas concierge untuk memesan kamar untuk malam berikutnya dan meminta saya melakukannya secara online. Saya naik ke kamar untuk memesan kamar untuk malam berikutnya, lalu turun untuk mengonfirmasi bahwa check-out akan dilakukan sehari kemudian. Dia bilang semuanya baik-baik saja dan check-out kami sudah dijadwalkan. Keesokan harinya, resepsionis menelepon saya untuk memverifikasi pemesanan kami. Saya turun dengan email konfirmasi dan mereka bilang saya memesan kamar resor, bukan kamar deluxe tower. Saya bertanya mengapa resepsionis mengatakan semuanya baik-baik saja padahal tidak. Mereka meminta saya membayar tambahan Rp300.000 untuk kamar yang sama. Sangat merepotkan! Saya harus menjelaskan situasinya kepada 4 staf yang berbeda, dan ketika saya setuju untuk membayar tambahan tersebut, saya harus naik dan mengambil kartu kredit saya yang sudah mereka simpan. Entah mengapa mereka membutuhkannya lagi. Ketika saya meminta kompensasi, mereka bilang tidak bisa berbuat apa-apa. Anda mungkin berpikir resor dengan standar seperti ini akan lebih memperhatikan pelanggan mereka ketika staf mereka melakukan kesalahan."
"704.","Leica Cen HP","24","2020-01-20","2","Rata-rata sejauh ini, tidak ada staf yang menawarkan bantuan ketika saya bertemu rekan kerja di sana, atau karena hotel ini termasuk salah satu hotel tertua di Bali. Bangunan dan lingkungan sekitarnya sangat bagus untuk wisatawan yang juga menghadap pantai."
"705.","Kim Fuglsbjerg","189","2020-01-20","2","Hotel tua lusuh di lokasi yang sempurna di Sanur. Jangan pilih kamar termurah, kamar mandinya usang dan benar-benar menjijikkan. MINTALAH UPGRADE. Makanan dan minuman di hotel ini mahal dan sarapan prasmanannya membosankan. Berjalanlah sedikit menyusuri pantai ke arah selatan dan nikmati sarapan lezat serta hidangan lainnya."
"706.","Wendy Russell","4","2020-01-20","2","Hotel ini sama sekali tidak melayani tamu Barat. Sarapan hanya untuk warga lokal dan tidak disebutkan saat pemesanan. Harus mencolokkan ketel di lantai karena tidak ada stopkontak di area kopi atau kamar mandi. Sangat kecewa, tidak direkomendasikan untuk orang Australia atau yang berbahasa Inggris."
"707.","Dan N","8","2020-01-20","2","Keluarga saya punya pengalaman buruk dengan dokter dan perawat di Inna Bali Garden yang mencoba menipu kami saat bayi kami sakit. Mereka mencoba menagih kami Rp2,2 juta (sekitar AUD $220) untuk pemeriksaan rutin dan beberapa produk bebas (air elektrolit dan zinc), yang harganya beberapa dolar di Bali. Perilaku mereka sungguh memalukan, dan saya menduga pihak hotel sangat menyadari hal ini dan mungkin mendapat potongan. Tidak ada seorang pun yang memberi tahu kami berapa 'harganya' karena mereka mematok harga yang berbeda-beda tergantung negara asal tamu: jika Anda orang Australia, Anda 'kaya' dan pantas dieksploitasi. Saya hanya membayar sebagian kecil dari yang mereka minta, tetapi kami semua pulang dengan rasa kecewa yang mendalam dan tidak akan pernah menginap di tempat ini lagi atau merekomendasikannya kepada siapa pun."
"708.","Hubert Borg","50","2020-01-20","2","Tempat ini perlu renovasi/pembongkaran serius dan membangunnya kembali. Ketika Anda masuk ke koridor tempat kamar-kamarnya berada, seperti Anda memasuki rumah sakit logam tua dengan ekor yang tinggi di setiap tempat dengan soffit yang semuanya bernoda karena atap bocor. Kamar-kamarnya tua dari tahun 70-an, semua pintu rusak dan terkelupas, kamar mandinya tua karena pancuran kakek saya tidak berfungsi. Anda membuka keran (yang direkatkan dan diperbaiki dengan semen) di pagi hari dan pada malam hari Anda mungkin mendapatkan air yang keluar darinya (tetesan), toilet Anda perlu menyiramnya setidaknya 5 kali untuk menghilangkan endapan Anda, handuk tidak perlu digantung, mereka tetap lurus di sana sendiri. Kotak brankas portabel Anda dapat mengambilnya dan pergi keluar dengannya, semua perabotan rusak dan goyang, tempat tidur sekeras batu dan pegas kasur menandai punggung Anda. AC ada di sana untuk mengisi lubang di dinding karena membuat kebisingan dan hampir tidak mengeluarkan udara (mungkin kerabat dari kamar mandi) dan Anda perlu tidur dengan penyumbat telinga karena yang lain tidak bisa tidur. Semua ubin lantai rusak dan bernoda. Satu-satunya yang berfungsi adalah TV."
"709.","Knut Kambestad","1","2019-01-20","2","Mendapatkan late check-out awalnya terasa mustahil. Ketika disepakati bahwa pembayaran untuk salah satu kamar akan dilakukan di akhir masa inap, tiba-tiba kami harus membayar di muka. Hotelnya sangat besar, dengan tiga lobi, sehingga sulit untuk check-in di dua tipe kamar yang berbeda, karena mungkin harus melewati lobi yang berbeda. Di salah satu restoran, seorang pelayan menumpahkan minuman ibu saya. Tidak akan merekomendasikan hotel ini, dan akan menghindarinya lagi di masa mendatang."
"710.","桐野利秋","941","2019-01-20","2","Banyak tamu tur yang menyukai warna merah. Ada juga tamu tur yang menyukai patung wanita penghibur.

"711.","Norman Young","71","2019-01-20","2","Dari luar tampak bagus, tetapi interiornya ketinggalan zaman dan terbengkalai. Layanan pengaduan buruk. Stafnya tidak ramah dan tidak membantu. Bangunan utama masih mempertahankan kemegahan era Suharto."
