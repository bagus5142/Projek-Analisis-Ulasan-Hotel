"1.","Pia Claire","35","2026-01-02","4","Loved the colonial style feel. Location is great. Rooms are large and very clean, though starting to showing some age and wear and tear. I was in a room on the top floor and heard very little from other guests in the hall or from their rooms. The nightly turndown service was a nice touch. Staff were friendly. Something to note - the aircon is very loud. Other reviews mentioned this too and this was also my experience. Pool area is small with limited shaded cabanas and pool lounges (which when I visited were in the sun) but does the job. The connected Cork Restaurant is not part of the hotel but they have an arrangement for room service and offer a small discount to hotel guests. I've been there several times on previous visits. The food is still good but I miss the old menu items. Would recommend to future travellers and would return, despite the noisy air con."
"2.","Michelle Barnes","108","2025-12-09","4","After the villa experiences, this boutique hotel was so comfortable. Not too big but not too small. Not super high quality hotel service but cosy and friendly and nothing was uncomfortable. I could have enough privacy and room service meal was ok. Bedding was good, storage area is big enough for long term stay, too. There is a open restaurant in down stairs and they have live performance every night so if you are too sensitive with noise, need to be careful to choose this hotel. We were happy to stay here and can recommend to people who stays in Sanur. There is no bath tub, so if there is a bath chair or something like that in the shower area, easier to wash toes and look after legs ( after walking and swim in the sea often needed to clean my heels and legs so I wished if I had a little stool or something inside of the shower which is made by plastic. This is the idea from current Japanese hotel called Remm hotel (have several branches and they focus on good quality of sleep the room is tiny but has good rain shower room ). Anyway thank you for comfortable stay."

They delivered a mini birthday cake to our room as a surprise which was incredible. The pool area is stunning, as per previous reviews it is not full sun all day, but you get most of the day has sun, and there is some lovely green foliage around the pools. The room decor is supreme, it is so clean, and every consideration is met. They also offer turn down service and leave a sweet treat on the bedside, which shows that they go the extra mile. The breakfast buffet is small but delicious and fresh. You can order food to the pool which is handy. Overall, an amazing experience and I will be back!"

"5.","Titis Setyari","11","2025-11-09","5","Absolutely love this place.. 💕 We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. The room was spacious offering a nice comfortable room. The staff were very nice and polite. The pool area was lovely. Great place to stay with family. Highly recommend this place to everyone visiting Sanur"
"6.","yossaya kongsawadchok","39","2025-08-09","3","Overall, I had a nice experience staying at Maison Aurelia Sanur. The room was clean and the location is quite central within the Sanur area, which is very convenient. However, I was a bit disappointed with the hotel’s spa service. I had booked a treatment expecting something more refined, considering the price I paid for the room. Unfortunately, the spa fell short of standard practices: they didn’t offer any selection of massage oils, nor did they provide a form to ask about allergies or sensitive areas before starting. The therapist also didn’t clean my feet before beginning the massage, which is normally standard, especially as I had just come in from outside and didn’t feel completely clean. Additionally, toward the end of the massage, the therapist moved on to massage my head and face without first washing or wiping her hands. This felt quite unhygienic to me, as her hands still had oil from massaging my body and feet. This lack of attention to cleanliness was quite surprising and, in my opinion, unprofessional. Therefore, I wouldn’t recommend using their spa services. That said, the staff at the reception and restaurant were friendly and helpful, which I appreciated."
"7.","Nicole Pettersson","11","2025-08-09","5","What an absolutely fantastic hotel. Perfect in every way! Staff: delightful, friendly & professional. Housekeeping: meticulous. Loved the little biscuits, chocolates & treats they put on the bed as part of the downturn service. Really appreciated the bottles of water per day & coffee & tea being replaced during the day. Good to see the drinking water in supplied in glass bottles for the sake of the environment. Location: Maison Aurelia is located in the perfect spot. Lots of cafes, restaurants, day spas, pharmacies, a huge supermarket & convenience stores right outside your door. Close to the beach & Icon Bali too. No bus tour groups either. Hotel: Gorgeous swimming pool & spa. Well-maintained in lovely gardens. Plenty of sun beds & a few different pools suitable for the little ones. Meals are good-service is great! I enjoyed the live music. Such a fun bonus. Room: The Camellia room is huge & the bed is extremely comfortable. There is a choice of two shower heads. There’s a sitting area, a desk & a comfortable chair to relax on. There’s also a little balcony area too. Room keys & AC worked consistently the entire week. I enjoyed using the coffee machine & pods supplied. I highly recommend Maison Aurelia & will definitely be back next year. It is a brilliant hotel. Don’t hesitate to book!"
"8.","Malika Kasmi","87","2025-11-09","4","Nice boutique hotel we love the family room it was spacious enough for a family of 4.. the overall decor is vintage.. breakfast buffet very limited but they have a la carte menu as second option"
"9.","Bobby Sumarkho","1384","2025-07-09","5","Awesome boutique hotel in the heart of Sanur. Walking distance to the beach and to many choice of restaurants. I love the spacious 36 square meter camellia suite with sofa seating area, very comfortable bed and pillows, balcony and very good sound proof window that blocked noises despite facing the street. It was a great 3 nights stay. Will definitely stay here again. Sanur is my choice of area now for quiet stay away from big city."
"10.","Wina Devia","7","2025-05-09","5","The most valued hotel. Very clean! The floor like spotless, no sinus allergy when i stayed there. Took the magnolia suites, the best decision ever for that price and the location. 1 living rm, 1 king size bed room and 1 twin size bed room with attached toilet in each room. The staff is super nice, prompt and helpful. Very very very recomended!"
"11.","OKKY DAS","1","2025-08-09","3","I was disappointed with the breakfast during my recent stay. There was no buffet, only one menu item allowed per person, and just one complimentary coffee or tea— any extras were charged. This felt quite restrictive and not in line with what I expected from a hotel of your standard. I hope you consider revising this policy for a better guest experience."
"12.","sarah patchett","13","2025-09-09","5","Just wow !! This hotel was our last stop of our holiday . We stopped from the 23rd August and checked out on the 27th . The location is fantastic, rooms are so spacious and very very clean. The staff are so lovely and there is nothing they will not do for you . Food is amazing 👏 we would definitely stay here again and recommend it . Thankyou to you all for making the end of our holiday so lovely . Sarah & Dave Patchett"
"13.","Quayum Miah","31","2025-05-09","5","Our overall favourite of the four hotels we stayed at during 2 weeks in Bali. The Magnolia suite was spacious, clean and had good storage, although some general wear and tear marks throughout on walls particularly. The pool was never too busy with beds and loungers always available. What really separates this hotel from others was their professionalism, attention to detail, and clearly strong expertise in hospitality, balanced with Balinese charm. They provided many little amenities like free spring water machines on each floor, adjusting their food menu to cater for our needs etc which really added value to our stay. The staff were superbly trained in knowing what guests needed. The nasi goreng was simply the best we had in Bali. The only downside would be the relatively high cost of breakfast in comparison to restaurants on the doorstep. Location is superb, with a brilliant restaurant across the road and many others nearby. We would absolutely stay here again."
"14.","Donovan Chua","20","2025-01-09","5","My recent stay in the Camelia room at Maison Aurelia exceeded all expectations. The hotel graciously accommodated my requests for a high floor and quiet room, which paid off with stunning views from the private balcony. The room itself was impeccable - spotlessly clean with an incredibly comfortable bed that made for perfect nights' sleep. What truly sets this hotel apart is its staff - from the warm, welcoming smiles at the front desk to their attentive service throughout my stay. They're always ready to assist with any request, making you feel genuinely valued as a guest. The location is absolutely perfect. While I didn't opt for the hotel breakfast (though it looked tempting), there are numerous eateries within walking distance. The beach is just a short stroll away, and having The Pantry store right across the street was super convenient for picking up snacks and essentials. Don't miss their spa services - they provide exceptional massage from their experienced therapist in their pristine spa facilities. The whole experience is guaranteed to be therapeutic and professional. Ideal for travelers who appreciate boutique luxury with personalized service. Will definitely return on my next visit to Sanur!"
"15.","Laura Khairunnisa","68","2025-05-09","5","We stayed at Maison Aurelia Sanur for one night as a family of five (two adults, two young children, and a nanny) and had a lovely experience. The hotel has a warm, boutique atmosphere, and the staff were incredibly kind and professional — especially when one of our children fell sick. They handled the situation in the elevator with such care and understanding, which left a very positive impression on us. Overall, Maison Aurelia Sanur is a wonderful choice for families looking for comfort, convenience, and a personal touch in Sanur. We would happily stay here again on a future visit."
"16.","Joerg Tan","178","2025-05-09","5","This is THE perfect hideaway in a bustling Sanur. The rooms are well appointed and cosy in every aspect. The rooms felt like more premium with little touches that made it our most comfortable stay in Bali. The check-in in was seamless and staff were all well trained. They were polite and able to always handled a task with good demeanour. We had to change our payment method after partner used a different card than originally intended. Staff were able and politely in dealing with the transaction. We love the rooms and be quick to book, especially during peaks. We'd to be back when we visit."
"17.","Simon Crutchley","13","2025-05-09","5","Very happy with this. Rooms had good air conditioning with blackout curtains and very comfortable beds. Breakfast was included and that was really good. Convenient location to walk around Sanur. The pool was ok, nice to cool off but there are places with better pools if that's what you would prefer."
"18.","Gan Yee Yoon","48","2025-06-09","5","A wonderful boutique hotel located in Sanur with comfortable and clean rooms, walkable distance to convenience stores, spa, restaurants (try Batujimbar located right across the hotel). This area is close to kids attractions such as zoo, safari and bird park. The magnolia room is very comfortable for 4 pax, whilst the Camelia room is also spacious even with an extra bed. The staff are pleasant, warm and friendly. The breakfast choices are quite limited (small buffet spread - fruits, cereal, pastries) with a menu for ala carte order (1 dish per person). After 3 days, the option becomes quite limited. I would recommend this hotel to travellers."
"19.","Rick and Tammy saberton","30","2025-12-09","5","Spacious rooms good location, impeccably clean, good service, good price restaurants all around, walking distance to beach."
"20.","Shashwat","7","2025-03-09","5","Excellent, excellent hotel. Clean rooms and pool. The most courteous staff (except for when the bellboy rang the bell rapidly at 5:30 pm to inform us of the following day's weather report -- not sure why it was so urgent?) Extremely convenient location; most drivers in Bali know the place. They offer free cycles, which are helpful. Would visit again."
"21.","Emily Rockliff","7","2025-01-09","5","We loved this hotel! Fantastic service, food, location and value. The rooms were exactly like the photos, which is rare! The Magnolia suite has 2 bathrooms and a decent sized lounge in between the bedrooms, so it was perfect for a family of 2 adults and 2 teens. Location perfect for exploring Sanur. Would absolutely recommend."
"22.","Dalong Luo","32","2025-01-09","5","Maison gave off “Shangrila” modern living vibes. Within the hotel, the living space is spacious and items are where you want them to be.. it seemed to have been very well thought out as I need to work while the family enjoyed their holiday. I found the lighting, chair comfort, table size and even aircon (cool and yet with low wind) to be perfect - You know if you know. One handy tip is to bring a laundry line and string outside the balcony for drying clothes. Of worthwhile mention, their restaurant Cork is definitely a hidden gem. We experienced a 5* service and food suitable for families - The food, taste and presentation, and service staff is definitely a unique offering worthwhile of a visit if you are not staying in Maison. Maison also showcases art pieces for guests to appreciate. It was very wonderful to be able to read the what must have been going on in the artist’s mind and his rendition of Bali in his photo shoots. I minded though that towels were exchanged on a daily basis even though signs put up stated that exchange was done only if towels were put on the floor or in the bath. Perhaps a little less service and more environmental awareness please. As we ran out of the 1.5L mineral water we got from the nearby stores, the water dispenser’s bottled water also ran out in the middle of the night. Room service gave us as many water bottles as we liked the next day. We took 4 more than entitled and we’re grateful. Overall 6/5 stars for value, food and stay experience. Will stay again."
"23.","Suzette Meroiti","42","2025-01-09","5","I have stayed many times at this beautiful hotel and I cannot fault it. Fabulous, friendly, helpful staff. The bed is large and very, very comfortable. The Cork restaurant has beautiful food. The spa is also well priced, and the ladies do a great massage. And this hotel is extremely well maintained. Fabulous location with the supermarket a minutes walk away. The pool is a great temperature, not Luke warm like so many. Loungers are always available. Few children. Highly recommend."
"24.","Ebsy Wooo","176","2025-01-09","5","I had a very comfortable and nice time here especially since the two nights staying here I actually slept like a zombie! The room was very spacious to the extent of having two separate a/c units and controllers. The pool area is nice though the pool isn't very large but still usable. The gym is rubbish tbh with the single treadmill out of action and dumbells only going up to 15kg.. Some aspects to consider. I would only book a room only without breakfast as they only provide a continental buffet or a menu option for hot food and there's tons of amazing eateries everywhere anyway. Strangely no toothbrush kits are provided so worth noting. They do provide a free biscuit every night and turnover service. There are water dispensers on each floor for water. It's also only minutes to the beach side and everything is close by. Finally, there's also a usable balcony for each room."
"25.","Beat Ctrl","11","2025-04-09","5","I spent Balinese new year 2025 here, and it was a wonderful stay. Ms.Pratsna the staff at the Lobby was really kind and attentive (I'm not sure that I spell her name correctly or not) she gave me all the information about hotel service in Silence day and inform everything I should know about, she recommend the place that I can see Ogoh Ogoh parades. overall I love all the details in the room, plus with the super soft pillow"
"26.","FootballCardsand StickersIndonesia","72","2025-08-09","4","Yang Utama sy Amazed hotel ini masih menerapkan turn down bed dan kasih Snack gratis steleh turn down bed service, kamar dan ranjang nyaman dan bersih, hanya PARKIRANya sempit dan ribet di gang kecil dan kolam jacuzzi dingin ada beberapa keramik di siku ujung tajam agak berbahaya buat yang tidak tau, tapi overall sy Amazed, design kamar sy suka, almost done deh... Harga mungkin hmmm agak mahal 2,6jtaan tanpa breakfast, mungkin kalo kisaran 2jt dibawah dikit itu pas"
"27.","Enid G","36","2025-06-09","5","Our room was large, comfortable, and very clean. The bed was super comfortable. The staff were wonderful. We travelled with our baby and they were very helpful with providing us with baby items we needed."
"28.","Luthfia Aditia Mimbi","7","2024-01-09","5","Stayed here for 4 nights on a business trip, and it was fantastic. The staff were very helpful during my stay, the room itself was gorgeous. If you prefer hotels with nice interiors, this place is for you. Tons of Balinese details around the hotel and the room. The hotel smells so good. The welcome drink (cinnamon tea) is delicious, the staff even taught me how to brew the drink. Breakfast needs more variations, though (it was probably because I stayed for 4x breakfast. It got a bit boring). Overall, it was a great experience!"
"29.","Cecilia L","17","2025-01-09","5","Staff was lovely and often welcomed us with greetings. The decor of the lobby and rooms were nice. Room was spacious as well. One criticism is that there was only one working lift for all the guests. It seems that the other one was reserved for the staff as I saw they came out of it but it never worked for the guests."
"30.","Bima Susilo","17","2025-01-09","5","Just had the most incredible stay at Maison Aurelia in Sanur, Bali with my family, and let me tell you, it was pure magic! Our spacious room was a dream - plenty of room for the kids to sprawl out, and the comfy beds ensured everyone slept like royalty. Speaking of relaxation, the pool was the perfect place to cool off under the Bali sun. It was clean, refreshing, and just the right size for splashing around with the little ones. And for those moments when you need a quick workout, the gym, though small, had everything you need to stay active. But here's the real star of the show: the service! The staff at Cork Restaurant were absolutely phenomenal. They were attentive, friendly, and always willing to go the extra mile to make sure our experience was top-notch. From delicious breakfasts to helpful recommendations for exploring Sanur, they truly made us feel welcome. Little touches like the complimentary bottled water and welcome snacks waiting in our room upon arrival made a big difference too. You can tell Maison Aurelia cares about the details, and it shows! This wasn't our first stay at Maison Aurelia. We actually came here during the pandemic, and it's amazing to see how this beautiful hotel has not only survived but thrived! They've clearly put a lot of love and effort into maintaining their high standards, and it definitely pays off. Here's my honest recommendation to all you travelers out there: If you're looking for a luxurious yet family-friendly haven in Sanur, look no further than Maison Aurelia. You won't regret it! P.S. Don't forget to indulge in the bathroom amenities - the shampoo and shower gel smell and feel divine! Trust me, after a long day of exploring, it's the perfect way to unwind."
"31.","Nik","63","2025-01-09","5","What an incredible place to stay! Location is perfect for Sanur. The staff are so friendly and welcoming. The rooms are absolutely exceptional and so spacious. So many nice touches like they leave you a different Balinese treat to try every day when they fix your room and a card to tell you the weather for the next day. I really recommend this hotel if you want to stay in Sanur!"
"32.","大嶋和樹","519","2025-01-09","4","I remember the friendly staff and the smell of tuberose in the lobby. The friendly staff also provided a delicious Western-style breakfast. The pool was shared and many guests used it. Most of the guests were Australian and Korean family travelers. There are many really good accommodations in the Sanur area, but this was a really good hotel for the price. If there was one drawback, it was that there was a hot storage unit instead of a refrigerator, which was very disappointing. I had to drink hot water and drinks every time."
"33.","Phil Briggs","29","2025-02-09","5","We stayed here over Xmas 2024 and it is a fab hotel, located right on the Main Street of Sanur, close to all the great restaurants. The rooms are huge and the beds are so comfortable- hard to find in Bali. We were so impressed, we booked for 2 weeks in August whilst we were there"
"34.","Akarapol Chongwattanaroj","22","2025-01-09","4","Great rooms and location, but lacks in one area: the breakfast… If there is one thing (sorry, one of two things) this very nice hotel falls short of, it is its continental breakfast selection. It is extremely limited, considering that I myself is very easy with food and only get several staples such as coffee and eggs. However, the buffet only offers hard boiled eggs (no other options - ordering other types of eggs meaning you’d have to pay more, and that applies to coffee as well). The suggestion is you could increase the price of the breakfast and offer free flow eggs and coffee on request, and that would really improve the overall experience. Currently it is really a let down. The other shortfall is subjective, but the gym is extremely tiny and also very limited in its equipment."
"35.","baba zou","4","2025-04-09","1","I really don't understand why anyone would recommend this place. I don't even want to give it one star. I was completely tricked by the reviews. Take a look at the drinking water provided by this hotel. Is this something people can drink? There were even hairs on the bed. The service attitude was also really bad. This is the worst place I've stayed at in Bali. I will definitely complain to the platform. Please don't come here."
"36.","Peter Bassett","49","2025-01-09","5","The Maison Aurelia has become our go to hotel over several years. So much so that when we check in the super friendly reception staff always says 'welcome home'. The rooms are spacious and very clean and comfortable. The location is smack in the middle of Sanur with loads of restaurants and shops to the left and the right as you walk out the door. But, the reason we started coming back was the service. During COVID we became acquainted with one of the Supervisors named Ari. Since then she has always been very helpful and responsive with any booking questions, general Bali information and recommendations. I love the place."
"37.","My La","97","2025-01-09","5","My review on this: - The room: Spacious! That's the first thing I noticed. The bed was very comfortable and I slept really well. The curtains aren't blackout curtains so if you're a light sleeper that's trying to catch up with your sleep after a big night, best to get eye masks. The bathroom although it's on the smaller side, but it's really what you need. You're able to ask the front desk for amenities however it won't be something readily available in your bathroom. I love how they have turn down service. I always look forward to what snack they'll bring me at night. - facilities: I like how they provide water cooler on each floor! Such a good thing to have. The pool area is nice and it's by the restaurant - in-room dining: the hotel and the restaurant are managed by 2 different groups, hence you can't opt to charge your meal to your room. That was a bit inconvenient to have to pay every single time I order for food vs getting it charged to the room. - breakfast: breakfast menu was good and simple. I was happy with it - staff: the hotel staff are fantastic! Very helpful. and friendly. On the other hand, the restaurant staff wasn't as friendly. Overall, it was a great experience! Will come back again if I happen to need to stay in Sanur."
"38.","Kelly K","3","2025-01-09","1","I really Do NOT recommend this hotel. If you love noise and lack of service and privacy, you can still stay here. They gave me a room right on the roof at the first floor saying it has a pool view. You can only see the roof from your room. And as windows are facing other guest rooms, you will not want to stay at the balcony. At night, you will hear quite noisy songs all over. Now, at 11 in the morning, they are doing some kind of construction right next to my door without informing me or excusing it. I called the reception but they would only say, sorry. Why do I have to endure this paying the same room rate with others?"
"39.","francesco fiaschi","12","2025-01-09","5","I do not write reviews and this resort prompted me to write one. This is probably the best location in Sanur if you are looking for a peaceful vacation .This place felt quiet and peaceful through our entire stay. Very close to the airport and beach.. Staff members are also very helpful. Rooms are big and super clean with amazing design. Thoroughly impressed, highly recommended. well worth the money. Great Management."
"40.","Sue Choe","3","2025-01-09","5","This hotel has fantastic staffs. I stayed in well known 5star hotels too but never felt like so welcomed and well looked after like this one. Especially Ari. She was so helpful and kind. I could see her genuinely wanted me to have the best time there. Such pleasant stay. Wish i could stayed longer and i will choose this one again without hesitation."
"41.","Leah McKay","15","2025-01-09","5","I was here for a week, with one person ill the whole time. The hotel staff provided an excellent doctor who was able to start treatment immediately. The pool is shady which is lovely in the bali heat. It's about a 5-10 min walk to the hotels and restaurants on the beachfront and a 5 min cab ride to the new shopping centre. The hotel spa was inexpensive and the therapist was very good for balinese massage. I will be staying here next time."
"42.","Kylee Carlyle","186","2025-01-09","5","Fabulous hotel, all the staff are super helpful and very friendly... Excellent location an easy walk to the beach, plenty of eateries just outside the door. The rooms are massive and very luxurious. The only downside would be the loud music from a couple of bars on the street but doesn't play all night.."
"43.","Michał Marcinkiewicz","44","2025-01-09","5","Great hotel with a great location. Many good restaurants in close neighborhood, 10-minute walk to the beach, the hotel itself feels very new and has a nice local touch. We are having a great week here and if we ever come back to Bali, we'll stay here"
"44.","Knudson Shawn","19","2024-01-09","5","We always stay here. Have for years. Service is impeccable. Rooms are great spacious and if you want a room that is divided for your teenager and one for you than this is a terrific hotel. CORK is downstairs and has a nice menu. One of the few places to get a large iced long black at 6:30 am so it is fabulous for early risers."
"45.","Randi","135","2024-01-09","5","A lovely boutique hotel located in Sanur. This is my second time staying at the hotel. Spacious room and comfortable bed. Breakfast is tasty, however, it does not provide a wide selection of foods. Staff are friendly and helpful. If you're looking for a great value hotel in Sanur, and you are not looking for a resort styled hotel, then this hotel is the right choice!!"
"46.","Deepali","20","2024-01-09","5","Good centrally located boutique hotel. Many restaurants within walking distance. Rooms were spacious, clean and well stocked. Breakfast was good too, and restaurant staff were very helpful and friendly (we didn't have this in our room rate but ordered a la carte which was reasonably priced). Good value for money - would stay again. Recommend if you aren't fussed about being on the beach itself."
"47.","David Joseph","7","2025-01-09","5","I stay here with my family for a weekend, and the stay is great, room is comfy and large like a good boutique hotel. The location us great that near with other good restaurant. Will definitely come back again."
"48.","Kristine P","11","2024-01-09","5","Great rooms, great service. We stayed 7 nights, and had a very positive experience. There is a restaurant and wine bar attached to the hotel. Good bar. Restaurant is good service and atmosphere, but a bit hit& miss with lunch and dinner dishes. Great breakfast though. Large rooms and quiet location, not far from the beach."
"49.","Al Mulenga","4","2023-01-09","5","We stayed at the weekend. My family and I felt like we were in Paris. The rooms are furnished to a very high 5 star standard. The hotel is truly Boutique as they have less than 50 rooms. All amenities were excellent. The service impeccable. Thank you to Ari Cahyani for the welcome note and the fruit basket. Amazing service. All the staff are attentive to all their guests and greet you with a smile. Services long gone in some hotels ! Well done to the staff and Management of Maison Aurelia. We loved all the artworks. Will recommend and stay again."
"50.","Kush Santokh","16","2025-01-09","5","We absolutely love it here! It’s clear that the team at Maison Aurelia strive for excellence in every way and their attention to detail is only exceeded by our appreciation. The rooms are beautiful and tastefully decorated (true to the photograph online), spacious and super clean. The bed is very comfortable and we always sleep well. The food is delicious. The location is also very convenient. Thank so much to all the staff for their, care, kindness and generosity! We truely appreciate all that you do everyday and the lovely energy you have created at Maison Aurelia. Thank you so much Pauline, Gusti, Ari, Prastha, Wulan, Popy, all the beautiful staff at front desk, the friendly and helpful door staff, the warm restaurant staff, the amazing house keeping team (my sincere apologies I can’t remember all your lovely names), and Ayu, the most wonderful massage therapist. We look forward to our next stay. Many thanks and best wishes!"
"51.","Nina Gouw","47","2024-01-09","5","This hotel was recommended by a friend around 4-5 years ago but I never got the opportunity to check it out coz I mostly prefer to stay in Ubud. The location is simply amazing! It is situated right across my all-time favorite Cafe Batujimbar, which is a great spot to grab a cup of coffee or a quick bite. Additionally, there are numerous shops, bars, and restaurants in close proximity, providing me with plenty of options to explore and indulge in the local cuisine and culture. Service is trully exceptional. All staff from door-men to housekeeping are very attentive and polite. They make sure our stay is as smooth and hassle-free as possible. Apart from the mattress that needs to be replaced due to wear and tear, The Magnolia Suite that we stayed for 6 nights was well-equipped with everything one would expect from a 4-star hotel. The attention to detail was impeccable, with thoughtful touches such as turn down service, slippers, and cozy bathrobes, among other standard amenities that made our stay even more comfortable and enjoyable."
"52.","mai landari","348","2023-01-09","5","Awal April 2022 bertepatan dg awal Ramadhan saya menginap disini dg keluarga, tapi baru sempat mengulas saat ini. Ke Bali setelah 2 th tdk liburan pas ke Sanur di jln Danau tamblingan masih sepi karena dampak covid, tapi hotel ini lumayan banyak yg menginap. Saya cek in mendadak karna rencana balik tapi ingin stay lagi di Sanur jadi saya langsung datang ke hotel udah sore namun resepsionis nya ramah & membantu sekali utk cek in. Welcome drinknya juga seger banget. Kita di hantarkan ke kamar dan semua fasilitas dijelaskan dg sangat teliti. Saya kesini dg keluarga serta mama jadi kita pesen yg kamar konekting, yg ada teras yg duduk-duduk Santai. Kamar lumayan bersih, rapih dan ada mineral, teko buat membuat kopi/ teh lengkap semua, minibar, kulkas kecil, peralatan mandi lumayan lengkap. Sabun beraroma rempah-rempah. Serasa banget di spa..ada spa berbayar. Berhubung saat bulan puasa saya muslim jadi kita utk sarapan request menu sahur dan mereka menyediakan menu pilihan ada Indonesia food dan Amerika breakfast. Interior disini clasik sekali banyak lukisan, dan bikin betah. Hotelnya tidak terlalu besar tapi nyaman. Kolam renang lumayan sepi ada Gasebo untuk Santai. Restoran makanan lumayan enak utk makan malam. Santai dan tdk begitu rame. Bila ingin ke ATM & supermarket tidak jauh ada Arta sedana tinggal jalan kaki. Ke pantai juga deket. Terimakasih buat staffnya yg sudah membantu kami selama menginap di hotel. Semoga berjumpa kembali. Pengin kesini lagi kalo ke Bali. Sukses selalu ya buat Maison Aurelia Sanur 🙏🙏🙏"

I took out a star because there was a minor misunderstanding at checkout just because of the towels and gowns that they didn't fill as much as they collected. Anyway, I was happy to have a fun Bali trip here for a week."
"54.","Abhinav Sharma","30","2025-01-09","2","Good property but not child friendly at all. I am staying with an infant and they make you come down every time you need to ask them to sterilise baby milk bottles in a microwave. They also make all sorts of excuses to avoid making purées for a child and even charge for it. It’s not a question of money but who charges for and insists on immediate payment ( no signs to be added to the tab) for steaming and making puree of one apple! Good place but wasted potential."
"55.","Miranda J","58","2023-01-09","5","We recently stayed at Maison Aurelia for a week as a family of three in a two bedroom suite. The room was a great size with two bathrooms. It was quiet and modern, and we liked the decor. The hotel pool and spa were fantastic and we made frequent use of the daybeds. All of the staff were friendly and helpful. It’s in a central location in Sanur and we wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again."
"56.","Peters Chris","7","2025-01-09","5","Fantastic hotel in Sanur. The cleanest place we stayed the entire time in Bali (Ubud, Lovina, Seminyak and Sanur). The service is off the charts. Super polite and helpful staff. One of the receptionists even contacted the bakery that supplies a cookie they give to guests so we could go buy some directly. Location is great as well. Easy access to the beach, restaurants and businesses. We requested a room away from the main street so our stay was also very quiet. Would 1000% stay in this place again."
"57.","Shivani Doshi","33","2023-01-09","5","This was one of our favourite hotels in Bali. The staff were very friendly and helpful always. The room itself was much larger than I anticipated, with a great sense of decor and the bed very comfortable. We got two water bottles, which were refilled and we could easily request more. They also gave a useful dental kit. The included breakfast was an option of Balinese food or american food and coffee/tea. We got time in the pool as well. It may have been slightly heated but it was a bit cold when you first get in, then you get used to it. The location was good, with a supermarket around the corner with ATMs and also a lot of places for food and salons too."
"58.","Tari Danawidjaja","44","2024-01-09","5","It was such a lovely boutique hotel in the middle of Sanur. Great location to delicious restaurants and coffee places. Beautiful rooms, with very comfortable bed and pillows!! Loved everything about the room : great lightings, sofa and amenities. I would def recommend this hotel to everyone"
"59.","Jamey Blewitt","20","2024-01-09","5","An impressive centrally located hotel. The hotel is new, so the rooms are fresh and no issues you commonly get from some of the older hotels in the area. We stayed in the family magnolia suite, which has the separated lounge room between a parent and kids room. Great set up and very helpful staff who treat you with professional courtesy. Absolutely recommend this hotel."
"60.","Steve Mantell","3","2023-01-09","5","Love this Hotel! The location is great, the rooms are clean and fresh, the beds and pillows are the most comfortable I have ever slept on. Staff are fantastic and very attentive to all of your needs. Can't wait to get back and stay here again"
"61.","Don MacAuslan","199","2024-01-09","4","Overall a very polished small boutique hotel. The staff and rooms here are the real stars. A special thanks to Gustu and Putu at reception. The only reason we did not rate service 5 stars was the inability to charge food and beverage to our room. With a hotel positioned in the market as it is I believe most guests would expect this basic facility. Having said that the food and service at the adjoining restaurant and bar was great!"
"62.","Ian","425","2023-01-09","5","One of the best hotels in Sanur. Staff and service are polite and helpful. Room is spacious, clean and well-decorated. They give adequate amenities, so no worry. This hotel owns CHSE certificate, it is safe for abroad travelers. Booked at their website for more promo and good price!"
"63.","Nursafira K","60","2023-01-09","5","Menginap dua malam di sini karena tidak terlalu jauh dari pelabuhan dan kami bertujuan untuk one-day trip ke Nusa Penida. Kamarnya nyaman, bersih, dan luas (dengan harga kurang dari dua juta ini paling luas dari semua hotel yang pernah saya tempati). Sarapan ala carte bukan buffet tapi nggak masalah karena american breakfastnya lumayan enak buat saya. Staf cukup ramah. Overall it was a good stay."
"64.","Wientje Tan","496","2024-01-09","5","Very nice boutique hotel if you stay in Sanur area. stay 3 night with very comfy bed , great hospitality. The turn down service provide local sweet delicacies : chocolate, home made cake , pineapple cake. Breakfast French style croque Monsieur with fresh juice . Room facing the Main Street but not crowded."
"65.","taraneh asadian","3","2025-01-09","4","The hotel was clean and chic. I enjoyed staying there. my parents left their passports and 9000 dollars there. we called and they put it aside for us; so after 2 days when we returned we took it back."
"66.","P Photography","570","2023-01-09","5","Beautiful boutique hotel. Clean room with safety deposit box. Comfy beds and pillow. Strategically located in Sanur with lots of shops, restaurants, cafe nearby. There are three pools: for adults, children and one 'warm' pool (jacuzzi) but when we stay here, the water jet/water massage function is not working"
"67.","Nicolas F.","66","2024-01-09","5","Really nice setup, rooms are absolutely clean and spacious, quality is all around. Service at highest level. Will try the restaurant but after a discussion with the chef, a French cook, no doubt it will be stellar! I would certainly recommend!"
"68.","Mindi Pettitt","66","2018-01-09","5","The beds are THE BEST! Spacious modern room with decent furniture. The bathroom is compact. The pool area is the perfect size and quiet enough being as close as it is to the road. Loved it! PS if you are staying here and breakfast is not included it's only 100 Rupiah for a fantastic breakfast."
"69.","Goh BC","125","2024-01-09","5","6 star service and effort! What impressed me the most about Maison Aurelia is the extra miles they took to make your stay much more delightful than just the physical properties. We were greeted with big warm smiles from the staffs, who were very helpful. The daily housekeeping and turndown services are done promptly and tastefully. They also prepared some local snacks / bites with proper introductions. The breakfast was very comfortable and I just loved their fresh watermelon juice, which is free flow btw. Every staff do their part with professionalism and heart. Keep this up!"
"70.","B Cheung","36","2020-01-09","5","The Magnolia Suite we are staying is very spacious and comfortable. I have found one of the safe boxes faulty though but it was fixed the next morning after reporting the problem to the front desk the night before. The air conditioners have been working perfectly and our rooms are very quiet. My whole family could sleep comfortably at night. The only restaurant in the hotel doesn't have a lot in the menu for us to choose from but all the foods we have tried so far are of very high quality. There are many restaurants and cafes nearby anyway we can always try something new everyday. The swimming pool and the gym are fairly small but we didn't use them so I don't have any comments. I have found the staff of this hotel extremely courteous and helpful. The doorman or the security guard always opened the door for us even though sometimes he was not close by. When it rained he brought an umbrella to our car so that we didn't get wet. All the staff I have come across so far always carry a smile on their faces. We have dined in the restaurant twice and now every time my family walked past the staff inside greeted us with smile when they saw us. Well done Maison Aurelia you have a fantastic team which make your customers feel at home. Keep on your good work!"
"71.","Yanu Aryani","599","2024-01-09","5","This boutique hotel is amazing. I came here for business. It is a huge room, clean, nice balcony, so comfort pillows and bed, good rate, great toiletries product, lovely surrounding.. everything is awesome."
"72.","Wayne Herring","142","2019-01-09","5","Clean, large modern rooms with the most comfortable beds and pillows you will find. Reasonably fast WiFi and plenty of TV channels. Friendly staff. Restaurant food good as is the attached spa. Nice pool, only gets sun in the morning though water is a good temperature throughout the day. Highly recommended."
"73.","Helio Rodrigues","512","2020-01-09","3","(-) No water dispenser in the room or anywhere at the hotel - with so much mass tourism and consumption of plastic bottles it's a shame a hotel like this does not give an example but then promoting Earth Hour!? Only 3 bicycles available for this big hotel. Gym room is a joke and only one machine works. Swimming pool area only gets sun til 12/1pm. Whirlpool/Jacuzzi does not work and pool area is not that clean or maintained. (+) We stayed 4 nights and had a great time. Very friendly and attentive staff. Super comfortable bed and room. Those little special treats like chocolate were super nice:) Free bicycles (although only 3 available for the whole hotel and you must reserve in advance). Beach just 10 mins walk away. Lots of restaurants around."
"74.","Fatma sW","9","2023-01-09","5","I love stay here during my vacation in Bali for 4 nights. The room is so spacious, clean, and great interior design. The environment and athmophere is really peaceful, that's great for healing. The staff is friendly and complaints are handled immediately. I'd love to stay here again if I have a vacation in Bali. But, the breakfast menu is less varied. That's a bit dissapointing. But it's okay."
"75.","Mika Affandy","99","2022-01-09","5","Sooo happy with my stay here! From the moment of my check in, until the check out. Everything went so great. They allow me to ask for more water, their shower amenities smells so damn good!!! I want to buy it actually, where can I get the family size of them 😁 room was clean, pool was nice, and they provide the bike for guest, FREE! 😍 …"
"76.","Lyn (淋)","142","2023-01-09","5","Maison Aurelia in Sanur turned out to be a great choice. It was approx 20-30 mins gojek ride from the airport. The hotel was also located within walking distance to multiple food and spa options. There is a grocery store directly opposite the hotel. As well as a supermarket and convenience store within 10-15 mins walk fr the hotel. Including a hair salon if you’re looking to get a haircut. The hotel is only 3 levels high however it’s clean and tastefully decorated. Upon arriving, we were greeted by the hotel attendant who opened the hotel doors for us. The hotel staff at the foyer were friendly and we were offered a nice and cold welcome drink during our checkin. During our stay, the hotel staff including the hotel attendant always greeted us at the foyer when we returned which made us feel really welcomed back. The room is huge and spacious. The room was clean and comfort. We usually request for house keeping when we leave for the day and we returned to a clean room every time we got back from our activities. We also experienced a pleasant surprise when we were given a complimentary small Indonesian sweet wrapped in Pandan leaves during one of the nights of our continuous stay. It was interesting to try. We especially loved the pool area because it was quiet and serene during our stay there. The pool water was a little cold but it was a nice place to spend a lazy afternoon beside the pool. Overall we have had no regrets staying at Maison Aurelia Sanur during our entire time in Bali and would recommend this hotel to our friends."
"77.","Cornelius Mutsaers","229","2025-01-09","5","Fantatic is a great way to discribe Maison Aurelia. Rooms are large and spacious and very clean. Bathrooms are small but versatile. Staff are welcoming in the true Bali spirit. Pool area was quite and easy to relax in their lounges. Had breakfast at the Cork restaurant which was not included in reservation but was very well priced and excellent value. Evening dinners were also good but the bar next door spoilt the evening with its loud band playing for hours. plenty of other restaurants in the area for a quiter dinner. The Maison Aurelia is a 500mtr walk to the Sanur beach."

The bed n pillows were so comfy. It's a pity that it didn't come with a hot tub. The room fragrance was also real nice. The coffee n tea in the room was of a different level. The shower gel, shampoo n condituoner smell real good. The staffs n security guard were all nice, friendly n helpful. The ala carte breakfast was also great n tasty. The food come with fresh fruits juices, infused water n Balinese coffee. Surely we'd love to be back here again next time. Way to go ..."
"81.","Kevin Phang","76","2020-01-09","5","Had a great stay here recently and stayed in their Magnolia Suite. Family of 4. Great experience from check in to our 5 day stay to checkout. Great location with good food around the hotel. If I were to name the areas of improvement... well, spa could do with extending the hours beyond 9pm. Apart from that great beds cozy rooms and friendly service all day."
"82.","Putra Javanian","150","2018-01-09","5","The place is superb! It's pretty cool decoration. The place is quite clean the room was pretty big! Have small gym and small pool but it's okay.

"86.","Mita Afiata","46","2022-01-09","5","Hotel di sanur yg konsepnya menarik. Kamar luas ada balkon dan sofanya. Dekat dengan pantai sanur dan cafe disekitar sanur. Fasiltas kamar seperti sandal, air minum, teh kopi, sikat gigi harus meminta dulu ke resepsionis baru diberi, jika tidak minta tidak akan dikasih. Jadi jangan lupa untuk meminta ke pihak hotelnya. Untuk sarapan hanya terdapat 3 menu yaitu american breakfast, nasi goreng dan mie goreng, teh dan buah. Kurang bervariasi sehingga yang menginap dalam waktu lama akan bosan. Kebersihan kamar bersih, pelayanan baik. Worth to try 👍👌"
"87.","Luke Manning","364","2020-01-09","5","What a wonderful stay we had in Maison Aurelia! The room exceeded our expectations. The bed was honestly the comfiest bed of any hotel I've slept in. Dual air conditioning units kept the room nice and chill to our liking. Wonderful shower as well with all supplies you might need provided. The staff were so friendly and welcoming. Their constant smiling and greetings was almost infectious! How can you not enjoy your stay with staff like that!? The food and bar was also excellent. Great cocktails and tasty food. We ended up eating here 3 or 4 times during our stay and each time it was great. We would have eaten more if the menu had more variety. The pool area is super comfortable with beds and sun chairs available. The spa pool didn't work for the first few day of our stay but we very much enjoyed it for the second half. Bar staff often came out to ask if we needed anything to eat or drink which was welcomed! Nothing better than an ice cold Bintang on a hot day. Girlfriend went to the spa for a message and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I can't comment on this much as I didn't partake but she had nothing but praise for her experience. Now after all that praise.. There was some small issues with our stay: The bath robes clearly had not been changed since the last guests as there was a large tea / coffee stain on one of them.. However this was quickly rectified the following morning when we had the room serviced after we left the bath robes on the bed. The fridge in our room can hardly be considered a fridge. It barely chilled our water and the milk we bought lasted less than two days before going bad. I made sure the fridge was set to maximum. Besides these two very small issues our stay was absolutely fantastic and I would not hesitate to recommend Maison Aurelia!"
"88.","潜宝一一DivingQ","27","2021-01-09","5","This is the only hotel that sent the birthday wish after a few days stay here one year ago. So, here we come again! We love the pillow, the atmosphere, the spa and the food in the Resto. Above all, the staff are very friendly. We have a great sleeping time here. This is already our third time of visit. Highly recommended."
"89.","Dwi Suriantini","69","2020-01-09","5","Kebetulan saat itu hari ulang tahun anak ke-2 saya, staff front office nya sangat ramah dan membantu, dpt welcome drink berupa cinnamon tea dan cookies, mungkin cookies gula aren, sangat Spesial. Diantar menuju kamar oleh staff, dan dijelaskan sekilas mengenai fasilitas kamar. Di kamar sdh disiapkan beberapa balon, dan tdk lama kemudian dtg birthday cake yg sangat enaaaak.... Fasilitas kamar super lengkap, ada sound bluetooth jg. Sofa di tengah Antara TV dan bed, kursi santai di pojokan, dan kursi + meja di balkon. Terdapat kolam air hangat, kolam renang dewasa dan kolam renang anak. Ada fasilitas gym gratis, dan spa berbayar. Hanya sj sedikit kotor oleh dedaunan dan bunga yg gugur di kolam air hangatnya. Tp itu tdk mslh. Sarapan lumayan, waitress ramah. Disini anda bs sarapan di garden, kamar, atau gazebo yg disediakan di pinggir kolam. Hotel ini merupakan boutique hotel. Seluruh hotel berbau rempah Yg sangat khas dan mampu menenangkan pikiran. Saya sangat sangat sangat senang , nyaman dan berterima kasih sekali dengan pelayanan yg super dr hotel ini."
"90.","Djunadi Satrio","124","2023-01-09","2","The good: - the room was good size and has a balcony - kept fairly clean and well kept - location is convenient The bad: - they are on extreme cut back on facilities, amenities and staff - you must request tea/coffee making facilities, and must remind them you need this refilled - you need to request daily housekeeping. The general rule is: no housekeeping is provided, unless you requested. - but when you call the front desk to request it, no one picks up. Kinda contradictory, no?! I called before taking a shower, after shower, after getting ready, right before I was leaving, and NO ONE picked up the phone. On the way out, I stopped by the reception and no one was there. A staff from the restaurant had to fetch someone from a meeting room. - on the last night, the complimentary toiletries were not replenished - we were provided 2 small bottles of water and was informed if we need more we could get from the water dispenser out in the hallway. But no water container was provided at all! At other hotels that has similar arrangements, there is large water contaner/carafe you could fill if you need extra water - I forgot to pack a shaver, and the hotel didn't have any, saying they ran out and won't be providing any anymore. This is an amenity that cost IDR1500 a piece! All in all, a good hotel is tarnished by extreme measures to cut back. What a shame!"
"91.","Taryn Names","15","2023-01-09","4","Hotel room and lobby are very nice for value. Front desk staff is very kind. Breakfast was not good...it was a set menu with 3 options--no vegan or vegetarian choice. I tried to ask for pancakes or muesli + fruit but was told no. Also, there is no non-dairy milk alternative for coffee, just whole milk. For a hotel restaurant in Sanur we were disappointed."

"93.","Upnomad Travel","101","2019-01-09","5","26 November 2018 staycation disini, booking Camellia Room dapat di harga 1.227.000. Experience nya unik stay di boutique hotel kayak Maison Aurelia ini karena Design Interiornya yang tematic ala Classic Colonial Europian, Lokasinya yang Strategis, dan Fasilitasnya yang lengkap, ada swimming pool, gym, jacuzzi, restaurant, dan spa. Ukuran kamarnya juga luas banget, ada living roomnya dan sofa di tengah ruangan yang nyaman banget buat lama-lamaan nonton TV. Dapat view balkon yang menghadap ke swimming makin kece kamarnya. Jarak dari hotel ke pantai batu jimbar juga lumayan dekat, cuma perlu jalan kaki sekitar 5-10 menit saja, udah sampai dan lebih rekomended kalau ke pantainya pagi, karena pantainya menghadap ke timur (Sunrise). Parkir Luas dan Vallet Service di belakang hotelnya. Full video review di channel Youtube “UPNOMAD TRAVEL”."

We will definitely be back !! Note: construction has just started here for a new restaurant and will continue up to xmas so it will be noisy during the day beside the pool area"

The room had super king size bed, 3 seater sofa & still felt spacious. The bed & pillows r heavenly! Food at the restaurant also yums. We had gulai barramundi & carbonara fettucine for dinner. Pasta was OK, a bit too sweet for me, but the fish was excellent! Must try. Hotel itself is located near the beach, closest one is Pantai Karang abt 15 min walk. A bit further, is Pantai Sindhu abt 40 mins walk. Overall, it was a great stay, thank you all Maison Aurelia staff"

Truly great rooms, we were fortunate enough to get a Suite for no money almost. 56 sqm and just terrific. Huge and lovely bed. Super clean bathroom which we were not used to after a few weeks in Bali. Restaurant is top, prices somewhat higher than neighbouring redtaurants and cafés for obvious reasons. Pool area is decent with awesome sun beds and towels free of charge. Haven't tried the spa but the variety of treatments is good. OMG the shower on the room is top 3 ever taken, especially after a long, warm and humid walk in the Sanur sun."
"102.","Ian Prasetyo","187","2018-01-09","4","A hidden gem in Sanur; surprisingly affordable, easy access to the beach. It has that nice, boutique hotel feel. Staff is incredibly nice.

"121.","Christian Jost","13","2023-01-09","5","Nice Boutique Hotel The E-Bike Rental was the best for us. only talk to the reception or make your reservation direct at ebikerental.id under bookings. Sanur by E-Bike is insane fun and makes to move around easy without stress and no swetty. Specially as a couple or with a friend perfect!"
"122.","Kay Choi","19","2025-11-09","4","The room was spacious and comfortable, and the room service staff were very friendly and helpful. I understand that the pool and gym are small, which is fine for a boutique-style hotel. However, the jacuzzi wasn’t working properly, and the bathroom was quite small, with the shower drain not flowing well. The location would be excellent if it weren’t for the ongoing construction on the main road. One downside was that the live music from the nearby bar was very loud at night — the noise continued until around 11 PM, which made it hard to relax. Overall, it was a pleasant stay, but a few maintenance improvements and better soundproofing would make it much better."

Every staff member has this smile that is so infectious.. it brought me so much luck and proprietary in my personal and business life.... The service, rooms, facilities, food, wine list, staff I could write a book on how amazing my stay was...

"150.","M F","36","2020-01-09","5","We ended our Indonesian 2 week trip at Maison Aurélia for 3 nights. I cannot speak highly enough of the staff, but a special shout out and praise must go to Gangga and Ari. When we came from our 4hr drive from Lovina, we were greeted and shown around by one of the trainees, Gangga. Immediately, his smile brightened up the room and I could not help but want to smile back. He was a ray of sunshine and extremely helpful to explain all the amenities. We had a few small issues with things in our room on the first night (is: shower head not functioning properly, overly sensitive smoke alarm in our room,ect). All these issues were immediately fixed, but if it wasn't for Gangga's warm welcome, we were considering moving hotels. I say this but boy am I glad we stayed! The following day when we raised these concerns with the manager, Ari, we were extremely pleased with her concerns to make sure that our experience is one that we would positively remember. Ari, thank you for finding a way to make us feel like we were amongst friends and family everytime we spoke with you. Thank you for finding a way to make up tenfold for the few issues we encountered upon arrival. And finally, thank you for making our final few days in Indonesia amazing for both mum and I. Maison Aurelia is lucky to have both Gangga and Ari, and I cannot recommend this hotel enough!"

"399.","Déborah GROSS","16","2025-12-09","5","Kami menghabiskan dua malam bersama keluarga di Maison Aurelia. Hotelnya luar biasa, begitu pula stafnya. Kamarnya sangat nyaman, sangat bersih, dan tempat tidurnya sangat nyaman. Kolam renangnya indah. Hotel juga menyediakan sepeda dan kursi anak. Berjalan-jalan di sepanjang pantai sangat menyenangkan. Saya sangat merekomendasikannya! Terima kasih kepada Maison Aurelia atas momen-momen indah ini. Kami pasti akan kembali!"
"400.","Nathalie Laffargue","129","2025-11-09","5","Hotel yang luar biasa, sangat bersih, dengan staf yang sangat ramah dan profesional. Kami menikmati empat malam yang luar biasa; tempat tidurnya luar biasa, dan kamarnya luas (satu-satunya kekurangan kecil adalah AC-nya yang sangat berisik). Keunggulan hotel dan restoran ini adalah Anthony, yang sangat ramah dan membantu dalam memudahkan komunikasi. Acara musik kecil-kecilan di malam hari sungguh fantastis; kami sangat menikmatinya."
"401.","지구별여행자","33","2025-09-09","5","Harganya terjangkau, dan lokasinya sungguh luar biasa. Meskipun agak jauh dari Icon Bali dan pantai, lokasinya masih bisa dijangkau dengan berjalan kaki. Pusat yoga Koa Sala berada tepat di seberang jalan, sehingga memudahkan untuk berolahraga. Restoran COKE di lantai satu hotel lezat, bersih, dan ramah. Layanan pijat di hotel terjangkau, dan stafnya sangat ramah. Lokasinya sempurna untuk menjelajahi berbagai restoran lezat di sekitarnya. Kolam renangnya, meskipun kecil, teduh dan cukup nyaman untuk bermain. Satu-satunya kekurangannya adalah keberadaan semut kecil, tetapi mereka tidak menggigit, jadi kami tidak makan di dalam."
"402.","yun","18","2025-12-09","1","Setelah check-in dan menitipkan barang bawaan, saya kembali dan mendapati staf housekeeping masuk lagi ke kamar saat tidak ada orang di dalam kamar dan memindahkan beberapa barang. Penjelasan mereka adalah bahwa housekeeping dilakukan dua kali sehari. Saya tidak menyarankan wisatawan wanita solo menginap di kamar ini, dan ingatlah untuk selalu membawa barang berharga Anda."
"403.","kei natsui","192","2025-07-09","5","Saya menginap selama dua malam di kamar lantai dua (hotel menyebutnya lantai satu dalam gaya Inggris) dengan balkon yang menghadap kolam renang. Angin malam terasa menyenangkan saat saya bersantai di balkon, sambil menyesap bir. Kamarnya luas, pancurannya memiliki banyak air panas, dan desainnya tenang, menjadikan hotel ini sangat nyaman. Ada layanan merapikan tempat tidur, dan pilihan teh dan camilan harian diletakkan di meja samping tempat tidur. Layanan laundry saya juga sangat baik. Kolam renang berada di bawah naungan bangunan hampir sepanjang hari, tetapi itu membuat area di tepi kolam renang lebih sejuk dan nyaman. Sangat cocok untuk bersantai dan membaca. Saya melakukan pijat Bali selama satu jam di spa di sebelah kolam renang. Harganya wajar, lingkungannya bersih, dan mereka sangat membantu dalam menyesuaikan intensitas perawatan sesuai dengan preferensi saya. Lokasinya tepat di tengah jalan utama Sanur, jadi sangat nyaman, dan pantai hanya berjarak 5-6 menit berjalan kaki, jadi tidak ada ketidaknyamanan sama sekali. Saya makan semua makanan saya di luar hotel selama menginap, tetapi lain kali saya menginap di sana, saya akan mencoba restoran di dalam hotel. Tampaknya itu restoran yang populer, dan ramai baik di pagi maupun malam hari."
"404.","SE Y","43","2025-09-09","5","Ulasan ini berdasarkan ulasan keluarga yang terdiri dari 2 orang dewasa dan 2 anak-anak. Kami menginap di Magnolia Suite. Terdapat dua kamar di kedua sisi ruang tamu utama, lebih tepatnya, dua kamar yang terhubung, sehingga menghasilkan dua nomor kamar. Meskipun pemandangan dari kamar kurang bagus, kamar ini memiliki desain klasik, menciptakan suasana hangat dan nyaman. Ruangan ini nyaman untuk empat orang. Ini pertama kalinya saya di Sanur, dan saya mendapati lokasinya hanya satu blok dari pantai, di jalan yang terletak di tengah-tengah antara InterContinental dan Icon Bali. Lokasinya yang strategis, dekat dengan restoran, tempat pijat, pantai, dan Icon Bali, menjadikannya lokasi yang strategis. Melihat ke arah pantai, saya melihat sebuah bangunan besar yang sedang dibangun di sebelah kanan Icon Bali, yang saya pikir akan membuat Sanur semakin ramai. Restoran sarapannya dioperasikan oleh bisnis yang berbeda dari Maison Aurelia Sanur, jadi mereka menawarkan diskon untuk tamu, tetapi itu tidak berarti Anda dapat menagih biaya sarapan ke kamar. Saya merasa makanannya lumayan untuk harganya. Salah satu kekecewaan saya adalah selama 15 malam menginap, saya tidak bisa sepenuhnya menggunakan kolam renang. Airnya jauh lebih dingin daripada tempat lain. Saya rasa alasannya adalah struktur kolam renang yang tidak memungkinkan sinar matahari untuk memanaskan air dengan baik. Sebaliknya, rasanya sangat sejuk untuk berbaring di tempat tidur pantai. Terakhir, ubin di dasar wastafel di kamar mandi kecil itu sedikit terkelupas, setebal sekitar 1 cm. Saya tidak sengaja membenturkan jari kaki saya di sana, menyebabkan sedikit pendarahan. Saya melaporkan masalah ini ke resepsionis. Saya harap sudah diperbaiki. Namun, jika saya kembali ke Sanur, saya pasti akan menginap di sini lagi."
"405.","jamie lee","7","2025-12-09","5","Saya tidak bisa menginap beberapa malam, jadi saya pindah setelah satu malam. Saya menginap sendirian di suite dua kamar tiga kamar tidur. 😅 Nyaman dan menyenangkan, tapi saya orangnya kaku, jadi koneksinya jelek? Mungkin karena kartunya tidak pas, tapi listriknya mati lalu hidup lagi. Saya memasukkan kunci dengan kuat dan memasukkan kertasnya, dan semuanya baik-baik saja. Mereka juga punya bar dan restoran di Cork, jadi makanannya enak. Di hari terakhir, saya menikmati perawatan spa Bali selama satu jam, dan wanitanya sangat ramah. Namun, karena mereka selesai kerja pukul 5, hanya pria yang datang setelah itu."
"406.","아몬드봉봉","122","2025-09-09","5","Hotel ini mendapat ulasan yang sangat bagus sehingga saya menyadari ada alasan di balik ulasannya yang bagus. Pertama-tama, kamarnya sangat nyaman. Saya sempat khawatir setelah membaca beberapa ulasan yang mengatakan kamarnya terlihat tua, tetapi saya tidak menyadarinya sama sekali! Meskipun kamarnya tidak dibersihkan secara menyeluruh, secara umum bersih, dan perabotannya terawat dengan baik. Tempat tidurnya sangat nyaman, dan tempat tidurnya sangat luas! TV-nya ada YouTube, jadi saya bisa menontonnya dengan nyaman dari sofa. Saya tidak menyangka akan sebagus itu, tetapi ada kursi dan meja di teras kecil, jadi saya bisa duduk di luar dan menikmati bir di malam hari. 😃 Mesin kopi dan kapsul disediakan setiap hari, beserta kantong teh dan kopi, yang saya minum setiap hari. Saya hanya melihat kolam renang, dan meskipun tidak besar, itu cukup untuk membangkitkan semangat saya. Lokasinya sempurna untuk pergi ke pantai dan Icon Bali, dan fakta bahwa ada minimarket dan supermarket di dekatnya juga sangat bagus! Terakhir, stafnya sangat ramah! Anak saya mulai merasa mual di pagi hari, yang agak mengganggu, tetapi staf hotel sangat membantu. Staf pria yang membantu kami check-in di resepsionis sangat ramah. Saya sangat merekomendasikan hotel ini di Sanur!! Oh, dan ada beberapa semut! Anda harus berhati-hati dengan apa yang Anda makan."
"407.","C. Smits","23","2025-09-09","5","Hotel yang bagus dan bersih dengan staf yang ramah. Kolam renangnya kecil dan jumlah kursi berjemurnya terbatas. Kami merasa sarapan di Cork Restaurant cukup baik, tetapi saya rasa mungkin terlalu terbatas untuk beberapa orang, terutama karena area prasmanannya yang kecil tidak selalu diisi ulang. Sangat mudah untuk berjalan kaki dari hotel di sepanjang pantai atau ke restoran lainnya."

Saya puas dengan akomodasinya, karena kelebihannya lebih banyak daripada kekurangannya. 😋 😭BURUK + Kolam renangnya kecil. + Renovasi jalan membuatnya agak bising di siang hari saat saya di sana. 😁BAGUS + Semua yang saya pesan untuk sarapan lezat (terutama Nasi Gorengnya 👍) + Lokasinya bagus. - Sekitar 5 menit dari Pantai Sanur. - Sekitar 10 menit dari Icon Bali (lebih mudah berjalan kaki). - Banyak restoran dan pusat perbelanjaan di dekatnya. + Saya mendaftar keanggotaan dan mendapatkan diskon untuk restoran dan pijat. 🧐Pendapat saya tentang perjalanan saya ke Sanur. + Sanur adalah tempat yang tepat untuk bersantai dan melepas lelah. + Tenang. + Cocok untuk berlari di sepanjang pantai. - Ada banyak pelari kalau kamu pergi pagi-pagi. + Matahari terbitnya indah. - Bau rokok di sekitarku agak mengganggu saat menunggu matahari terbit."

Kasurnya bersih dan dalam kondisi baik 🙌🏻👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 Mereka menyediakan air mineral berdasarkan permintaan, dan saya menggunakan filter shower, dan airnya tidak berubah warna. Tempatnya bersih, dan mudah untuk pergi ke Sanur. Sarapannya juga sangat mengenyangkan. Saya sangat merekomendasikan sarapannya!!"

Kami menginap di sana tujuh tahun yang lalu, saat pertama kali dibuka, lalu sekitar enam tahun yang lalu! Dan sekarang! Apa yang bisa saya katakan—sungguh luar biasa! Semuanya luar biasa indah dan bergaya. Hotel ini benar-benar terbaik. Pelayanannya luar biasa, semua orang sangat membantu, tersenyum, dan senang membantu! Kami menyewa sepeda untuk pergi ke pantai! Bersepeda keliling Sanur sungguh menakjubkan! Kamarnya luas, semuanya bersih, dan sangat nyaman! Satu-satunya hal yang ingin saya sampaikan adalah hotel ini sangat bagus, tetapi seiring waktu, pasti ada beberapa hal yang mulai usang. Nat di kamar mandi, kue gratis di malam hari hanya dua, bukan empat, meskipun kami menginap di kamar keluarga untuk empat orang, keran di kamar mandi dan pipa ledeng, dan beberapa hal kecil lainnya… semuanya memang perlu diperbarui! Semuanya masih indah, tetapi tidak sesempurna dulu, dan hotel sekelas ini dengan layanan seperti ini tidak boleh membiarkan detail seperti itu luput dari perhatian. Agar semuanya kembali menakjubkan, detail-detail ini perlu diperhatikan! Secara keseluruhan, semuanya sungguh luar biasa! Sangat direkomendasikan!"
"422.","Irene Fabiani","3","2025-01-09","5","Properti ini terletak di pusat Sanur dan hanya beberapa langkah dari pantai: kami merasa lokasinya sangat strategis, bahkan untuk berbelanja. Hotelnya indah, terawat, dan ramah, serta stafnya sangat ramah dan profesional: semua orang berbicara bahasa Inggris dengan sempurna dan langsung membuat Anda merasa nyaman. Kami menginap selama 5 malam di suite yang sangat luas, bersih, dan terang, berperabot lengkap, dan nyaman. Hotel ini juga memiliki pusat spa, kolam renang yang menenangkan, dan restoran yang lengkap. Penginapannya sangat menyenangkan dan menenangkan!"
"423.","세나","1","2025-05-09","1","Itu adalah pengalaman hotel terburuk. Sebulan yang lalu, saya membuat reservasi di spa hotel ini untuk besok. Namun hari ini, hari check-in, waktunya tepat, jadi saya membuat reservasi spa tambahan untuk hari ini, dan staf hotel juga mengkonfirmasi reservasi tersebut. Namun, ketika saya tiba di toko spa pada waktu yang ditentukan, reservasi hari ini salah dimasukkan untuk besok, dan spa besok, yang saya pesan sebulan yang lalu, tidak ada dalam daftar sama sekali. Ketika saya bertanya kepada staf, mereka mengatakan kepada saya bahwa mereka tidak dapat memesan ulang saya karena terapis sedang berlibur. Saya sempat marah-marah dan minta menelpon pengelolanya, namun pengelolanya juga sedang berlibur sehingga harus menunggu lama. Manajer menengah datang hampir satu jam kemudian, dan kami harus menjelaskan semuanya lagi tanpa memahami situasinya. Mereka akhirnya menawarkan untuk memesan ulang saya, tetapi saya sudah sangat kesal sehingga menolak. Karena sudah larut malam, saya tidak bisa pindah ke hotel lain, sehingga saya harus menginap di hotel ini dua hari lagi dengan suasana hati yang tidak menyenangkan. Ini benar-benar merusak perjalanan kami ke Sanur. Jika Anda bepergian ke Bali, pastikan untuk memperhatikan sistem reservasi hotel dan tingkat layanan pelanggan. Saya tidak akan pernah menggunakannya lagi. Pengalaman hotel terburuk yang pernah saya alami. Sebulan yang lalu, saya memesan sesi spa di hotel ini untuk besok. Hari ini, saat check-in, saya pikir akan menyenangkan jika memiliki spa hari ini juga, jadi saya membuat reservasi tambahan untuk hari ini, yang dikonfirmasi oleh staf. Tetapi ketika saya tiba di spa pada waktu yang telah ditentukan, mereka memberi tahu saya bahwa tidak ada pemesanan untuk saya. Ternyata spa yang saya pesan hari ini salah dijadwalkan untuk besok, dan pemesanan awal yang saya buat sebulan lalu bahkan tidak ada di sistem mereka. Ketika saya bertanya kepada staf, mereka mengatakan terapisnya sedang cuti dan mereka tidak bisa menjadwal ulang. Saya meminta untuk berbicara dengan manajer, tetapi manajer itu juga sedang cuti dan tidak dapat dihubungi. Setelah menunggu hampir satu jam, seorang supervisor akhirnya datang — namun tidak tahu apa yang sedang terjadi, jadi kami harus menjelaskan semuanya dari awal. Pada akhirnya, mereka menawarkan untuk memesan ulang, tapi saya sudah terlalu kesal untuk menerimanya. Sudah larut malam untuk berpindah hotel, jadi sekarang kami terjebak di sini selama dua malam lagi dengan perasaan sangat tidak nyaman. Hotel ini benar-benar merusak perjalanan kami ke Sanur. Jika Anda merencanakan perjalanan ke Bali, harap berhati-hati. Sistem pemesanan dan layanan pelanggan mereka berantakan. Saya tidak akan pernah kembali ke hotel ini lagi."

Hotel menyediakan penyewaan sepeda gratis, jadi bersepeda di sepanjang pantai terasa menyenangkan. Ada supermarket dan toko-toko di dekatnya, dan Icon Bali yang baru dibuka dapat dicapai dengan berjalan kaki jika Anda nyaman berjalan kaki. Saya pasti akan menginap di sini lagi jika saya kembali ke Sanur. Namun, kualitas air kolam renangnya sepertinya perlu ditingkatkan."
"428.","leo kim","745","2025-04-09","5","Hotel butik bintang 4 ini terletak di jantung Sanur. Kualitas tempat tidurnya sangat baik, dan Contec Team Room memiliki ruang tamu di tengahnya, sehingga ideal untuk keluarga dan teman."
"429.","Taewoo Kwon","25","2025-01-09","5","Ini satu-satunya hotel bintang 4 yang saya inapi selama satu bulan di Bali. Harganya sangat terjangkau. Lokasinya tepat di sebelah supermarket. Bagian terbaiknya adalah sarapan di restoran di lantai satu. Sarapannya lebih mengenyangkan daripada hotel bintang 5 lainnya, dan saya sangat puas. Makan siang dan makan malamnya juga lezat. Kolam renangnya memang kecil, tapi saya senang. Kualitas airnya sepertinya perlu ditingkatkan."
"430.","Marina Molokanova","12","2023-01-09","5","Hotel yang luar biasa! Foto-foto di Booking.com akurat. Kamarnya bersih, bergaya, dan sangat luas (kami menginap di kamar double deluxe). Kamar mandinya besar dan nyaman, dan dibersihkan setiap hari. Bantal dan kasurnya bagus. Ada pendingin air di lantai, jadi Anda selalu bisa mengambil air. Sarapan termasuk sarapan Inggris, mi, atau nasi dengan sayuran—pilihan Anda (variasinya tidak banyak, tapi lezat). Pantai berjarak 5 menit berjalan kaki, setengahnya menyusuri jalan dan setengahnya lagi menyusuri koridor hijau di antara hotel-hotel. Pantainya bagus, tetapi Anda perlu membawa sepatu pantai untuk kerikil agar bisa masuk ke air, karena air surut sering kali berarti Anda harus berjalan di atas kerang kecil, yang bisa melukai Anda. Tidak ada handuk pantai, jadi bawalah handuk Anda sendiri. Hotel ini tidak memiliki kursi berjemur di pantai, tetapi Anda dapat bersantai di bawah pohon-pohon pantai—pohon-pohon itu memberikan keteduhan yang nyaman. Kolam renangnya bagus, dengan area relaksasi. Stafnya sangat ramah dan membantu. Setiap malam, staf hotel membawa kue bertema tradisional gratis (hal kecil, tapi menyenangkan :))"
"431.","N. G.","145","2025-01-09","5","Kamar yang indah dan luas dengan segala kenyamanan. Kami menginap dua malam di sana dan sangat menikmati kamar, tempat tidur, dan stafnya. Tempat tidurnya sangat empuk, sungguh menyenangkan! Di penghujung hari, mereka memberikan kartu berisi ramalan cuaca untuk hari berikutnya, dan setiap hari ada cokelat atau kue kering dalam keranjang di samping tempat tidur. Kolam renangnya juga fantastis, handuk disediakan, dan stafnya sangat ramah dan sopan. Kami tidak sarapan, jadi kami tidak bisa berkomentar tentang itu, tetapi jika kami ke Sanur lagi, kami pasti akan kembali!"
"432.","HIROMI","22","2025-01-09","5","Ini adalah kunjungan kedua saya dalam tujuh tahun. Sarapan tidak termasuk kali ini, jadi saya tidak makan di sana. Saya menginap di Camellia Suite, yang luas dan selalu bersih. Saya menyukai perabotan dan fasilitas lainnya yang sangat berselera. Lokasinya juga sangat strategis, tepat di pusat Sanur, dengan dua supermarket besar di dekatnya, sehingga membuat masa inap saya nyaman. Air di Bali keras, jadi orang Jepang sebaiknya membawa perawatan rambut sendiri dari Jepang atau membeli minyak rambut Ellipse di dekat hotel, kalau tidak rambut mereka akan berderit. Sampo, kondisioner, dan sabun mandi yang disediakan memiliki aroma kelapa. Meskipun hotel ini tidak berada di pantai, jaraknya hanya 10 menit berjalan kaki. Kolam renang hotel kecil dan sering kali berada di tempat teduh, jadi sepertinya tidak banyak orang yang menggunakannya."
"433.","박재성","40","2025-01-09","4","Kami menginap di sini selama tiga malam. Secara keseluruhan, hotel ini memiliki suasana yang nyaman. Hotel ini memiliki kolam renang kecil, pusat kebugaran, dan restoran. Meskipun kami tiba setelah tengah malam dengan penerbangan semalam, proses check-in berjalan lancar. Tipe kamarnya adalah Camellia Suite, kamar yang sedikit lebih besar daripada kamar deluxe standar, dilengkapi sofa dan tempat tidur king. Sebagai keluarga beranggotakan tiga orang, kami bisa tidur nyenyak tanpa perlu tempat tidur tambahan. Namun, kulkas di kamar tidak memiliki penukar panas, jadi tidak memenuhi standar kami. Restoran di sini tampaknya cukup bagus. Ini bukan prasmanan, melainkan menu set di mana Anda dapat memilih dari berbagai hidangan. Hidangan khas hotel (berlabel Hidangan Utama) sangat lezat. Saya merekomendasikan latte. Staf selalu menyambut kami dengan senyuman. Mereka segera menanggapi permintaan kami dan tampaknya selalu memastikan jalur kami bersih. Interior hotel, dengan gaya Eropanya, dihiasi dengan foto-foto dan karya seni Indonesia kuno. Saya merasa cukup menawan. Hotel ini terletak di jantung kawasan pusat kota Sanur yang ramai, dengan jalan yang membentang dari utara ke selatan, dan dikelilingi oleh banyak toko bergaya Bali. Lokasinya yang strategis, tepat di sebelah supermarket besar, menjadikannya tempat yang mudah untuk menemukan kebutuhan sehari-hari (alkohol, rokok, mungkin). Secara keseluruhan, hotel ini tampak bagus dan sangat direkomendasikan."
"434.","Jessica Leheis","10","2025-01-09","5","Hotel yang fantastis dan bergaya tepat di jantung Sanur. Kami memesan kamar keluarga, yang berarti dua kamar tidur dengan ruang tamu kecil. Pelayanan dan keramahan stafnya luar biasa. Dari sambutan (handuk bersih dan minuman selamat datang) hingga menjawab pertanyaan dan mengucapkan selamat tinggal: semuanya sungguh luar biasa. Kami tiba lebih awal dan kamar kami belum siap. Sementara bagasi kami disimpan di hotel, kami dapat berjalan-jalan di kota dan diberi tahu melalui WhatsApp bahwa kamar kami sudah siap dan bagasi kami sudah diantar ke sana. Karena kami harus pergi pagi-pagi sekali, kotak makan siang yang besar disiapkan untuk kami, karena kami tidak bisa sarapan. Karena kami hanya menginap dua malam, sayangnya kami tidak sempat menggunakan kolam renang dan fasilitas lainnya. Namun, kami sangat merekomendasikan hotel ini dan akan kembali kapan saja!"

Fasilitasnya luar biasa, dan tempat tidur serta fasilitasnya luas, bersih, dan nyaman. Dan pastikan untuk mencoba sarapannya. Mereka menawarkan berbagai pilihan a la carte. Anda tidak perlu pergi ke kafe brunch. Semuanya lezat. Panti pijat hotel juga terjangkau, yang merupakan hal yang menyenangkan. Anggota mendapatkan diskon 15%. Petugas keamanan selalu menyambut Anda dengan ramah dan membukakan pintu, dan stafnya umumnya sangat membantu. Manajer berkeliling di setiap sudut hotel, memperhatikan setiap detail dengan saksama. Tempat ini bahkan dikenal oleh penduduk setempat, menyelenggarakan pesta ulang tahun dan acara minum anggur. Saya sangat merekomendasikannya. P.S. Aku meninggalkan tiga tip, tapi mereka tidak mengambilnya. ㅜㅠ Aku sangat berterima kasih, tapi..."

Ada goresan di furnitur dan dinding, serta noda di bantal sofa. Meskipun hal ini dapat dimaklumi, noda di seprai dan rambut di lantai mengganggu saya, jadi saya menurunkan skor kebersihan kamar. Namun, semua staf sangat ramah, dan dispenser air di lorong, yang sangat nyaman bagi kami, memungkinkan kami untuk minum air mineral kapan saja. Mengingat musim sepi dan harga di Bali, mungkin harganya bisa sedikit lebih murah? Namun, dengan banyaknya supermarket dan restoran di dekatnya serta lokasi yang strategis, saya mengerti bahwa ini adalah harga properti. Terima kasih atas pengalaman menginap yang menyenangkan."

Sarapan sudah termasuk, akan lebih baik jika harganya tidak terlalu berbeda. Hotel ini semi-prasmanan dengan satu menu a la carte, yang merupakan sarapan cepat dan lezat. Lokasinya strategis, dengan supermarket besar tepat di sebelahnya, sehingga mudah untuk membeli air dan buah. Ada juga ATM di sebelah supermarket, yang praktis untuk tarik tunai. Ada kafe dan restoran yang bagus di dekatnya, dan di seberang jalan ada Koashala dan sebuah panti pijat yang baru dibuka."
"439.","Michele","435","2018-01-09","5","Berlokasi strategis di Denpasar, ibu kota Bali, kami menghabiskan sebagian besar bulan madu kami yang indah di Maison Aurelia. Staf menyambut kami dan melakukan ritual singkat untuk keberuntungan, memberi kami gelang dan meletakkan beras di dahi kami. Setibanya di kamar, kami melihat beberapa dekorasi bertema pengantin baru yang indah, yang membuat kami sangat senang! Kamarnya nyaman dan sangat bersih, dan kamar mandinya dilengkapi dengan semua yang kami butuhkan, termasuk sikat gigi, pasta gigi, perlengkapan mandi, dan sandal. Selain restoran dan bar, hotel ini juga memiliki spa (ulasan terpisah) yang memberikan pengalaman yang sama positifnya. Hotel ini menawarkan dua kolam renang, satu dengan pusaran air dan satu tanpa pusaran air. Kolam renangnya tidak besar, tetapi indah, terawat rapi, dan bersih. Di malam hari, kolam renang ini sangat indah, dan di siang hari, kolam renang ini menawarkan kesejukan yang menyegarkan dari panasnya iklim khatulistiwa di pulau ini. Sarapan yang termasuk dalam menginap semalam adalah sarapan kontinental, jadi Anda tidak perlu berharap banyak—hanya jus, teh/kopi, buah, panekuk, kue kering, dan sejenisnya. Tentu saja cukup untuk mengisi perut Anda, tetapi jika Anda, seperti kami, berencana menginap beberapa hari, ketahuilah bahwa di hari ketiga Anda sudah akan mencoba semua menu sarapan yang ditawarkan. Untuk makan siang, kami selalu makan di luar, dan untuk makan malam, kami bergantian di salah satu dari banyak restoran yang berjejer di sepanjang jalan, dan kami selalu bersenang-senang. Maison Aurelia menawarkan pengalaman yang sebagian besar positif yang akan kami rekomendasikan kepada siapa pun yang berencana menginap di Bali."

Itu sesuatu yang belum pernah saya alami di tempat lain. Saya bertanya-tanya apakah kulkasnya berfungsi, atau hanya dirancang sebagai dapur untuk menyimpan makanan. Saya ingat seorang pemandu lokal mengatakan bahwa rumah-rumah di Bali tidak memiliki kulkas, dan saya tidak menyadari bahwa bahkan hotel pun tidak menganggap kulkas di dalam kamar diperlukan."

Ini hotel yang sangat terjangkau! 🤭 Hanya satu kekurangannya... kalau Anda penggemar kebugaran seperti saya, gym-nya agak kecil, yang bisa mengecewakan.

"456.","Traveler","211","2024-01-09","3","Stafnya ramah, terutama pria yang lebih tua dengan rambut pendek dan sikap yang menyenangkan. Jika bukan karena dia, mungkin saya tidak akan memperpanjang masa inap saya selama seminggu. Satpamnya juga sangat ramah. Kamar-kamarnya bersih, dengan tekanan air yang kuat, banyak handuk, dan staf hotel membersihkan setelah setiap masa inap, bahkan menyediakan camilan dan informasi cuaca yang detail. Supermarket, restoran, pantai, tempat penyewaan mobil, dan tempat laundry di dekatnya semuanya bagus. Sikap, pelayanan, dan makanan dari staf restoran di lantai pertama semuanya sangat baik. Satu-satunya kekurangan sangat mengganggu sehingga saya ingin memberikannya satu bintang: 1. Kulkas masih berantakan saat saya check-in, dan saya akhirnya terkena gastroenteritis karenanya. 2. Resepsionis pria berkacamata sangat kasar, dan berbicara dengannya selalu membuat saya kesal. 3. AC kulkasnya sangat lemah sehingga, ketika bayi saya sakit, saya mengemas makanan dan barang-barang lain untuk disimpan, tetapi makanan itu cepat busuk dan akhirnya saya buang. Awalnya, saya pikir itu masalah dengan restoran atau toko, tetapi memikirkan semua barang yang telah saya buang membuat saya frustrasi. Tentu saja, saya makan sedikit makanan setiap minggu dan membuangnya, jadi saat ini saya terbaring di tempat tidur karena gastroenteritis. Tolong, beli kulkas yang lebih baik. Saya belum bisa keluar rumah selama seminggu dan terjebak di kamar saya. 5. Ada masalah kebersihan di sini. Kami menginap selama dua minggu, jadi kami seharusnya membersihkan setiap dua atau tiga hari. Tetapi suatu hari, ada banyak semut kecil, jadi saya meminta mereka untuk mengganti seprai. Ketika saya kembali, seprainya masih sama, dan mereka menatanya seolah-olah sudah diganti. Ketika saya bertanya apakah mereka sudah menggantinya, mereka dengan bangga mengatakan sudah. ​​Padahal jelas bagi siapa pun bahwa mereka belum menggantinya. Para petugas kebersihan selalu masuk dengan sepatu mereka dan kemudian menggantinya. Saya bertelanjang kaki, dan staf lantai pertama serta petugas kebersihan masuk dengan sepatu mereka. Jadi, ketika saya mengepel lantai, lantainya menjadi hitam. Saya kehilangan semua poin saya karena para petugas kebersihan."

Itu bukan pembersihan, dan saya masih tidak mengerti apa yang mereka inginkan di kamar saya. Saya bisa saja telanjang atau melakukan hal lain dengan istri saya. Tidak ada privasi; staf akan masuk begitu saja tanpa alasan. Saya sarankan untuk mengunci pintu dengan gerendel setiap kali. Ketika kami menghubungi resepsionis tentang insiden ini, mereka tidak membantu kami; mereka hanya membuat alasan dan menyarankan kami untuk memasang tanda di pintu. Namun staf tidak pernah menyelesaikan masalah tersebut. Jadi, berhati-hatilah."

Lobinya sendiri sangat menarik, dan karya seninya dipajang dan dijual, layaknya sebuah galeri. Semua kamar merupakan suite dengan dekorasi bergaya Eropa dan teras yang luas. Bahkan kamar yang paling sederhana pun sangat memuaskan. Kekurangannya, kolam renangnya agak kecil... tetapi karena tidak ada tamu, saya bisa menikmati sore yang lebih privat. Kelebihan lainnya adalah Hardys Mall berada tepat di sebelahnya, sehingga sangat nyaman untuk berbelanja dan berwisata (titik pertemuan Klook). Saya pasti akan berkunjung lagi."
"464.","Rui Filipe Da Cunha Alves","71","2020-01-09","2","Pengalaman buruk; suasana modern, dengan nuansa mewah, mengecewakan untuk hotel sekelas ini. Harganya sungguh tidak sepadan. Pertama, bau apak dan tua di suite, mungkin berasal dari sofa dan karpet. Namun, tempat tidurnya bersih dan nyaman. Relatif bersih. Ada sarang laba-laba, dengan banyak laba-laba. Mengenai sarapan, tidak banyak, dan yang sedikit pun rasanya tidak terlalu enak. Stafnya tidak terlalu ramah; mereka bahkan tidak menanyakan bagaimana pengalaman menginap kami, tetapi mereka tidak ragu untuk meminta sumbangan amal."
"465.","B&K","7","2023-01-09","5","Luar biasa 😊. Hotelnya bersih dan modern. Kamar kami adalah kamar keluarga dengan dua kamar tidur, persis seperti di foto. Aroma yang menyenangkan menyambut kami saat memasuki hotel, stafnya ramah, dan ada restoran di dekatnya yang menyajikan hidangan lezat. …"
"466.","リん","93","2019-01-09","5","Lokasinya di jantung Jalan Tamblingan, sehingga mudah untuk berkeliling. Terdapat restoran dan kafe tepat di depan hotel. Terdapat supermarket Hardy's yang buka hingga larut malam, dan minimarket di dekatnya, sehingga Anda dapat berbelanja dengan cepat. Hotel dan kamarnya tidak bernuansa Bali, tetapi luas. Terdapat juga spa. Terdapat kolam renang, tetapi karena berada di tengah gedung, sepertinya tidak banyak terkena sinar matahari, tergantung waktu. Terdapat dua AC di dalam kamar, sehingga nyaman. Terdapat kulkas, tetapi suhunya hampir tidak dingin. Shower-nya memiliki pasokan air panas yang stabil. Tidak ada bathtub. Merokok tidak diperbolehkan di dalam kamar, tetapi Anda dapat merokok di teras, tetapi harap diperhatikan bahwa tidak tersedia asbak."
"467.","Marika Belfiori","54","2019-01-09","4","Agen perjalanan kami menyarankan kami menginap di sini selama satu malam untuk bulan madu kami sebelum berangkat ke Nusa Lembongan. Ini adalah hotel butik yang luar biasa, dengan staf yang ramah dan membantu yang menyambut kami dengan gestur tradisional Babilonia: bunga frangipani di rambut kami, gelang keberuntungan, dan beras di dahi kami. Kamar-kamarnya ditata dengan selera tinggi dalam gaya modern dan elegan, memungkinkan detail-detail tertentu mencerminkan tradisi Bali. Satu-satunya alasan saya tidak memberikan lima bintang adalah karena lokasinya berada di jalan internal dan tidak langsung di tepi laut, jika tidak, hotel ini akan benar-benar sempurna. Laut hanya berjarak tujuh menit berjalan kaki. Saya juga berkesempatan menggunakan spa, memanjakan diri dengan pijat Bali yang menenangkan dan menyegarkan. Begitu Anda melangkah masuk, yang perlu Anda lakukan hanyalah membiarkan diri Anda dimanjakan."

"470.","Michi Schaaf (Michis_Wanderlust)","210","2019-01-09","5","Berlokasi sentral, berperabotan modern, dan nyaman... Kami menginap empat malam di hotel ini. Setelah sambutan hangat dan minuman selamat datang, kami langsung menuju kamar kami yang sangat modern, luas, dan bersih. Stafnya sangat ramah dan membantu. Reservasi restoran atau perjalanan sehari pun mudah. ​​Proses check-in dan check-out juga cepat. Sarapan dapat diatur sesuai selera Anda. à la carte dengan pilihan di muka. Sarapan dimulai pukul 19.00. Jika Anda membutuhkan sesuatu lebih awal, paket sarapan juga dapat disiapkan. Hotel ini berlokasi sangat sentral, tepat di pinggir jalan dengan restoran dan bar. Anda dapat mendengarkan musik live di malam hari di hotel di seberang jalan, tetapi setelah pukul 22.00, suasana Sanur yang ramah keluarga menjadi lebih tenang. Saya akan kembali menginap di Maison Aurelia. Hotel yang benar-benar luar biasa."

Sarapannya bukan prasmanan, melainkan paket makanan dengan dua atau tiga pilihan: salad, hidangan utama, dan jus. Awalnya terasa aneh, tetapi ternyata enak. Supermarket Hardy's terletak strategis di sebelahnya, dan Pantai Sanur dapat dicapai dengan berjalan kaki lima menit. Suasana siang hari tenang, dan suasana malam hari sangat menyenangkan dengan musik live yang diputar sepanjang malam. Kepuasan 90%."

Saya tidak memesan sarapan, jadi saya tidak perlu pergi ke restoran, tapi di hari terakhir, saya memesan makan malam di restoran dan menunggu. Lalu, seorang pria Barat yang berkeringat mengenakan kaus berjalan keluar masuk dapur sambil membawa kantong kertas. Saya perhatikan dengan saksama dan ternyata dia sedang memasak; Dia tidak memakai masker, bahkan tidak memakai celemek seragam atau semacamnya. Saya tidak percaya. Perut saya mual dan saya tidak bisa makan."
"483.","hunter J (foodhunter)","418","2024-01-09","3","Hotel ini tidak sebagus hotel bintang 5. Kolam renangnya hanya memiliki 4 kursi berjemur.

Lokasinya di jantung Sanur, tetapi agak jauh dari pantai (cukup ambil Jalan Maya)."
