Every single staff we met (and we met a lot) is friendly, kind, efficient and very quick to deal with all and many requests without any trouble. Lived like a true home away from home, loved the crisp interior, greatly appreciated room upgrade, microwaves to warm up grab food, no fuss and hassle pickup/ drop off laundry. Fixed safe box very quickly. Fantastic veggie break fast box for our day trips. 🥳 so satisfying Will definitely be back!! Loved it 🥰"
"2.","Troy L","97","2025-12-31","5","Locates right smack in the northern end of Malioboro and 10-min walk from the train station; best location. Only 15-min walk from the legend Mbah Satinem; must visit her if you're in Yogyakarta, her breakfast is truly good!. Plaza Malioboro shopping center next door got some pretty good local foods too. The bathroom sliding door is odd but room services were great. Pool area drinks and foods are expensive, be prepared to pay-up. We received a check-out gifts (portable coffee jug and other things) which was a surprise (for a wk stay??); never received any gifts from any hotels that I've stayed at (none from Westin, Marriott, Ritz, or Hilton). Thumbs-up for the experiences. Yogyakarta is awesome!"
"3.","MimS Mohamed","33","2025-12-31","4","Location was great in the middle of Malioboro and near supermarket as well as eateries. Service by Lulu at reception was exceptional. There were downsides though like clogged sink that took sometime before it cleared, constant ants around the pantry, stains that are not cleaned out from the fridge & worse of all, the several power trips while we were in the room. 2 out of 3 rooms that were booked experienced this at night. Not pleasant for a 4 star hotel & price point. Otherwise, hotel in general was great."
"4.","Stanislas Cindy","8","2025-12-07","5","I had a great experience at Novotel! The cocktails were absolutely delicious!!! 🥰🥰perfectly balanced and refreshing. The service was excellent, especially from Andre, who was very friendly and attentive. He made sure everything was perfect and made me feel really welcome. Definitely one of the best hotel bars I’ve been to. Highly recommended!"
"5.","sarah salim","4","2025-12-24","2","Untuk bintang 4 agak mengecewakan : 1. Masuk lift banyak stain di dinding lift. 2. Lift terbuka lgsg tercium bau apek aneh saat baru menuju kamar. 3. Kamar kurang di maintain dengan baik, wallpaper banyak yg terkelupas dan tidak diperbaiki, karpet ada bercak kotor seperti dibiarkan, masuk kamar mandi di area shower banyak stain kuning dan bau apek lembab, tidak ada cottonbud, tidak ada laundry bag dan tempat soap bar. 4. Saat complain soal kulkas tdk dingin ke bagian guest service mrk bilang akan send tehnisi ke kamar untuk mengecek, tapi ditunggu 1 jam tidak ada yang datang.. saat langsung lapor ke reception mereka bilang kulkas memang hanya display saja memang tidak dingin 😂 lalu apabila saya beli makan atau minum dari luar bisa titip di staff hotel, jujur baru pertama saya dengar komen semacam itu, aneh! 5. Bfast menu kurang variatif, rasanya jg perlu di tingkatkan, butter display dlm keadaan terbuka, dan tdk ada penutup, agak aneh. Tingkatkan kebersihan dan kualitas menu makanan anda, untuk hotel bintang 4 menurut saya kurang layak, anda bisa kalah bersaing kalau tidak ada perubahan, Terimakasih"
"6.","Avivah Yamani","2","2025-12-07","5","Best experience in Yogya. Love the room and service. Breakfast is really good with many traditional food from Jogja. It’s delicious. Love jamu as well. And I really love the microwave in room. The view from the rooftop for sunrise is amazing, the cafe in the rooftop is good as well. Thanks to all the front office for your help also the restaurant staff."
"7.","Vera Veganz","17","2025-11-07","5","I am having a wonderful stay at Novotel Suites Yogyakarta. My positive experience began even before arrival, when Assistant Reservation Manager Fitriani promptly responded to my email and ensured that my non-smoking preference and breakfast arrangements were well noted. It was clear she had communicated my requirements across departments. At check-in, the front desk staff were warm and attentive, and I was pleasantly surprised by a thoughtful welcome gift from the General Manager—a selection that perfectly reflected my plant-based lifestyle. In the restaurant, Reza and the team were equally professional and well-briefed, offering plant-based milk and checking if I needed anything customised. Overall, my stay was seamless and genuinely enjoyable. Compliments to the General Manager for leading a team that clearly takes pride in delivering outstanding service."
"8.","count ocnop","29","2025-11-07","5","I was personally very satisfied with the service from all departments from the Front Office, F&B, to the Pool team you were all great! Beside, your choice of music on the pool & bar very good and jazzy🎷🎷 We received such a warm welcome, and even though we didn’t use it, the hotel kindly offered us an early check-in, which was very much appreciated🙏🏻 The food was also wonderful. As a former Quality Assurance professional from one of the biggest hotel chains, I can confidently say — you are verified! 👌🏻👌🏻 The complimentary cake and beautifully folded towels touched my heart. Such a personal gesture made our stay even more special. One of the most memorable moments was riding the hotel’s bicycles at night to Malioboro and it was complimentary! Truly an unforgettable experience. Furthermore, I also considering to apply accor membership due to affected by your corporates value and respecting the spirit of loving the mother nature. Your partnership with WWF even grows my will even more due to I am a MONA from WWF🐼 From the bottom of my heart, thank you so much. I will definitely stay here again whenever I’m in Yogyakarta, and I will surely recommend this hotel to my colleagues and family❤️"
"9.","Fitria Purbowati","24","2025-10-07","4","The location was good, walking distance to Malioboro. Check in process was quite straight forward. Laundry service was quite fast. We put our laundry around 1pm and it was done in the morning. Even though it was around 1 hour late than it was promised and we needed to call for our laundry to be delivered. The information about the closing time for the pool area was not given clearly enough though. The pool staff and the reception said different hours so, we missed the chance to swim since we only stayed for 1 night and needed to check out early the next day. The room was nice. The bed was spacious and comfortable. The hairdryer might need an upgrade to a better one so, it'll dry hair quicker."
"10.","H S","7","2025-11-07","5","This is my first time to stay at novotel jogja and had a positive experience. The location is convenient for myself as it is located very near to Malioboro street and nearby amenities. The hotes is clean, well organised and well presented. I find the staff very accomodating and helpful. A special thanks to receptionis the guy who handle me for request the room with city view before the check in time and i keep my luggage at concierge. sorry i forgot his name who always friendly and approachable. Thank you"
"11.","Yaling Merry","1","2025-12-07","5","Pengalaman berenang di 10/10 Pool and Bar – Novotel Suites Yogyakarta benar-benar luar biasa! 🌊✨ Kolamnya bersih, nyaman, dan pemandangannya indah banget—tempat yang pas untuk bersantai sambil menikmati suasana Jogja dari ketinggian. Yang paling berkesan adalah pelayanan dari staff-nya. Terima kasih banyak untuk Mas Andre, Mas Erlang, dan Mas Tovany yang sangat ramah, sigap, dan profesional.

Pasti bakal balik lagi ke sini! 💙"
"12.","APRIUS RONALD","130","2026-01-01","5","Sebenarnya tidak menginap di novotel tetapi masuk ke Krisna Jogjakarta. Informasinya baru buka 2 tahun. Ada pie krisna dan Bakpia krisna buat yang kangen oleh2 atau rasa dari kedua makanan tersebut. Ada juga berbagai macam oleh2. Jika ke jogja mungkin lebih baik prepare ke krisna buat beli oleh2. Mantap."
"13.","petra kaisar","1","2025-12-17","5","Thank you for this opportunity I can come to Novotel Malioboro Yogyakarta. And thank you to Erlang for your excellent service. As a guest, I appreciate that and it's a value that can't be repaid with anything. I like it Sop Buntut, It feels warm when you enjoy it with the sunset on the rooftop. I can to forgetting that. Thank you again to the Novotel Malioboro Yogyakarta team. This is the best and really really worth it !!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
"14.","sari dilts","4","2025-11-07","5","The service from all the staff (especially Ms. Kiki) was also wonderful—everyone was so friendly and made us feel very comfortable during our stay.

"17.","Ui Suryo","7","2025-11-07","5","I’ve stayed at Novotel Suites many times, yet there’s always something new that surprises me. Pak Aris, ever so attentive, welcomed my husband and me warmly. He made sure I didn’t have to bother with parking and kindly helped us with our luggage. At breakfast, Nezar was incredibly friendly — he made sure I got a perfect cup of coffee by preparing a manual hot cappuccino just for me. Later, while I was chilling at the cozy pool bar, Andre the barista made me a special and delicious drink using the passion fruit I brought. Another thing I love about the pool bar here is the beautiful outdoor sound system and the great choice of music — perfect to enjoy while sipping a cocktail or simply relaxing after a long day."

"19.","Emilliano Indra","47","2025-11-07","5","Afterall these years, still the best hotel in yogyakarta. Always stayed at this hotel every year we went to yogya.I have already writen some reviews about how great this hotel inside outside were, but this time tops them all. Front desk mas deli and mas arieq were attentive, polite and taking care of our family, and Pak Yudha was the best. He really went above and beyond to make us felt at home. Thank you sir, and thank you novotel for making our trip always the one to remember"

Yang ke 2 saya cobain mojito coffee, rasanya unik tapi balance, enak nagih sampe 2 gelas. Thank u mas Andre, desember saya ke yogya lagi mau mampir ke poolbar lagi"

Berkunjung bersama anak-anak yg kebetulan mencari playground indoor tp tidak tersedia namun adanya playground outdoor lumayan berkesan untuk anak-anak. Kolam renang di rooftop bersih dan ada kolam renang anak yg juga bersih."
"23.","henry limargo","24","2025-11-07","5","Very good service despite its being a very busy hotel in the middle of Malioboro Street. The room is well maintained, and the service response is very quick. Our daughter left her sunglasses in the room, and the service team quickly resolved the issue by sending back the sunglasses to our house address. Thanks a lot to Mr Farhan for the help assisting this issue. Definitely will be back."
"24.","Yuliana Rinda","1","2025-10-07","5","Novotel Suites Yogyakarta tempat menginap yang nyaman di pusat kota Jogja, hanya beberapa langkah dari kawasan Malioboro. Kamar luas, bersih, dengan desain modern yang membuat istirahat lebih tenang. Fasilitas yang tersedia cukup lengkap mulai dari kolam renang rooftop dengan pemandangan kota, gym, spa, hingga restoran dengan menu variatif. Pelayanan staf hangat dan profesional. Meski suasana sekitar kadang cukup ramai, dan pilihan sarapan masih bisa lebih beragam, hotel ini tetap menjadi pilihan ideal untuk wisatawan maupun pebisnis yang mencari kenyamanan hotel berbintang dengan lokasi strategis."
"25.","Gervasius Sudarto","1","2025-12-17","5","Oke fix saya masukin ke list salah 1 bar keren di jogja, dari pelayanan, makanan, minuman nggak ada yang gagal. Big thank buat mas andre, mas upay, dan mas fauzi. Saya pesan 2 cocktail yang berbeda enak semua, makan soup buntut dan piza. Next kalau ke jogja saya pasti ke sini lagi. See u next year"
"26.","Willie Tan","82","2025-10-07","5","Novotel Suites Yogyakarta Malioboro is easily one of the best places to stay in the city. Rooms & Facilities The rooms are impressively spacious and well-equipped. I was pleasantly surprised to find a microwave in the room—a rare convenience in most hotels. Everything felt modern and comfortable, making it a great base for both short and longer stays. Service & Staff The staff here are consistently warm, attentive, and friendly. Their hospitality really stands out and makes the stay feel personal and welcoming. Location The hotel sits right in the heart of Malioboro, one of Yogyakarta’s cultural and shopping hubs. It’s perfect if you want easy access to local attractions, shops, and food. Amenities The spa is excellent—affordable and good quality, a great way to relax after exploring. On the flip side, the gym was underwhelming: small and with very limited equipment, especially for strength training. This was the only real disappointment in terms of facilities. Food & Dining Breakfast leaned heavily on local flavors, which I enjoyed. There was a good variety and no real issues with the food experience overall. Overall Impression Despite the small gym, my overall experience at Novotel Suites Malioboro was fantastic. Spacious rooms, thoughtful amenities, friendly staff, and a prime location make this hotel a standout choice in Yogyakarta."
"27.","Novita Dewi","6","2025-12-07","5","Overall very satisfying.. Thanks to mba Lasmi to upgrade my room as a platinum member of Accor. And thanks mas Delly to handle me so well when i late cek in coz my flight got delayed. Tapi sedih bgt krn bsk saya ada flight ke jogja, sayangnya saya kehabisan kamar utk bsk 🥲"
"28.","Dumptroop Kakiye","7","2025-12-07","5","Lokasi yang strategis untuk memulai aktifitas di yogyakarta. Harga yang sesuai untuk kamar yg cukup luas lengkap dengan sofa santai dan pantry. Beraneka ragam menu breakfast dengan rasa yang enak serta smoking areanya yang nyaman. Saya akan selalu menginap di sini ketika ke Yogyakarta"
"29.","Muhammad Bisri","7","2025-10-07","2","Kemarin menginap di Novotel Suites untuk acara family gathering perusahaan. Kesan pertama datang, pelayanan sudah mengecewakan. Kami tiba di hotel pukul 15.30, artinya sudah melebihi jam check in, tapi saat akan check in, ternyata beberapa kamar belum ready entah apa alasannya, sehingga saya dan rombongan harus menunggu sampai pukul 16.30. Padahal kami sudah melakukan booking kamar jauh2 hari dan sudah melakukan pembayaran. Untuk sekelas hotel bintang 4, saya rasa ini sangat tidak profesional. Untuk lokasi sangat strategis, dekat dengan malioboro & pusat keramaian. Untuk kamar, kebetulan kamar yang saya tempati, exhaust fan untuk toilet tidak berfungsi, juga kran shower bocor. Semoga kedepannya pelayanan terkait front office bisa lebih baik lagi."
"30.","Myrthe Horst","14","2025-08-07","4","We chose this hotel based on its high rating on Google, so we had fairly high expectations. While some things lived up to them, not everything met what we had hoped for. The staff were friendly, though not always very helpful. We stayed on the 7th floor and were unfortunately woken up every morning by the nearby mosque — which was quite disruptive. The room itself was spacious and the shower was good. However, when we arrived, the towels and cups were dirty. This was resolved quickly once we reported it. There’s a small kitchenette in the room, but since there are no plates or cutlery provided, it’s not really practical to prepare your own meals. The beds are on the firmer side — not as comfortable as those in the Marriott chain, but if you prefer a harder mattress, they’ll suit you just fine. We had breakfast at the hotel one morning. The Western options were okay, but nothing standout. Overall, a good stay with some areas for improvement."
"31.","yokiansyah","7","2025-12-07","5","I really enjoyed my stay at Novotel Suites Yogyakarta Malioboro.

"33.","Rivai","323","2025-11-07","5","This accomodation suits to anyone who wants to stay for vacation and business in Yogyakarta. The location is very close to Malioboro street and Yogyakarta train station. The staffs are so friendly and their service is just excellent. This hotel offers breakfast with various local food and plenty options for fresh foods."
"34.","Yogi Sanjaya","2","2025-12-07","5","Saya sudah 6 kali berkunjung ke 10/10 poolbar, selalu nyobain cocktail baru, nggak ada yang gagal semua masuk di lidah saya, yang bikin seperti biasa head barnya langsung mas andre namanya, selalu ada taste baru buat saya kalau saya berkunjung ke bar. Kali ini ada mas tovani dan mas erlang juga yang ramah. Next bakal di kejutkan dengan cocktail apa lagi sama mas andre kalau ke jogja lagi. Sampai ketemu di bulan januari mas andre dan team! Tujuan wajib kalau ke joga!"
"35.","Abdur Rahman","49","2025-11-07","5","I stayed and held my event using the ballroom at Novotel Suites Malioboro. Mba Dinda from the front office was very friendly and helpful during the check-in process. Many thanks to mba Ayuika from the sales department, who was very supportive in handling the needs of my event and meeting. She was also very fast in responding to my questions during the event preparation. I would also like to thank the entire banquet team for their excellent and fast response to all needs inside the meeting room."

"42.","Shubham Gupta","14","2025-08-07","5","Absolutely amazing experience! The food was not only delicious but also thoughtfully prepared. What truly sets this place apart is the exceptional staff and service — warm, attentive, and incredibly accommodating. One of the highlights is their willingness to customize meals based on your dietary preferences or restrictions, which is a rare find in Yogyakarta. Whether you’re vegan, gluten-free, or have specific requirements, they go the extra mile to make sure you’re taken care of without compromising on taste or presentation. Highly recommended!"

"55.","Morrison Tri","7","2025-07-07","4","Lokasi strategis tinggal jalan kaki udh malioboro, mas receptionist ramah saat cek in minta room yg ada viewnya tidak menghadap tembok bisa di carikan view hadap jalan mataram, lumayanlah. Padahal sblmny via telp request sm mba receptionis view jln mataram ktny tdk ada, adanya hadap tembok semua, kecuali tipe executive dpt view bagus..sedikit kecewa sm mbanya...utk makanan menginap selama 4hari banyak macamnya tapi kurang variasi, menu itu aja..cleaning service tergolong lambat minta dibersihkan dr jam 8 sampe jam 2 blm dibersihkan, hari berikutny jg demikian..but ok bs dimaklumi krn lg rame liburan, kamar kurang kedap suara sangat berisik pembicaraan dr lorong maupun kmr sebelah terdengar apalagi yg bw anak kecil gaduhnya sangat mengganggu sekali, room bersih,luas nyaman hny blm smartTV meskipun tvmya 55 kolam renang sangat baguuus,bersih, tempat gym juga ok. Satu lagi yg bikin kita kaget waktu mau turun lift, ada OB yg bw troli barang segede gaban full tas/barang, mengatur kita utk menepi kekiri dan memaksa masuk lift pdhl kita udh bertiga masuk lift duluan, harusnya utamakan guest terlebih dulu apalagi liftnya sempit, kita merasa tidak nyaman ajaa.. Overall is Good ! Terimakasih Novotel udah jadi tempat singgah kami selama liburan di Jogja kali ini...🙏😊"

"61.","Dr Sanjay Khanna","12","2025-09-07","5","An Exceptional Stay in the Heart of the City From the moment we arrived, we were struck by the courtesy and warmth of the staff. Their gracious hospitality made us feel truly welcome. The room was impeccably appointed, offering every comfort one could wish for. The location could not be more ideal—nestled close to everything, including the train station, yet blissfully removed from the noise and bustle. Iconic Marlboro Street lies less than a hundred metres away, inviting you to immerse yourself in the charm of local markets and the vibrant Javanese street culture. Breakfast was a delightful highlight, offering a sumptuous spread that seamlessly combined continental favourites with authentic Indonesian and Javanese specialities. The traditional herbal drinks were a particularly enjoyable discovery. A thoughtful and touching gesture from the breakfast team was preparing a special serving of fried rice for my vegetarian wife, which we deeply appreciated. I have already recommended this hotel to my children for their future visit—it is truly a place worth experiencing. Ratings: Location: 10/10 Staff: 10/10 Rooms: 10/10 Breakfast: 12/10 (and I mean it) Wi-Fi: 10/10 Facilities: 10/10 Dr Khanna Room No 521 Checkout 13 August 2025 Menginap yang Istimewa di Jantung Kota Sejak tiba, kami langsung terkesan dengan keramahan dan kehangatan staf. Keramahan mereka yang luar biasa membuat kami merasa benar-benar diterima. Kamarnya ditata dengan sempurna, menawarkan segala kenyamanan yang diinginkan. Lokasinya sungguh ideal—dekat dengan segalanya, termasuk stasiun kereta, namun jauh dari kebisingan dan hiruk pikuk. Jalan Marlboro yang ikonis terletak kurang dari seratus meter, mengundang Anda untuk menikmati pesona pasar lokal dan budaya jalanan Jawa yang semarak. Sarapan menjadi sorotan yang menyenangkan, menawarkan hidangan mewah yang memadukan hidangan favorit kontinental dengan hidangan khas Indonesia dan Jawa yang autentik. Minuman herbal tradisional juga menjadi sajian yang sangat menyenangkan. Kebaikan dan keramahan dari tim sarapan adalah menyiapkan nasi goreng spesial untuk istri saya yang vegetarian, yang sangat kami hargai. Saya telah merekomendasikan hotel ini kepada anak-anak saya untuk kunjungan mereka berikutnya—sungguh tempat yang layak untuk dikunjungi.

Still felt very much welcomed by the staff and the hotel remained one of the best. Enjoyed the friendliness and professionalism of the staff, they knew my travel companion and myself by name upon arrival in the hotel. They really managed to personalise my stay. Nothing was too much to ask, they even asked me halfway through my stay if we needed anything else. Because of my Platinum status, I got upgraded to a better room, which was great. Breakfast, pool and the 1010 bar remains great as well! Thanks to the whole team of FO, F&B and housekeeping."
"63.","Erna Rokhayati","6","2025-10-07","5","Had a good overnight stay in Novotel Suites Malioboro. It's proximity to the train station was the main reason for the stay as I needed to catch the early train. The staffs were welcoming and helpful. I was upgraded to a Junior Suite room as part of my gold status of Accor member. The room itself was clean and comfortable and everything worked well. The front office staff was very accommodating to provide takeaway breakfast for me as I checked out at 5.30 am. It consists of nasi goreng, fruits and beverages which was nice. Overall, recommended and would return."

"67.","Kenneth Foster","2","2025-09-07","5","Spent ten amazing days (July-August 2025) on holiday in Yogyakarta with my wife staying at the Novotel Suites in Malioboro. Great location being right next to Malioboro Street where all the fun activity is and it’s a good central location from which to holiday and explore. The hotel was fantastic, our room was very comfortable and clean. There is nothing I can think of that wasn’t catered for, we wanted for nothing. The restaurant where we had breakfast each day was very comfortable and had a wide selection of food that catered to all tastes. There is a very nice roof top pool where the 10/10 Pool Bar is, which also caters for meals. It had a pleasant view, with the lights at night adding to the ambience. It was a nice comfortable area to relax; enjoy a swim, meal and/or refreshment. I didn’t venture into the gym (I was too busy holidaying and relaxing), but saw quite a few people go in. Chatting with them, no one complained about the gym, so that is a good sign The big, big thing for me at this hotel is the staff, I found them truely amazing. I can not sing their praises enough. From those at the front of the hotel, through to those on the reception/information desk, housekeeping, restaurant etc., they were all so very, very friendly and welcoming. The staff were always smiling and were so very helpful, they are such a huge asset to the hotel. Sorry, I can’t remember everyone’s names, but a big thanks to all. I must also give a big thumbs up and shout out to Andre, Tovany, Sigit and the others at the pool area and 10/10 Pool Bar Rooftop - You guys are the best, I’m going to miss you."

"69.","Alghi Alfiesta","6","2025-07-07","5","I recently stay at Novotel Suites Malioboro and had an absolutely wonderful experience. From the moment we arrived, the friendly and welcoming staff with their warm hospitality truly stood out and added so much value to our stay. The room was spacious, clean, and well-equipped with modern amenities, ensuring a comfortable stay. The bed was cozy, and the overall design of the suite was stylish yet functional. The location is perfect! Right in the heart of Malioboro, making it incredibly convenient for shopping, dining, and exploring Yogyakarta’s vibrant culture. Everything we wanted to see was within easy reach. What made our stay even more special was the birthday compliment from the hotel that I requested before to celebrate my son and my wife birthday. The thoughtful gesture truly touched us and made our short one-day stay feel extra memorable and cozy. It’s these little details that show how much they care about their guests. Overall, Novotel Suites Malioboro exceeded my expectations. With its excellent service, great room quality, unbeatable location, and heartwarming touches, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Yogyakarta. I’d love to stay here again in the future!"

Breakfast was great selection of different varieties, during our last day which required an early check out the staff help us with breakfast to-go :) One thing, they closed Malioboro street now from 6-9 pm (I think, or around that time). So you need to go around it if you travel by car. Avoid Malioboro because the traffic sucks. I notice a box in the hallway for recycling, so cute."

But the staff for resepsionis approached us immediately (I am sorry, I didn't catch the name, but thank you! ) and handle our check in smoothly. I had requested for non smoking room, but again, because of the holiday seasons, the available room was for smoking. The lady in the Reception told us, if the non smoking rooms available next day, she would arrange it so we can changed. But, turn out the rooms was totally fine. No smoking odor, which is good when you're travelling with small kids. We had also welcoming cake and it was nyummy delicious. The room also very clean, bathroom might a bit small but ok. The house keeping doing very good job, cleaned our room very fast but still spotless! The staff, the security, very friendly and always helpfull and never forget to greetings. The pool also very clean. We always took the time at noon or night, so we had the pool for ourselves! Breakfast with good variety The location in the heart of famous Malioboro street. Even when the main street closed in the evening, you can have the alternatives street on the other side. Overall was very happy stayed at Novotel suites! Thank you for your charmed Hospitality and also for the gift! Ps. My husband and the kids loves the tastes 'welcoming drinks' at the lobby, especially after a hot day outside walking 😄"

The AC not cold enough😢 well, we only stay for 12 hours, check in late almost midnight, and check out before 12. Mayb other facilities are good. For location, if u plan on stroll around Malioboro then it is a perfect location, if not, then it would be a bit annoying ( the traffic )."

"147.","Patrick Connolly","289","2025-06-07","5","Even if you don't stay here, visiting the pool/restobar on the 10th floor for the views and breeze is worth visiting. I won't go into detail, but the comments on Google Maps seem genuine and not fake. It's an older building, but it is well maintained with comfortable beds, white towels, and sheets. I had a cheaper room, but the views to the east were great with the big windows. Get breakfast included, well worth it with an outdoor smoking area. The location is perfect for walking out your door and getting to the train station without much hassle. My favorite part was the Restobar on the roof with the excellent staff- they seem to love their job, and that's where I met the GM and Chef twice (they were not drinking, but making sure guests are taken care of). Anyway, the Wi-Fi worked for five days without having to log in every time, the security was excellent, and the best part was the list of recommended restaurants for guests upon arrival. They were great with extensive menus, and I ate at them and enjoyed the vast selection, but the service didn't match the quality of service at this hotel. Anyway, the staff at the rooftop was personable and honest- Andre, Made, Upay, Rhe, and Bhuda. The gym is in working order, secure with good AC, towels, water, and available children, and open 24 hours, but it is small, not up to the standards of a big city gym. That's the only con here."
"148.","AND NUGROHO","6","2025-07-07","4","My recent stay at Novotel Suite Yogyakarta was, overall, just an average experience. Considering the price of over IDR 1 million per night, I found it to be less than worthwhile, especially when compared to other hotels under the Accor management that offer better quality for under IDR 1 million. Upon entering the room, I noticed some minor stains on the bedspread, which was a bit off-putting. Another small but inconvenient detail was the absence of a laundry bag in the room. I had to specifically request one, and even then, what arrived was just a clear plastic bag, not a proper laundry bag. The drop-off area for vehicles was also quite uncomfortable. It required reversing into a tight space and descending to the basement for parking. This made the entire process difficult and inconvenient for guests, particularly due to the cramped space."

Minus : - lift sedikit noise berbunyi agak sedikit menakutkan buat saya yang udah takut naik lift, ditambah terdengar suara mesinnya. - tidak ada sisir kecil - tidak ada pensil dan kertas catatan. Saran : Tetap nyalakan AC karena klo dimatikan, pas masuk , ada aroma gak enak kayak karpet lembab, wajar karena alas lantainya sebagian besar karpet."

Saya ada tertinggal barang di hotel, dan saya kontak kepada petugas terkait supaya tolong dikeep sementara karena akan ada rekan saya yg akan mengambil barang saya yg tertinggal tsb. Saya sudah ingatkan berkali-kali agar dikeep dengan baik. Harusnya saat didatangi oleh rekan saya normalnya barang sudah dikeep dengan aman dan tersedia dong. Bahkan dokumentasi barangnya yg tertinggal seperti apa sudah diketahui oleh pihak hotel. Namun anehnya saat didatangi oleh rekan saya, barang statusnya malah masih dicari, rekan saya kabarnya sudah cukup lama menunggu petugas mencari dan harus segera meninggalkan hotel karena keburu jadwal keberangkatan kereta. Disini pertanyaan saya adalah 1. Apakah tidak ada komunikasi yg baik antar petugas yg berjaga secara shift terkait barang tertinggal yg sudah dipesankan sebelumnya oleh customer? 2. Apakah penanganan lost & found ini benar-benar serius ditanggapi oleh pihak hotel? Saya sudah berpesan dan mengingatkan pihak hotel supaya barang tsb dikeep dengan baik. Tanpa harus dijelaskan dengan detail rasanya hotel sekelas Novotel sudah tau tentang hal begini Jujur saya kecewa dengan penanganan lost & found di hotel ini 🤦‍♂️"

The room was spacious and impeccably clean, with a sofa that conveniently transformed into a sofa bed. The hotel's location is perfect, situated right next to Malioboro Street, making it incredibly easy to explore the vibrant culinary and shopping scene of the area. The breakfast was delightful, offering a variety of Western and Asian dishes. I particularly enjoyed the Gudek corner, which added a local touch to the dining experience. The rooftop pool was a highlight, providing stunning views while enjoying a relaxing swim. Overall, Novotel Malioboro Yogyakarta exceeded my expectations with its comfortable accommodations, convenient location, delicious dining options, and picturesque rooftop pool. I would highly recommend it for anyone visiting Yogyakarta!"
"168.","Edwin Azmiramdhan Sulaiman (Edwin / Lemon)","335","2025-01-07","5","I stayed at Novotel Suite Yogyakarta during my recent trip, and honestly, I couldn’t have picked a better place. From the moment I walked in, the warm smiles from the staff made me feel right at home. They were so attentive, making sure I had everything I needed and even offering tips on the best places to visit nearby. The room? Wow. It was spacious, spotless, and had such a cozy vibe. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud, and I really appreciated the little touches—they have mini sink and even have a microwave. Breakfast was a treat! I loved the mix of local dishes and international options. Trying the traditional Indonesian foods was such a nice touch—I even asked for recipes for a couple of dishes I couldn’t get enough of! One of my favorite moments was relaxing by the rooftop pool. The view of the city was stunning, especially at sunset. It was such a peaceful way to end a day of sightseeing, and the setting felt almost magical. Overall, this wasn’t just a place to stay—it felt like a part of my Yogyakarta experience. If you’re looking for somewhere comfortable, convenient, and genuinely welcoming, I’d wholeheartedly recommend Novotel Suite Yogyakarta. I’m already looking forward to my next visit!

"169.","Nur Rizki Daniar Pradana","45","2025-06-07","4","We came to 10/10 Pool Bar Rooftop for dinner and had a lovely time. Although we had to wait around 20 minutes for the food, we understood since the hotel was running at high occupancy on long weekends. It would’ve been nice if the staff had informed us about the delay, but overall the service was still polite. Special thanks to Rama at the front desk, he was so friendly and welcoming. I really appreciated the way he greeted us and even took the time to escort us from the lobby to the restaurant. It made a great first impression and added a warm touch to our visit. The beef burger was delicious, juicy and flavorful, served with crispy french fries. I also really enjoyed the Lumpia Mataram; the portion was big, and the price was very reasonable. The atmosphere is cozy and relaxing, with a beautiful rooftop view overlooking the swimming pool and city skyline. The location is also very convenient, just a short walk from Malioboro, which makes it an easy choice for both locals and tourists. A few small suggestions: when I arrived, the table I chose was still wet as it had just stopped raining. It would be nice if the staff could prepare or dry the tables beforehand during weather changes. Also, it would be great if the waiter or F&B manager could walk around occasionally to check on guests and ensure everything is okay. As part of an international chain under the Accor Group, maintaining consistent service standards would make the experience even better."

Pd saat mau pulang, hendak bayar parkir ke receptionist Novotel diminta biaya 50.000 utk parkir oleh Security bernama NUGROHO. Dan dengan ngotot ala jawa nya, berkeras bahwa kami sudah diinfo 50.000 utk biaya parkir. Yang mana kami bertemu 3 security, tidak ada yg menjelaskan di awal utk ongkos parkir 50.000 Hanya bilang, parkir hanya utk tamu hotel dan tdk ada omongan 50.000 , dan diinfo nanti kalau gitu biaya parkir ke mba receptionist langsung. Sangat disayangkan sekali hotel sekelas Novotel dicemarkan oleh sikap security yang ngotot ke customer soal parkir 50rb dibandingkan berapa nilai yg customer akan keluarkan 2.8jt utk nginep semalam. Nilai yg jauh sekali hanya krn kami merasa ditagih 50rb nilai kecil tapi tidak Fair, sehingga menyebabkan kami sudah tidak punya selera utk mencoba Novotel Malioboro !!! Pihak management Novotel tolong diperbaiki sistem pengelolaan securitynya. Tidak seperti itu cara menghadapi customer dan tidak mencerminkan KELAS hotel jaringan internasional !"

"198.","Firstian Kautsar Adiguno","14","2025-01-07","5","Sebagai seorang frequent traveler, tiba di hotel dan langsung bisa beristirahat adalah hal yang sangat mahal. Seringkali kita dari bepergian jauh dan begitu tiba di hotel, ternyata kamar belum ready atau kondisi AC belum on. Namun hal itu tidak terjadi pada stay saya di Novotel Suites Malioboro Yogyakarta ini. Kamar sudah siap, dingin, amenities lengkap dengan welcoming notes menyambut saya begitu tiba di Yogyakarta. Saya langsung rebahan di kasur dan tak terasa saya tidur siang yang nyenyak selama hampir 3 jam. Lokasi hotel sangat dekat dengan stasiun Tugu Yogyakarta, masih di area Malioboro awal, namun jauh dari hingar bingar Jalan Malioboro yang tak pernah sepi. Suasana nya begitu tenang dan damai. Seluruh staf sangat ramah, dan appreciaate untuk mas Haifani yang melayani proses check-in saya dengan sangat smooth. Bangun tidur, saya langsung mandi dan menuju rooftop bar untuk menikmati welcome drink dengan pilihan yang sangat beragam sembari menikmati awal malam di Jogja. Setelah itu melangkah mencari makanan di sekitaran hotel yang menawarkan banyak pilihan, salah satunya Lumpia Mataram Samijaya yang selalu menyenangkan bagi saya. Esoknya, breakfast option pun yang banyak opsi menarik, baik lokal tradisional maupun pilihan Western, semuanya ada. Karena di Jogja, saya langsung mencoba gudeg nya dan entah mengapa, saya lebih menyukai rasa gudeg di Food Exchange resto ini dibandingkan merk Gudeg terkenal yang ada di Jalan Dagen (finger's crossed). Sedihnya adalah saya harus segera check-out di pagi hari karena ada pesawat yang harus dikejar di YIA, sehingga fasilitas lain di hotel seperti gym dll belum sempat dicoba, pun leyeh-leyeh lebih lama di hotel dengan opsi late check-out belum bisa saya rasakan. Itu artinya, saya akan kembali lagi ke sini dan mendapatkan pengalaman yang lebih lagi dalam waktu dekat. Pengalaman menyenangkan yang memang harus diulang kembali."

The room was upgraded to Junior Suite which suitable for families with sofa bed and spacious bath room. Activity and merchandise on Pirates program made kid very excited, happy and enthusiastic. Enjoy food menu from western to traditional with delicious taste at Food Exchange."

Sarapan ok, fasilitas ok, lokasi strategis dan dekat dengan malioboro Hal yang jadi concern saya adalah dari segi housekeeping nya 1. Sabun dari awal saya datang (saya stay selama 4 hari) sabun dalam kondisi hampir habis dan baru di refill di hari ke empat itupun setelah saya minta 2. Saya ga tau kamar dibersihkan secara detail atau nggak. Dibawah kolong tempat tidur ada bekas buah yang dimainin anak saya dari hari pertama dateng sampai pulang gak di cleanup 3. Ada benda yang terbuang oleh housekeeping padahal benda itu sangat penting dan berharga untuk anak saya karena jadi benda kesayangan nya, padahal posisi benda tersebut diletakkkan di tempat yang tidak seharusnya dibersihkan terlebih lagi dibuang. Harapannya dapat dijadikan masukan bagi team housekeeping untuk lebih teliti dan berhati2"

Mr.Sapto also helped to make sure our stay was enjoyable by offering special offerings for our family. By the way, the hotel's location is also perfect, right at the heart of Malioboro street. We couldn't choose a better accomodation than Novotel Suites at Malioboro. Highly recommended for personal or family stay."

The entrance to the mall is just outside the lobby. There is big mall, Plaza Malioboro, about 5 min walk from the hotel. Just a walking distance to the souvenir shops, souvenir market & eateries, about 5-7 min walk. The evening traffic jam is terrible. Nice swimming pool. Breakfast is good, with a wide variety.

Breakfast was great, plenty options at the restaurant. Gym facility could be improved. Most of accor hotels have better type and varriant of equipments. I had an issue in my room on the first night, I reported it immidiately to the front desk agent. The very next morning, it was handled very well by Ms Fitria, she personally came to see me then handled the issue (along with her collegue) and took care of it within minutes. For that I thank you very much! I wont hesitate to stay at Novotel suites when I return to Yogyakarta."

"236.","Nandi Bagus","24","2025-01-07","1","Pengalaman Sangat Buruk Pertama kali saya alami saat menginap di hotel Novotel Suites Mallioboro. Saya menginap 13 juli 2024 dan memilih hotel ini karena sangat dekat dengan tempat saya beracara di tanggal 14 Juli 2024 jam 04.00 meskipun sebenarnya dalam proses pemesanan hotel Juga mengalami kendala dan ketidaknyamanannya. Saya tidak akan membahas mengenai hal tersebut namun hal yang membuat saya marah, kecewa dengan pelayanan yang diberikan sekelas hotel Bintang 4 ini. Tanggal 14 Juli 2024 saya keluar dari kamar untuk aktivitas jam 04.00, posisi barang-barang pribadi saya rapikan dan dimasukan ke dalam koper dan tertinggal perlengkapan mandi di kamar mandi. Selesai aktivitas jam 09.00 saya kembali ke hotel dan langsung menuju tempat breakfast. Sekitar pukul 09.30 saya kembali menuju kamar dan betapa terkejutnya saya bahwa kamar saya dalam kondisi terbuka, selimut, bed cover sudah dalam kondisi tidak di tempat tidur. Padahal saya saat itu belum cek out dan tidak ada konfirmasi ke saya dari pihak hotel bahwa saya sudah cek out atau belum. Saya kemudian langsung cek koper, dan masih beruntung ternyata koper dan barang berharga masih tertinggal di kamar. Bagaimana hal ini bisa terjadi sekelas hotel Bintang 4?? Saat cek out saya menemui Pak Sapto, duty manager saat itu. Beliau menyampaikan permintaan maaf dengan alasan crew dilapangan salah dengar instruksi dari FO terkait kamar cek out yang seharusnya kamar 811 menjadi 911. Sebenarnya bagi saya itu bukan alasan yang masuk akal untuk hotel sekelas Novotel yang dalam pikiran saya tiap lantai pastinya ada PIC yang bertugas masing-masing. Pada dasarnya saya tidak mau memperpanjang hal ini, pada saat itu juga saya tidak meminta kompensasi apa-apa. Hanya saya minta ke Pak Sapto untuk membuat permintaan maaf tertulis dan disampaikan segera ke email saya. Saya beri waktu di hari senin, namun mungkin saya terlalu berekspektasi terlalu tinggi terhadap ketulusan hotel ini meminta maaf. Sampai hari selasa sore tanggal 16 Juli 2024 dimana ulasan ini saya tulis, surat tersebut belum saya terima. Sungguh pelayanan dan handling customer yang sangat buruk dari hotel ini, kalau bukan dekat dengan tempat acara pasti saya memilih hotel lain yang hospitality jauh lebih baik dari hotel ini."

Arrived at night, the front office and security welcoming us with warmth and smile. Parking lot is accommodated. Check in process was swift. The room is spacious has sink and microwave. Thing I didn't like about the room is shower door, it kinda combo functionality as toilet door but it's weird. The sandblasted window in shower area doesn't have blackout curtain and no rubber mat, less comfort for family trip when showering. The best thing is on the rooftop there's hangout area with games prepared and 24-hour gym, and definitely pool. Unfortunately, during my trip, the mall connection to the hotel is partially closed, so only just small part of the mall is connected, very disappointed since this is the main reason I'm booking this hotel. However, this is the best suite in Malioboro and will book this hotel again when visit the area."

Kamar yang terbilang luas dan bersih dengan interior yang lengkap. Ada mini kitchenete lengkap dengan microwave , sofa yang nyaman dan meja untuk bekerja . Service dan keramahan staffnya tidak perlu diragukan lagi, setiap orang yang saya temui di sini sangat membantu dan ramah. Poolbar di lantai 10 menyajikan aneka hidangan berat, snack dan beragam minuman serta kopi, menikmati suasana jogja dari poolbar bisa jadi pilihan ketika anda ingin menikmati waktu tapi enggan untuk keluar hotel. Ragam menu yang ditawarkan , disajikan dalam porsi yang terbilang besar, sangat rasional dari sisi harga dan seperti biasa staff yang ramah selalu siap membantu anda salah satunya ada Mas Adam yang cekatan dan super helpful."

"285.","Umami Utami","81","2025-01-07","3","menurut pendapat saya, hotel *4 ini standar aja dan yang menjadi nilai jual adalah brand dan lokasi yg berada d tengah area malioboro yang nempel dengan mall malioboro dan dekat dengan plaza malioboro dan akses mudah dari jalan mataram. selebihnya maintain your expectation untuk kamar yg pakai pintu kamar mandi model sliding dan furniture yg mulai terlihat usang (banyak bekas perbaikan/tambalan). untuk menu sarapan juga jangan berharap lebih, menunya simple dan pernah ngerasain masakan gudeg yg uda mulai asem rasanya dan cara masak yg tidak konsisten, pengalaman hari pertama makan bubur ketan hitam enak tapi hari kedua ketannya masih keras dan cuman dikasih air lebih banyak (dikira bakal lunak kali cuma direndem air) lalu baked bean nya juga kayanya masak sendiri (ga pakai yg kalengan) tp kacangnya masih cukup butuh effort buat dikunyah."

The minus points are no small towels for hair, body lotion, and unstable electricity (it was down thrice). The TV was lagged several times. Food: The buffet was good. Love the pastries. Amenities: good gym, spa, reading area, and pool on the rooftop, but unfortunately, no sauna/jacuzzi."
"292.","asfal fuad","1","2025-01-07","5","Salah satu hotel recommended di tengah pusat kota Jogja , lokasinya yg strategis sangat memudahkan bagi tamu yang ingin explore kawasan Malioboro dengan berjalan kaki. View dari rooftop hotel ini juga sangat memanjakan mata, jika langit cerah, indahnya kota jogja berlatar gunung Merapi bisa dinikmati di pagi hari. Kamar yang terbilang luas dan bersih dengan interior yang lengkap. Ada mini kitchenete lengkap dengan microwave , sofa yang nyaman dan meja untuk bekerja . Service dan keramahan staffnya tidak perlu diragukan lagi, setiap orang yang saya temui di sini sangat membantu dan ramah. Dan tak lupa trimakasih banyak buat mas Dinta yang sudah membantu kami selama berada di hotel."

It was very convenience to you who want to stroll around Malioboro Street. Because of the bad traffic, stay at this hotel is more make sense for you. The room's concept is more like apartment studio, i guess. Once you arrived at the room, there's small pantry with sink & microwave. The bed sofa could be convertible into a bed.

Still can't sleep from the itch 3 days later and had to treat my luggage and all my items carefully, hoping not to bring the problem back with me. It's a true inconvenience! Service was good and polite at check in but at check out, they looked at the red bites and asked if I was having an allergy! That brought down the rating. Location is good, just off Malioboro street, but frankly, will trade off location for a cleaner place. Never again!"

"317.","EA","63","2025-01-07","4","PUBLIC POOL ACCESS REVIEW Very recommended option if you want to get short getaway. I came here for the pool access (public entrance). You should spend minimum 100k on pool cafe per pax. The adult pool is 1.2m depth, the water is SO CLEAN, not too much chlorine. Very good view tho since it's on the rooftop. They provide towels too. We don't take any picture of menu but for 100k you got a coffee latte and french fries only. A bit pricy but it's on par with the good facilities you get. Although the facility is well maintained but there is no proper shower room for public (you cannot get proper bath). But they provide outdoor shower space so you can at least rinse the chlorine water before changing to dry clothes. Although I only come for the pool access, but the hospitality is top notch! They really treat you like the hotel guest."

It's really close to the station as well. The room itself is clean and spacious. They provide a sofa, water kettle, microwave, and sink inside the room. They also have a mini fridge to store your stuff. though, the windows are only facing an alleyway witha graffiti. No cityview or anything, but it's not a problem for me. Went there alone for a business trip, but i think it will be good for a family vacations too."

And now I’m back with a glass of Beauty Tipsy that has a perfect balance of bitterness and sweetness. It’s a refreshing drink to have whilst waiting for the sun to set.

Checkin late banget, dapet kamar di high floor pojokan gitu mang enak sih sepi nggak bising ya, kamar juga cukup luas. fasilitas kaya hotel kebanyakan yah, tapi plusnya sih ada microwave sama sink terus beberas alat makan juga kesedia. mantabb deh yang ini. Bener-bener nggak kerasa stay disini dari minggu-rabu nyaman aja gitu, servicenya oke banget deh mas-mbaknya ramah semua. mana ada aja pas sendal jepit anak saya jatoh di parkiran eh dicariin sampe ketemu dong ya sama staff mereka—grateful sekali. So sad nggak sempet ngintipin restonya, yeah tiap hari kudu bfast di kamar soalnya bocil nggak bisa bangun pagi heuheu. Oke kita ke pool, jadi meskipun sakit doi nggak bisa banget skip poolnya ya, jadilah kita ke rooftop, enak sih nggak yang panas banget padahal dah agak siang juga pas naik, terus ada pool buat bocil juga—disamping juga ada mini playground. ada cafe juga bisa sambil kongkow. oke terakhir, si bocil dapet owl doll kuning unyu hihi—thankyou so much novotel 🤎"

"351.","Wahyu Jati","73","2024-01-07","2","review jujur pengalaman iftar disini, semoga bisa menjadi perhatian pihak manajemen hotel, waktu liat postingan di ig ada 2 pilihan venue iftar dengan harga yg berbeda, ternyata pas WA admin diinfokan bahwa ada update harga dan venue hanya di resto karena cuaca sedang tidak mendukung kalau di poolbar. Diinfo kalau ready jam 17.00, pas sudah sampai resto ternyata diarahkan menuju poolbar karena disana juga sudah disiapkan, katanya menunya juga lebih komplit dan staff yang bertugas menginfokan kalau iftar di resto sebenarnya cuma 155k (udah beda info dengan admin WA), okelah kita menuju poolbar, udah jam 17.00 lebih dan sampai menjelang berbuka puasa, staff yang ada masih sibuk nyiapin venue sama makanan, padahal katanya jam 17.00 udah siap, mungkin karena itu juga sampai menjelang berbuka puasa belum pada ambil makanan, sungkan kali yaa, makanan masih belum dibuka, masih terbungkus plastik wrap, malahan saya sampai sempet buka plastik wrap bumbu siomay nya sendiri lhoo, mana gak ada saos/kecapnya, jadi staff yang bertugas di stall makanannya itu terbatas banget, stall nasi bryani-roast chicken-rib-sei yang jaga cuma 1 orang sampe kerepotan banget, ntah itu masnya sempet istirahat gak, kasian juga. jam 18.30 udah banyak makanan yang habis sampe ditinggal sholat maghrib/isya pas kembali masih belum di refill juga. jadi kesannya all you can eat tapi gak ada yang di eat. akhirnya si iga nya di refill tapi ternyata pas dimakan masih dingin (bukan dingin suhu ruangan, tapi kayak baru keluar dari freezer), untuk rasa dan varian B aja sih, gak nemu yg istimewa, sei nya keras banget, menu unggulan iga dan scallop gak memuaskan, malahan aneka cake yang biasanya ada tapi gak ada, cuman jajanan pasar aja. oiyaa satu lagi, pliss laahh mosok hotel suites pakainya wadah makan-minum plastik/kertas sekali pakai, udah macam kayak di street food aja, di review sebelumnya udah ada yang nulis tapi masih sama gitu juga gak ada pembenahan. dengan rates harga dan embel-embel suites nya cukup membuat kecewa sih, nilai plusnya cuman karena dapet venue di rooftop dan kebetulan cerah aja."

We let Andre make recommendations for food and beverage and that turned out perfectly. He asked us a few questions and then selected 2 Indonesian dishes that delighted us with new flavors and ingredients—just what we wanted for our first dinner in the city. Both dishes were excellent. You can order from the hotel restaurant at the rooftop bar and dine in or outside. Andre also served his signature cocktail with his house made bitters, which we also highly recommend. Terima kasih Andre! All the staff were friendly, professional, and attentive. The price is reasonable. The restaurant and bar gave us a chance to enjoy interesting local flavors in a quiet setting far above the bustle of Malioboro street. Recommended."

"367.","Marina Marino","187","2024-01-07","4","The hotel is located on Malioboro Street, next to Malioboro mall, hence it is very easy to buy food, drinks, medicine, even souvenirs as the location of the mall is precisely next to it, and on Malioboro street there are so many souvenir shops. The room we booked is nice, has a beautiful interior design, has a small living room, kitchen, safe, and bathroom (shower, no tub). One thing that was lack was the fact when we entered the room, there is some smoke smell whereas we booked smoke free room. But the staffs were helpful by providing air purifier to evade the smell though it took quite some time until the smell was completely gone. The amenities (shampoo and soap) have a very delightful fragrant and the shower water heater works well. The spa room was not ready when we visited, hence you could only book spa to your room (but without additional charges)."

Mereka membantu sampai ayah sy bs ditangani tepat dan wkt dan msk ke ICCU. Bahkan menyampaikan apabila butuh bantuan mohon sampaikan kepada mereka. Sungguh luar biasa tim emergency NOVOTEL Suites Jogja. Terima kasih atas bantuannya, saya belum sempat menyampaikan langsung dikarenakan kondisi kmrn yg sangat hectic berbarengan dengan sy hrs check out.

Iga bakar kehabisan terus wkwk giliran dapet malah yg masih frozen, jd iga bakar rasa es :( kue kuenya, cuma menu jajanan pasar kah ? gaada chocolate cake, cheese cake dan sejenisnya (itu sih yg saya bayangkan). jujur agak kecewa sih, maaf yaa.

Kami ingin memberikan apresiasi tertinggi kepada Mba Lolita, staf Novotel Suites Malioboro, atas dedikasinya yang luar biasa dalam membantu kelancaran pernikahan klien kami.

Mulai dari showing, food test, technical meeting, hingga persiapan H-1 untuk setup venue, Mba Lolita selalu mendampingi kami dengan penuh perhatian. Dedikasi beliau yang tinggi patut diapresiasi. Meskipun kami dihadapkan pada beberapa kendala teknis dari atasan Mba Lolita, Bapak A****, yang terkesan mempersulit klien kami saat technical meeting, Mba Lolita tetap tenang dan sigap mencarikan solusi. Beliau selalu berusaha memberikan yang terbaik untuk klien kami. Berkat kerja keras dan dedikasi Mba Lolita dan tim, serta tim Novotel Suites Malioboro, pernikahan klien kami di bulan Juni lalu dapat berlangsung dengan lancar dan sukses.

"402.","Marya","170","2024-01-07","1","I don't think I've ever been so disappointed to turn my room key and walk into a hotel room. It's like a small monochromatic, grey cave. The room smells like smoke and off gassing. It wasn't clean, though I saw the cleaning guy (just one guy) working hard and I don't want to fault him. He was very kind and friendly. There was pubic hair on my bed, hair in the shower, the surfaces aren't clean and the light switches were so dirty I had to wipe them off before I'd use them. One window doesn't shut so it's hot and loud and smelly. I didn't ask to change rooms because I thought the open window might help with the offgassing a bit. We wanted to use the pool but there were kids swimming without diapers. The hotel caters to kids, not adult or business travelers. At breakfast there were plates of donuts and sugary things and the many, many kids loved them. I ate fruit. The gym is small and the equipment is mostly broken. For the price, I expected far more. This should be a 2 star hotel."

"407.","Listya Nugrahsari","10","2024-01-07","2","I checked for 3 days and 2nights. A night before check out, I came to the front desk and asked for a late check-out. The assigned staff immediately granted to get the late check-out until 1300. Tomorrow morning around 11:30, I was informed by a call to the room that I needed to extend the key card to enable getting the access. My concern is if the late check out has been confirmed a night before; and especially the confirmation is immediately made by a walk-in to the front desk, the hotel staff should have confirmed this immediately by the time guest heard directly from the hotel staff. It’s super ineffective to go back again the day after just to extend the key card. The hotel system is created by human so everything can be actually adjusted. Please provide white bright towels in the room. You have very shadowed towels and unbright white towels for guests. Please be mindful since nobody wants to apply/rub your unbright-shadowed white colored towels with that condition. The hanger can not be taken out from the cabinet. I don’t want to take it as a souvenir, but it’s so difficult to hang clothes/ items if you install the hangers. The hotel has changed the laundry bag to the laundry big box which is so inefficient for guests. If you don’t want the laundry bag is always missing after the guests check out, apply the charges on that just like you charge the third mineral water bottle in the room."

Untung petugasnya ramah banget, bantu2 ngarahin gbcuek bebek. Pas di resepsionis, petugasnya juga ramah, ditanyain ktp, kartu vaksin dan hasil swab antigen (jangan lupa disiapin 3 hal itu, terutama masa2 PPKM gini). Proses cek in lumayan cepat (nunggu sekitar 10 menitan) Roomnya lumayan luas, ada karpaetnya. Kebetulan bawa anak kecil, jadi rada ngerasa aman. Ameties lumayan lengkap, sayang g disediakan kopi sachet (untungnya dekat mal, jadi g perlu ribet). Kolam renang di lantai 10, lumayan luas juga. Pemandangannya bagus, cuma kalau siang agak panas. Poolnya dibuka dari jam 07-19. Ada akses ke mall maliobori juga, jadi g perlu muter kedepan. Minusnya untuk lantai kamar mandi rada2 licin. Kemaren hampir aja kejedot 😂😌🥲 dan rada2 susah jalannya, karena g bisa lewat Malioboro kalau diatas jam 7 malam Untuk breakfast, variasi menunya tidak begitu banyak (kalau dibandingkan dengan beberapa hotel yang pernah saya singgahi, disini variasinya yang paling sedikit) tapu rasa masakannya lumayan enak. Untuk soto sama gudegnya khaas jogja banget (kurang cocok sama lidah saya yang asli solo) yang lain2 enak, jenang sum sumnya gurih, jus kiwinya aku juga suka. Rekomen lah untuk yang mau staycation disini. Harganya masih bisa dibilang terjangkau untuk hotel bintang 4 di kawasan Malioboro"

Namun berlangsung beberapa saat saja. Sehingga menurut saya tidak terlalu mengganggu. Untuk harga mulai dari 1 jutaan per malam. Mungkin jika ada promo bisa lebih murah"

"428.","S D'Cruz","3","2025-01-07","2","I booked 2 rooms (1 via Agoda and 1 direct). The website described a sofa bed in the superior studio king or twin beds room, but it doesn't function as a sofa bed. When I asked, the receptionist explained that only the room with the king-size bed has the sofa bed. Seriously? I was so disappointed, and the hotel even had the cheek to want to charge an additional Rp450,000 for an extra bed. If it weren't for the friendliness of the staff and their willingness to do their utmost for you, I would have given a 1-star rating. Red and brown stains on the bed linen are not acceptable. The fridge in the room does not function properly (for display purposes only, according to the receptionist). Upon check-in, the facility, breakfast time, and Accor Loyalty Membership were not explained. I only found out about the Accor member benefits when paying for drinks at the pool bar, and when I came down to reception to claim the points, they said only the room booked directly with the hotel can claim points. Information on TV does not work properly - all gimmicky. The TV and hairdryer stopped working - I had to call an engineer. The hairdryer in the room does not work at all. Claiming to be a 4-star hotel but using shampoo/soap dispenser in the shower that doesn't function properly, and I had to ask the engineer to remove the bottles from the bracket so I could use the shampoo and soap. No small towels were provided in both rooms on arrival. The next day, only 1 room was given small towels. Tissues had a funny smell as they are kept in a leather-like box. Not sure how long they have been in there. My credit card was charged before I arrived at the hotel, and I had to contact my bank to ensure the refund was processed immediately. Considering I made many calls to Reception to report the issues, nobody from management offered acknowledgement. No management in sight during our stay (16 & 17 April 2024). Good location in the center of Malioboro - other than that, I am not sure if it is worth the money."

"430.","Haekal Rizky Yulianto","8","2025-12-07","5","“A Pleasant Experience in Malioboro—Good Hotel with Minor Fixes Needed” I recently stayed at Novotel Suites Yogyakarta and had a pleasant overall experience. The hotel offers a comfortable and modern atmosphere, and its location is excellent—right in the Malioboro area, making it very convenient for shopping, dining, and sightseeing. The staff were consistently friendly and welcoming, which added to the positive stay. Breakfast was also a highlight, with delicious options and good variety. There are, however, a few areas that could be improved. The mushola facilities could be better maintained to offer more comfort for guests, and the bathroom floor in the room was quite slippery, which might be a safety concern. Additionally, it was surprising that even extra bottles of drinking water were charged separately. Overall, Novotel Suites Yogyakarta is a great place to stay with strong potential to be even better with a few refinements."

Their attention to detail and thoughtfulness did not go unnoticed, and it made a significant difference in the quality of my stay. During my last night, while enjoying some drinks at the rooftop bar, where Andre and Rezza delivered impeccable service. Their warmth, professionalism, and dedication created a wonderful ambiance, allowing me to end my trip on a high note. Additionally, I greatly appreciated the restaurant staff accommodating my request for an early breakfast before the official timing. This thoughtful gesture allowed me to check out on time for my early morning departure and showcased their commitment to guest satisfaction. Thank you to the entire team at Novotel Yogyakarta Malioboro for your outstanding hospitality. I look forward to returning and experiencing your exceptional service once again!"

"435.","Faiz Perjuangan","310","2022-01-07","5","Review di kala pandemi: Salah satu hotel terbaik di Kota Jogja. Fasilitas kamar standart sih, namun desain interior hotel cukup menarik. Hotel kedua di Jogja yang saya temui menggunakan smart tv dengan ukuran cukup besar, dan hotel pertama yang saya temui menyediakan fasilitas microwave, bahkan ada tempat cuci sendiri untuk cuci piring/gelas. Rasa menu sarapan Terlihat biasa seperti menu sarapan hotel bintang pada umumnya, tapi menu sarapan yang saya coba enak, sayang tidak ada minuman jus buah. Untuk area restoran termasuk cukup luas dan nyaman, serta disini adalah salah satu hotel yang memberikan smoking area paling nyaman dan luas di restoran (baru kali ini saya nemu hotel kayak gini). Padabarea kolam renang di rooftoop juga cukup luas dan menyenangkan, serta gym yg cukup nyaman. Overall..rekomended untuk staycation"

"438.","Maminya Natasha","7","2023-01-07","4","Menginap di Novotel Malioboro pada 14 April 2022 kamar 931. Lokasi sangat dekat dengan Mall Malioboro. Dan gampang untuk cari makan. Hal yang sangat mengganggu adalah : 1. Suara dari luar atau kamar sebelah terdengar masuk kami. Jika menggunakan Gipsum ada baiknya ditambah peredam di dinding. 2. Ada baiknya ada petugas yg mengawasi lift. Karena pada saat itu sedang ada acara buka bersama. Dan beberapa tamu buka bersama naik lift melebihi kapasitas yg telah di tentukan padahal sudah saya ingatkan. Karena pandemi ada baiknya peraturan mengenai jumlah kapasitas lift ditempel di depan / dekat tombol tunggu lift. Beberapa hal yang saya sukai dari Novotel ini adalah : 1.Walau lahan parkir kurang banyak namun Security dan petugas parkir sangat sigap membantu mengarahkan saat parkir. 2. Staff sangat baik. ketika guling anak saya tertinggal. Membantu untuk mengirimkan ke alamat rumah kami. 3. Handuk bersih dan yg utama sangat tebal. 4. Penerangan kamar cukup 5. Kamar bersih 6. Ada becak di depan hotel yg menawarkan jasa dengan biaya yg sangat terjangkau hanya 10Rb saja. Info dari Bapak Becak nya harga tersebut khusus untuk tamu hotel saja karena Bpk Becak kerja sama dengan pihak hotel. Untuk kekurangan hotel ini sangat masih bisa di tolerir. Semoga bs menjadi masukan untuk pihak management hotel. Terimakasih"

Paling menarik yg di rooftopnya sih kalau lg ga ujan oke banget! Mulai dr starter, appetizer, maincourse ampe dessert komplit! Awal yg menarik & cukup berkesan di puasa pertama kmrn. Rooftopnya asik bgt vibenya buat nyore sambil nunggu buka. Sambil cuci mata lihat2 menu-menu buffetnya. Menu takjilnya komplit dan banyak pilihan, ada jajan pasar juga! Kemarin belum begitu rame sih karena mungkin masih hari kedua. Utk ratenya poolbar 185rb/pax kalau yg di resto 155rb/pax Gaskeuun buat yg nyari spot buka di rooftop"

Fasilitas menginap disini juga dah komplit, ada sabun, shampo, conditioner, hand body, pemanas air, welcome drink, gelas, hair dryer, handuk, kulkas mini, microwave, lemari. Dan kamar di hotel ini semi apartemen gitu, jadi ada kursi sofanya juga. Selain itu, di hotel ini juga ada kolam renang dan gymnya.

Hanya yg bermasalah security yg sombong arogan tak ber etika dalam berbicara ke tamu, pintar berbohong dan memilih milih tamu untuk bisa mendapatkan Parkir di depan lobby. Untuk restoran ditingkatkan untuk tasty breakfast petugas staf staf di tempat breakfast bisa lebih ramah ke semua tamu, Para karyawan di restoran breakfast agar wajahnya ditambah senyuman jangan kelihatan kayak wajah murung kayak dibawah tekanan kerja. Ramahnya jangan milih milih tamu ya, yang saya lihat dengan mata kepala sendiri dilokasi yang ditanyain mau minum apa oleh waitress2 nya hanya tamu2 yang khusus sekitar 2 sampai 6 orang selebihnya tidak disapa bahkan tidak ditanyakan mau minum apa. Saya tamu loyal member accor platinum tidak ada apresiasi di hotel Novotel suite Yogya. Bahkan minta sepotong Jahe iris untuk nge teh aja harus memohon dan itupun dibilang Jahe habis dan harus bayar extra lagi di cafe rooftop. Dan akhirnya dikasih setelah saya katakan apakah Main kitchen masak makanan tidak pakai jahe. Semua ukuran berbayar. Mau minjem tambahan bantal dan selimut pun tadinya disuruh bayar dan saya bilang oke saya bayar berapa dan akhirnya dibilang tanya ke atasannya dulu berapa bayarnya, tiba tiba diinfo ga usah bayar. Baru kali ini nemu hotel member accor yang model begini . MOHON DIPERBAIKI attitude karyawan staf lapangannya. Kalo ada tarif tarif tambahan mohon dicantumkan dengan jelas. Semoga kedepannya semakin dibenahi dan semakin sukses."

Saya kira harga juga berubah karna venue nya berbeda. Ternyata harga nya sama. Coba tanya petugas resto alasannya menu pool di pindah semua di resto. Yang jadi pertanyaan, tamu yg pesen di resto dg harga 150k juga dpt makan menu pool dong ya? Krn disitu tidak dipisahkan. Saat komplain ke petugas resto Ga ada winwin solutions. Mau ga mau bayar sesuai pesanan dg kecewa. Menu dimsum tidak ada siomay, waktu tanya chef nya katanya habis. Padahal saya di situ datang awal dan meja saya juga deket dan belum ada orang yang ambil di area dimsum. Bakpao keras, sekelas hotel bintang 5 jajanan pasar minim seperti hotel bintang 3."

Not really about the views but the people we met there, the singer couple, Yvonne and her husband. This lovely couple performed a Chinese song as soon as we arrived.

"465.","Matt Koenig","24","2023-01-07","3","We stayed 4 nights at Novotel Suites Yogyakarta Malioboro in the Superior Studio room with a King sized bed. This is a hotel that was built in 1997 and last renovated in 2019 so we were a little surprised by the condition of the hotel and the room. Check-in was easy and the front desk staff were all very friendly and helpful (5 stars for all the staff). The room was very spacious and the bed was comfortable. We had a view of the city which was nice. The bathroom had a weird layout which didn’t work well. But the biggest complaint was the mold in the corner of the room near the shower and along the edges of the carpet. Other aspects of the room seemed dated as well. The walls between room seem very thin and you can often hear your neighbors or sounds from the hallway. Overall the hotel seemed very dated for one that had supposedly been renovated in 2019. Our room included a breakfast which was buffet style and located on the 8th floor. Unfortunately this is also the smoking floor so when you get off the elevator for breakfast you are confronted with the smell of cigarette smoke. You get used to it in Indonesia but still I think maybe the smoking rooms should be on a different floor for those sensitive to the smell of smoke. The buffet breakfast was excellent (5 stars for the food and staff). Lots of options from traditional Indonesian dishes to Western food and a large dining area with outside seating for those that smoke and eat. Bayu was great at making omelets and the rest of the staff were also very friendly and helpful. Made in particular was super helpful and provided great service. The drop off and pickup point of the hotel is odd. There is only a single way in and out so your driver has to turn around to go back out the same way and it’s quite tight especially when busy. The best part of this hotel is the location to Malioboro street. You are literally right there and can enjoy the shops, restaurants and sights easily by foot. There is a shopping mall right there and oddly a disconnected mall on several of the lower floors of the hotel itself (Malioboro Mall). We stumbled upon it by accident and access seems to have been limited (closed off to the main mall) which unfortunately has affected all the businesses at this location. Overall it was an OK stay and every staff member that we encountered was always super friendly and helpful. I’d probably stay here again just for the great location to Malioboro street and all the activities there but my wife said she would not stay here again."

Untuk layanan kamar, sdikit mengecewakan krn waktu itu handuk dn keset kki belum ready di kmr. Tpi overall layanan restorant, resepsionis ( panggil taxi untuk ke bandara) sngt bgus dan sigap. Saran untuk kamar, jika ad kerusakan meskipun itu kerusakan kecil, tolong untuk di perbaiki agar kami sebagai tamu bisa nyaman. Contoh kmr saya seperti pintu kmr mandi yg macet, gagang shower yg bocor dan stok kontak yg keluar dri dinding. Jadi saya harap Novotel Suites bisa lebih baik lagi kedepannya. Terima kasih."

Space parkir juga terbatas dan harus melalui turunan yang sempit sehingga menyulitkan untuk mobil besar. Mobil kami tergores ketika harus berbelok tajam untuk keluar dari parkiran, penjaga untuk memandu kadang ada seringnya tidak ada. Tempat parkir yang sempit ini menyebabkan penumpukan kendaraan di depan lobby dan menyebabkan kemacetan di depan hotel. Kamar dan kebersihan sangat baik, setting makan pagi juga sudah sesuai prokes."

Berada di Novotel Suites Malioboro Hotel yang berada di area perkotaan membuat saya mengagumi pemandangan kota Yogyakarta dari lantai 7. Menginap bersama adik dan sepupu kami serombongan mendapatkan kamar dengan type Studio Superior dengan King Bed Size dan 1 extra bed benar-benar membuat kami bisa recharge energi setelah setiap hari bekerja keras bagaikan kuda. Saya mendapatkan welcome drink yang super melimpah minuman rempah-rempah 1 botol penuh ukuran 1 liter, dan cokelat yang cantik di meja serta ada sambutan dari Mr. Novi Soesanto Manajer Hotel Novotel Suites Malioboro. Baru mau menikmati kamar yang comfy, terdengar ketukan dari luar, ternyata petugas hotel yang datang membawakan key card yang baru. sayapun kembali gegoleran di kasur yang super nyaman, tapi telpon terdengar, dari hotel menelpon lagi karena akan memberikan ekstra compliment makanan untuk dimakan di kamar. Wowowoow saya dan rombongan sirkus pun bersorak gembira. 5 menit kemudian petugas hotel sudah membawakan beragam makanan enak di meja. Memiliki studio room dengan desain modern, satya memang sangat menikmati pengalaman menginap yang luar biasa. Selain, karena Novotel Suites Malioboro Hotel memang strategis karena berada di Jalan Malioboro. Lokasi yang pas dan cocok bagi kalian vacationers. Iya memang Malioboro memang tempat yang menyenangkan untuk berjalan-jalan dan surga belanjanya Jogja dengan berbagai barang yang dijamin harganya terjangkau (asal mau menawar). Novotel Suites Malioboro Hotel ini juga terhubung langsung ke satu-satunya mall di kawasan Malioboro. Memiliki 147 kamar, Novotel Suites Malioboro Hotel memang disediakan untuk para vacationers atau pebisnis yang mau stay dalam waktu singkat maupun lama di Jogja. Terhubung langsung ke Malioboro Mall. Dekat dengan Stasiun Kereta Tugu dan pusat perbelanjaan besar lainnya di sepanjang Jalan Malioboro. Hotel yang strategis di tengah kota."

Kondisi kamar dan kamar mandi bersih karena hotel termasuk kategori baru. Fasilitas kulkas, hair dryer dan tempat cuci piring. Untuk kamar deluxe selain ukuran besar ada tambahan meja setrika dan jam weker di sebelah tempat tidur. Lokasi di belakang mall Malioboro, setelah hotel Malbaran pengganti Ibis. Sarapan menu Indonesia. Variasi tidak terlalu banyak tapi masakannya enak. Kolam renang dan cafe posisi di lantai atas"

We called and asked to be reassigned to another room and receptionist told us no room available. I had to go down and complained again. We were then re-assigned to 721. 2nd room - 721 AC switched off after running few minutes. Called engineering and were told AC was clogged. Room - very thin pillows and doesn’t provide real support - very thin blanket Lift - only 2 lifts serving guest rooms - long wait in the morning Access - lots of buses parking at the entry area - guest has to walk in since the entry is filled with buses and cars For the price range, you can get better hotel"

"515.","Aldino Reza Pratama","81","2021-01-07","5","saya menginap di hotel ini selama 2 malam. saya menginap ditengah masa pandemi covid-19. Luar biasa sekali, hotel ini menerapkan sistem protokol kesehatan yang sudah sesuai dengan prosedur yang diterapkan. Semua staff juga menerapkan protokol kesehatan terhadap semua tamu yang datang. Staff sangatlah ramah sekali, good job novotel suites!. Hotel ini tergolong masih baru sekali, soft opening baru saja dilaksanakan pada bulan desember 2019. Lokasi sangat strategis, hotel ini tidak memiliki direct access ke mall malioboro, namun kedepan saat grand opening telah dilaksanakan, tentunya hotel ini memiliki direct access ke mall malioboro. Hotel ini menurut saya cocok untuk dijadikan liburan keluarga. Kamar yang ditawarkan tergolong cukup luas, di dalam kamar terdapat microwave serta sink. Kasurnya sendiri pun sangatlah nyaman dan sangat besar. Smart TV yang ada di setiap kamar tergolong cukup besar untuk hotel kelas bintang 4 ini, dan sangat canggih sekali smart TV yang ada di kamar. Semua dapat dilakukan dengan hanya satu kali sentuhan. Sarapan nya sangat lezat sekali, untuk lokasi sudah tidak perlu diragukan lagi. Patut untuk anda coba sebagai salah satuy referensi apabila ingin stay di yogyakarta."
"516.","Iza Ahmad","325","2024-01-07","5","Best pokoknya di area Jalan Malioboro, cuma dapat yang twin bed, lalu ditawarkan digabung saja dari pihak hotel dan saya setujui. Dari beberapa pengalaman saya sebelumnya, yang namanya twin bed digabung ya hanya sebatas kasur digeser dan ditempelin aja, jadi tengahnya tetap aja ada celah yg bikin tidak nyaman kalau pas tidur di atasnya. Tapi tebakan saya rupanya salah, pihak hotel mengganti matras atasnya dengan yg single bed, jadi nyaman banget dan kaya makin luas aja nih kasur saya.. Overall best lah...."

Waktu pertama datang masuknya ke lobby Ibis karena yang terlihat langsung dari drop off. Lokasi hotel ini sangat strategis kalau mau jalan-jalan ke Malioboro. Cukup jalan kaki saja. Kelemahannya area parkir cukup sempit dengan tamu yang full di weekend. Juga fasilitas ATM."

Semoga ke depan hotel novotel suite bisa meningkatkan fasilitasnya"
"521.","veta mandra","293","2022-01-07","5","Hotel dengan protokol kesehatan terbaik di Jogja, baru mau masuk saja sudah dicek suhu, koper disemprot desinfektan, debest. Kamarnya keren, padahal cuma nginep di superior studio, room service cepat sekali pelayanannya, petugas yang membersihkan kamar memakai APD. Sangat keren. Semua makanannya enak, meskipun saya baru berkesempatan mencicipi sotonya, tapi sotonya bukan kaleng-kaleng. Biasanya kan soto di hotel cuma dibuat sebagai pelengkap pelengkap saja, nggo ono ono daripada ra ono. Tapi di Novotel Suites ini sotonya dibuat sangat niat. Minusnya cuma di parkir kurang luas dan suara kurang kedap jadi jangan teriak-teriak di kamar ya.. Saya pasti akan kembali lagi untuk staycation di sini. Oiya ada yg lupa, ada tembusan ke Malioboro Mall, itu nilai tambah sekali."
"522.","Raditya Ramadhani","12","2025-01-07","2","have been an accor member years and never had this kind of experience which made me write this review. Stayed at end of Mei in new Novotel Yogyakarta, i found my room smell smoke/cigarette. I called downstair and asked the receptionist to move. They told me that my room is indeed non-smoking room but they couldn't prevent if someone smoked at my room before (i guess you have smoke detector, right? Isn't it work?). They said they can not guarantee if bad smell still occur in other room too if they move me. Actually before put my complain, i found that my trash bin was full of cigarettes which also made me questioning the cleaning standard. In the morning i had a bad cough and my shirt smell like cigarette. When i check out i was asked whether i have complain and i mentioned my issue, but no compliment word were given nor any sorry. This is an experience which i never had in old Novotel jalan Sudirman or other Accor group hotels around Yogyakarta. Typically any other hotel will charge stayer for 1-2 millions if they found out stayer smoking in non-smoking room, but it seems that's not happen in here. Uniquely i also found the same review about bad cigarette smell in the room of Novotel Yogyakarta 3 months ago in the 1-star review 🥲"
"523.","Fitria","29","2023-01-07","4","Lokasinya strategis di tengah kota (Malioboro), pas samping Mall Malioboro. Fasilitasnya lumayan lengkap, ada microwavenya juga. Makanannya standard hotel bintang 4, lengkap ada makanan lokal, western. Recommended buat yang ingin fasilitas mewah dengan harga rata-rata hotel bintang 4. Hanya kamarnya ada kerasa bau rokok, jadi mungkin bisa ditambahkan pewangi otomatis gitu."
"524.","Sintia Astarina","312","2024-01-07","5","What a pleasant stay here at Novotel Suites Malioboro! Happy banget nginep di sini soalnya lokasinya persis di Malioboro dan dekat dengan Stasiun Tugu Yogyakarta, jadi ke mana-mana dekat dan bisa jalan kaki. Kalau mau ke Mall Malioboro, aksesnya juga gampang banget. Kamarnya cukup luas (bahkan bisa sampai untuk 4 orang), nyaman, bersih, terang, ada meja dan kursi yang nyaman kalau mau kerja (cocok juga bagi yang sedang business trip), dan yang kusuka, kemasan air mineral mereka nggak menggunakan plastik sekali pakai. Hotel ini mengusung konsep seperti studio apartemen, jadi di dalam kamar sudah ada microwave, sink, ruang tamu, juga Smart TV 55. Pool bar di sini juga asik! Lain ke kali liburan ke Jogja, mau ah nginep di sini lagi."

Ngak kan, kerja yang bener dikit, jangan merugikan orang lain, yg dimasukin busnya kayaknya juga ada privilege (hadeh, cemen amat ngak bisa nahan dikit)."

Staf sangat ramah, dari masuk ke parkir, lobi, rooftop pool bar, restoran. Terimakasih Mr. Dona atas sambutan dan welcome drink-nya. Hanya saja, saya tidak melihat playgound untuk bermain anak saya dan game PS 4 nya mohon ditambah game GTA V, hehehe.

"540.","Ilham Kusuma","99","2023-01-07","3","Location. That one word to describe what is best from this property. The location is right at the center of the city and only few steps away from the train stations, and the center of the city. Other than that it is a fairly good hotel. The room was comfortable enough, however the walls are thin, you will hear people talking in the corridor or the room next door. One most annoying thing is that during my stay the security at the front door always ask me my room number every time I entered the hotel, I wonder if they ask everyone or just me ? Room number is guest privacy, an international chain hotel should be aware of that. But the staff are very attentive and polite. If you want to stay in a practical hotel just to spend the night after a busy day outside, then this is the place. But if you need a hotel that can feels at home, look elsewhere."

Pelayanan nya oke, teman2 disini sangat membantu & ramah, khusunya Mas Bowo dibagian resto yg sigap kalau kita butuh buntuan, oia makanannya juga sangat variatif dan the taste is sooo goooood! Lokasinya one step away from Malioboro, untuk yg seneng jalan2 di malioboro tanpa ribet, it's a best choice, tapi kalau yg kurang suka dengan keribetan, karena malam hari Jl. malioboro nya ditutup untuk kendaraan, mungkin perlu jadi bahan pertimbangan (walaupun ada jalan alternative dan easy to reach as well). By overall, for sure will come back again to Novotel suites once coming to Jogja! Thanks and cheers ❤️"

"597.","Ali Lukman Assegaf","103","2024-01-07","2","Aah.. What an awful hotel even though located in such a strategic spot near Malioboro. First, poorly equipped gym with only one from two functional treadmill. Second, weird room layout with minimum amenities. Third, buffet on breakfast and lunch with too simple meal selections. In conclusion, it's a four stars hotel with the feel of two stars."
"598.","Dass","42","2025-01-07","5","To the GM of Novotel Yogyakarta: My wife and I stayed for 7N at Novotel Yogyakarta. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary. Although things were not quite to our satisfaction at first, we ended our stay very well and it's all thanks to two managers who were exceptionally helpful. Mr Windhu helped us at the start and Ms Fitria Ariani (@Ms AI) subsequently took over that duty. We want to commend Novotel for their excellent choice of hires of these two wonderful managers. Mr Windhu was very empathetic when we voiced our unhappiness. As the manager in charge, we could sense his willingness and helpfulness to assist us in making things right for us, instead of just trivializing our unhappiness. Ms AI who took over our case ensured that our every little need was met from the time she took over until the time when we left the hotel. Her special attention to us made us feel like we were VVVIPs and it really touched our hearts how she would go out of her way to ensure that we had the best remaining stay in Novotel. Both Mr Windhu and Ms AI went way and above their call of duties to make our stay at Novotel Yogyakarta a truly memorable one. We are grateful to God to have met these two angels who have made our stay so pleasant. Their commitment to their jobs is absolutely commendable. They are the kind of role model managers to all their staff and they should be promoted when a position is available. Novotel should retain them as much as possible as they are BIG assets to Novotel. In a nutshell, we think that Novotel can be that brilliant first choice hotel for anyone if Novotel were to pay a bit more attention to the cleanliness state of the room, the breakfast served as well as the massage services. Novotel Yogyakarta already has very good location, very helpful staff and coupled with these two angelic managers, Novotel is not very far off from being one of the best hotels in Yogyakarta if they would just work on these areas of improvement. In conclusion, we would like to offer our deepest thanks to Ms AI, Mr Windhu and all that friendly Novotel staff for all the help rendered to us. We truly appreciate it. May god bless you all!"

"600.","Ineke Gunawan","159","2022-01-07","5","Menginap disini 4hari pada saat masa pandemi ternyata nyaman sekali. Pelayanan novotel suites sangat2 menjalankan protokol kesehatan dg ketat. Mulai dari parkiran yg sangat baik pelayanannya, dari masuk sampai akan keluar hotel, benar2 dibimbing sampai ke parkiran / keluar hotel. Pelayanan kamar sgt baiiikk, kamar bersih. Fasilitas kamar & hotel nilai 9,9 👍🏻 Benar2 sangat nyaman. Menginap 4hr dg paket BF, menurut saya masih perlu peningkatan pada menu & rasa pd resto karena masih kurang sesuai dg hotel sekelas novotel suites. Dan harga untuk makan di resto pun terbilang pricey. Yaaah kalau dr 5bintang, saya kasi 3 ya. Tp pelayanan hotel, kebersihan, keramahan, kecakapan nilai 9,9."

On the other hand, the cocktails were delicious and we were attended by the bartender Reza and the a waiter Hom (I’m not sure about his name), both gave us a personalized and friendly attention, in addition the cocktails and wine were delicious.

Saya ada tertinggal barang di hotel, dan saya kontak kepada petugas terkait supaya tolong dikeep sementara karena akan ada rekan saya yg akan mengambil barang saya yg tertinggal tsb. Saya sudah ingatkan berkali-kali agar dikeep dengan baik. Harusnya saat didatangi oleh rekan saya normalnya barang sudah dikeep dengan aman dan tersedia dong. Bahkan dokumentasi barangnya yg tertinggal seperti apa sudah diketahui oleh pihak hotel. Namun anehnya saat didatangi oleh rekan saya, barang statusnya malah masih dicari, rekan saya kabarnya sudah cukup lama menunggu petugas mencari dan harus segera meninggalkan hotel karena keburu jadwal keberangkatan kereta. Disini pertanyaan saya adalah 1. Apakah tidak ada komunikasi yg baik antar petugas yg berjaga secara shift terkait barang tertinggal yg sudah dipesankan sebelumnya oleh customer? 2. Apakah penanganan lost & found ini benar-benar serius ditanggapi oleh pihak hotel? Saya sudah berpesan dan mengingatkan pihak hotel supaya barang tsb dikeep dengan baik. Tanpa harus dijelaskan dengan detail rasanya hotel sekelas Novotel sudah tau tentang hal begini Jujur saya kecewa dengan penanganan lost & found di hotel ini 🤦‍♂️"

Pd saat mau pulang, hendak bayar parkir ke receptionist Novotel diminta biaya 50.000 utk parkir oleh Security bernama NUGROHO. Dan dengan ngotot ala jawa nya, berkeras bahwa kami sudah diinfo 50.000 utk biaya parkir. Yang mana kami bertemu 3 security, tidak ada yg menjelaskan di awal utk ongkos parkir 50.000 Hanya bilang, parkir hanya utk tamu hotel dan tdk ada omongan 50.000 , dan diinfo nanti kalau gitu biaya parkir ke mba receptionist langsung. Sangat disayangkan sekali hotel sekelas Novotel dicemarkan oleh sikap security yang ngotot ke customer soal parkir 50rb dibandingkan berapa nilai yg customer akan keluarkan 2.8jt utk nginep semalam. Nilai yg jauh sekali hanya krn kami merasa ditagih 50rb nilai kecil tapi tidak Fair, sehingga menyebabkan kami sudah tidak punya selera utk mencoba Novotel Malioboro !!! Pihak management Novotel tolong diperbaiki sistem pengelolaan securitynya. Tidak seperti itu cara menghadapi customer dan tidak mencerminkan KELAS hotel jaringan internasional !"

"687.","Nandi Bagus","24","2025-01-14","1","Pengalaman Sangat Buruk Pertama kali saya alami saat menginap di hotel Novotel Suites Mallioboro. Saya menginap 13 juli 2024 dan memilih hotel ini karena sangat dekat dengan tempat saya beracara di tanggal 14 Juli 2024 jam 04.00 meskipun sebenarnya dalam proses pemesanan hotel Juga mengalami kendala dan ketidaknyamanannya. Saya tidak akan membahas mengenai hal tersebut namun hal yang membuat saya marah, kecewa dengan pelayanan yang diberikan sekelas hotel Bintang 4 ini. Tanggal 14 Juli 2024 saya keluar dari kamar untuk aktivitas jam 04.00, posisi barang-barang pribadi saya rapikan dan dimasukan ke dalam koper dan tertinggal perlengkapan mandi di kamar mandi. Selesai aktivitas jam 09.00 saya kembali ke hotel dan langsung menuju tempat breakfast. Sekitar pukul 09.30 saya kembali menuju kamar dan betapa terkejutnya saya bahwa kamar saya dalam kondisi terbuka, selimut, bed cover sudah dalam kondisi tidak di tempat tidur. Padahal saya saat itu belum cek out dan tidak ada konfirmasi ke saya dari pihak hotel bahwa saya sudah cek out atau belum. Saya kemudian langsung cek koper, dan masih beruntung ternyata koper dan barang berharga masih tertinggal di kamar. Bagaimana hal ini bisa terjadi sekelas hotel Bintang 4?? Saat cek out saya menemui Pak Sapto, duty manager saat itu. Beliau menyampaikan permintaan maaf dengan alasan crew dilapangan salah dengar instruksi dari FO terkait kamar cek out yang seharusnya kamar 811 menjadi 911. Sebenarnya bagi saya itu bukan alasan yang masuk akal untuk hotel sekelas Novotel yang dalam pikiran saya tiap lantai pastinya ada PIC yang bertugas masing-masing. Pada dasarnya saya tidak mau memperpanjang hal ini, pada saat itu juga saya tidak meminta kompensasi apa-apa. Hanya saya minta ke Pak Sapto untuk membuat permintaan maaf tertulis dan disampaikan segera ke email saya. Saya beri waktu di hari senin, namun mungkin saya terlalu berekspektasi terlalu tinggi terhadap ketulusan hotel ini meminta maaf. Sampai hari selasa sore tanggal 16 Juli 2024 dimana ulasan ini saya tulis, surat tersebut belum saya terima. Sungguh pelayanan dan handling customer yang sangat buruk dari hotel ini, kalau bukan dekat dengan tempat acara pasti saya memilih hotel lain yang hospitality jauh lebih baik dari hotel ini."

"689.","Marya","170","2024-01-14","1","I don't think I've ever been so disappointed to turn my room key and walk into a hotel room. It's like a small monochromatic, grey cave. The room smells like smoke and off gassing. It wasn't clean, though I saw the cleaning guy (just one guy) working hard and I don't want to fault him. He was very kind and friendly. There was pubic hair on my bed, hair in the shower, the surfaces aren't clean and the light switches were so dirty I had to wipe them off before I'd use them. One window doesn't shut so it's hot and loud and smelly. I didn't ask to change rooms because I thought the open window might help with the offgassing a bit. We wanted to use the pool but there were kids swimming without diapers. The hotel caters to kids, not adult or business travelers. At breakfast there were plates of donuts and sugary things and the many, many kids loved them. I ate fruit. The gym is small and the equipment is mostly broken. For the price, I expected far more. This should be a 2 star hotel."

"709.","Fransisca Amelia Mulyadi","18","2023-01-14","1","We had a really bad experience with the check in process during our holiday in Novotel Suites Malioboro in mid December 2022. We booked two superior studio with king size bed for two nights from Traveloka application, with special request of connecting rooms as we were travelling with 3 kids. Upon check in, the front desk staff Ibu Uci said that Novotel could not provide connecting rooms because there were NO RECORDS in Novotel system about the special request of connecting rooms. We then quickly called Traveloka to confirm that we DID made the special request of connecting rooms. Traveloka said YES - my request was recorded in their database. In fact we were travelling in 5 different cities staying in 5 different 4 to 5 stars hotels and all EXCEPT NOVOTEL could get the correct request and all EXCEPT NOVOTEL could provide their best effort to provide two rooms next to each other if connecting rooms were not available. We fully understand that connecting rooms were subject to availability but strangely NOVOTEL insisted that because Novotel system did not get any information from Traveloka (while Traveloka already said the opposite) the attitude of the front desk was stiff and boastful as if she was trying to say - hey you customer, novotel is the correct one, customer should do as what Novotel system says. Even when we asked for the connecting rooms for the second night, the same front desk staff - Ibu Uci - with stony face said “they are all full, no connecting rooms for the second night”. Only after we asked to meet with the manager - Ibu Fitria- and we were showing frustration over bad handling of customer complaint, finally Ibu Uci said that they can provide the connecting rooms for the second night. We thought that Accor Hotel chains supposed to have one of the best information system but this experience proof us wrong. We would think again a million times if we would have to stay in one of the Accor hotel chain again, fearing that the bad experiences like this would happen again."

Saat complain soal kulkas tdk dingin ke bagian guest service mrk bilang akan send tehnisi ke kamar untuk mengecek, tapi ditunggu 1 jam tidak ada yang datang.. saat langsung lapor ke reception mereka bilang kulkas memang hanya display saja memang tidak dingin 😂 lalu apabila saya beli makan atau minum dari luar bisa titip di staff hotel, jujur baru pertama saya dengar komen semacam itu, aneh! 5.

Kami tiba di hotel pukul 15.30, artinya sudah melebihi jam check in, tapi saat akan check in, ternyata beberapa kamar belum ready entah apa alasannya, sehingga saya dan rombongan harus menunggu sampai pukul 16.30. Padahal kami sudah melakukan booking kamar jauh2 hari dan sudah melakukan pembayaran. Untuk sekelas hotel bintang 4, saya rasa ini sangat tidak profesional. Untuk lokasi sangat strategis, dekat dengan malioboro & pusat keramaian. Untuk kamar, kebetulan kamar yang saya tempati, exhaust fan untuk toilet tidak berfungsi, juga kran shower bocor. Semoga kedepannya pelayanan terkait front office bisa lebih baik lagi."

Sarapan ok, fasilitas ok, lokasi strategis dan dekat dengan malioboro Hal yang jadi concern saya adalah dari segi housekeeping nya 1. Sabun dari awal saya datang (saya stay selama 4 hari) sabun dalam kondisi hampir habis dan baru di refill di hari ke empat itupun setelah saya minta 2. Saya ga tau kamar dibersihkan secara detail atau nggak. Dibawah kolong tempat tidur ada bekas buah yang dimainin anak saya dari hari pertama dateng sampai pulang gak di cleanup 3. Ada benda yang terbuang oleh housekeeping padahal benda itu sangat penting dan berharga untuk anak saya karena jadi benda kesayangan nya, padahal posisi benda tersebut diletakkkan di tempat yang tidak seharusnya dibersihkan terlebih lagi dibuang. Harapannya dapat dijadikan masukan bagi team housekeeping untuk lebih teliti dan berhati2"

Still can't sleep from the itch 3 days later and had to treat my luggage and all my items carefully, hoping not to bring the problem back with me. It's a true inconvenience! Service was good and polite at check in but at check out, they looked at the red bites and asked if I was having an allergy! That brought down the rating. Location is good, just off Malioboro street, but frankly, will trade off location for a cleaner place. Never again!"

"747.","Wahyu Jati","73","2024-01-14","2","review jujur pengalaman iftar disini, semoga bisa menjadi perhatian pihak manajemen hotel, waktu liat postingan di ig ada 2 pilihan venue iftar dengan harga yg berbeda, ternyata pas WA admin diinfokan bahwa ada update harga dan venue hanya di resto karena cuaca sedang tidak mendukung kalau di poolbar. Diinfo kalau ready jam 17.00, pas sudah sampai resto ternyata diarahkan menuju poolbar karena disana juga sudah disiapkan, katanya menunya juga lebih komplit dan staff yang bertugas menginfokan kalau iftar di resto sebenarnya cuma 155k (udah beda info dengan admin WA), okelah kita menuju poolbar, udah jam 17.00 lebih dan sampai menjelang berbuka puasa, staff yang ada masih sibuk nyiapin venue sama makanan, padahal katanya jam 17.00 udah siap, mungkin karena itu juga sampai menjelang berbuka puasa belum pada ambil makanan, sungkan kali yaa, makanan masih belum dibuka, masih terbungkus plastik wrap, malahan saya sampai sempet buka plastik wrap bumbu siomay nya sendiri lhoo, mana gak ada saos/kecapnya, jadi staff yang bertugas di stall makanannya itu terbatas banget, stall nasi bryani-roast chicken-rib-sei yang jaga cuma 1 orang sampe kerepotan banget, ntah itu masnya sempet istirahat gak, kasian juga. jam 18.30 udah banyak makanan yang habis sampe ditinggal sholat maghrib/isya pas kembali masih belum di refill juga. jadi kesannya all you can eat tapi gak ada yang di eat. akhirnya si iga nya di refill tapi ternyata pas dimakan masih dingin (bukan dingin suhu ruangan, tapi kayak baru keluar dari freezer), untuk rasa dan varian B aja sih, gak nemu yg istimewa, sei nya keras banget, menu unggulan iga dan scallop gak memuaskan, malahan aneka cake yang biasanya ada tapi gak ada, cuman jajanan pasar aja. oiyaa satu lagi, pliss laahh mosok hotel suites pakainya wadah makan-minum plastik/kertas sekali pakai, udah macam kayak di street food aja, di review sebelumnya udah ada yang nulis tapi masih sama gitu juga gak ada pembenahan. dengan rates harga dan embel-embel suites nya cukup membuat kecewa sih, nilai plusnya cuman karena dapet venue di rooftop dan kebetulan cerah aja."

Iga bakar kehabisan terus wkwk giliran dapet malah yg masih frozen, jd iga bakar rasa es :( kue kuenya, cuma menu jajanan pasar kah ? gaada chocolate cake, cheese cake dan sejenisnya (itu sih yg saya bayangkan). jujur agak kecewa sih, maaf yaa.

"749.","Listya Nugrahsari","10","2024-01-14","2","I checked for 3 days and 2nights. A night before check out, I came to the front desk and asked for a late check-out. The assigned staff immediately granted to get the late check-out until 1300. Tomorrow morning around 11:30, I was informed by a call to the room that I needed to extend the key card to enable getting the access. My concern is if the late check out has been confirmed a night before; and especially the confirmation is immediately made by a walk-in to the front desk, the hotel staff should have confirmed this immediately by the time guest heard directly from the hotel staff. It’s super ineffective to go back again the day after just to extend the key card. The hotel system is created by human so everything can be actually adjusted. Please provide white bright towels in the room. You have very shadowed towels and unbright white towels for guests. Please be mindful since nobody wants to apply/rub your unbright-shadowed white colored towels with that condition. The hanger can not be taken out from the cabinet. I don’t want to take it as a souvenir, but it’s so difficult to hang clothes/ items if you install the hangers. The hotel has changed the laundry bag to the laundry big box which is so inefficient for guests. If you don’t want the laundry bag is always missing after the guests check out, apply the charges on that just like you charge the third mineral water bottle in the room."
"750.","S D'Cruz","4","2025-01-14","2","I booked 2 rooms (1 via Agoda and 1 direct). The website described a sofa bed in the superior studio king or twin beds room, but it doesn't function as a sofa bed. When I asked, the receptionist explained that only the room with the king-size bed has the sofa bed. Seriously? I was so disappointed, and the hotel even had the cheek to want to charge an additional Rp450,000 for an extra bed. If it weren't for the friendliness of the staff and their willingness to do their utmost for you, I would have given a 1-star rating. Red and brown stains on the bed linen are not acceptable. The fridge in the room does not function properly (for display purposes only, according to the receptionist). Upon check-in, the facility, breakfast time, and Accor Loyalty Membership were not explained. I only found out about the Accor member benefits when paying for drinks at the pool bar, and when I came down to reception to claim the points, they said only the room booked directly with the hotel can claim points. Information on TV does not work properly - all gimmicky. The TV and hairdryer stopped working - I had to call an engineer. The hairdryer in the room does not work at all. Claiming to be a 4-star hotel but using shampoo/soap dispenser in the shower that doesn't function properly, and I had to ask the engineer to remove the bottles from the bracket so I could use the shampoo and soap. No small towels were provided in both rooms on arrival. The next day, only 1 room was given small towels. Tissues had a funny smell as they are kept in a leather-like box. Not sure how long they have been in there. My credit card was charged before I arrived at the hotel, and I had to contact my bank to ensure the refund was processed immediately. Considering I made many calls to Reception to report the issues, nobody from management offered acknowledgement. No management in sight during our stay (16 & 17 April 2024). Good location in the center of Malioboro - other than that, I am not sure if it is worth the money."

Hanya yg bermasalah security yg sombong arogan tak ber etika dalam berbicara ke tamu, pintar berbohong dan memilih milih tamu untuk bisa mendapatkan Parkir di depan lobby. Untuk restoran ditingkatkan untuk tasty breakfast petugas staf staf di tempat breakfast bisa lebih ramah ke semua tamu, Para karyawan di restoran breakfast agar wajahnya ditambah senyuman jangan kelihatan kayak wajah murung kayak dibawah tekanan kerja. Ramahnya jangan milih milih tamu ya, yang saya lihat dengan mata kepala sendiri dilokasi yang ditanyain mau minum apa oleh waitress2 nya hanya tamu2 yang khusus sekitar 2 sampai 6 orang selebihnya tidak disapa bahkan tidak ditanyakan mau minum apa. Saya tamu loyal member accor platinum tidak ada apresiasi di hotel Novotel suite Yogya. Bahkan minta sepotong Jahe iris untuk nge teh aja harus memohon dan itupun dibilang Jahe habis dan harus bayar extra lagi di cafe rooftop. Dan akhirnya dikasih setelah saya katakan apakah Main kitchen masak makanan tidak pakai jahe. Semua ukuran berbayar. Mau minjem tambahan bantal dan selimut pun tadinya disuruh bayar dan saya bilang oke saya bayar berapa dan akhirnya dibilang tanya ke atasannya dulu berapa bayarnya, tiba tiba diinfo ga usah bayar. Baru kali ini nemu hotel member accor yang model begini . MOHON DIPERBAIKI attitude karyawan staf lapangannya. Kalo ada tarif tarif tambahan mohon dicantumkan dengan jelas.

Stayed at end of Mei in new Novotel Yogyakarta, i found my room smell smoke/cigarette. I called downstair and asked the receptionist to move. They told me that my room is indeed non-smoking room but they couldn't prevent if someone smoked at my room before (i guess you have smoke detector, right? Isn't it work?). They said they can not guarantee if bad smell still occur in other room too if they move me. Actually before put my complain, i found that my trash bin was full of cigarettes which also made me questioning the cleaning standard. In the morning i had a bad cough and my shirt smell like cigarette. When i check out i was asked whether i have complain and i mentioned my issue, but no compliment word were given nor any sorry. This is an experience which i never had in old Novotel jalan Sudirman or other Accor group hotels around Yogyakarta. Typically any other hotel will charge stayer for 1-2 millions if they found out stayer smoking in non-smoking room, but it seems that's not happen in here. Uniquely i also found the same review about bad cigarette smell in the room of Novotel Yogyakarta 3 months ago in the 1-star review 🥲"

Besides that isssue, we had some hygenic issues as well, We complained the next day and the front desk manager officially apologize and offered us another room, but when we checked in the room in the evening, we found out that the bed sheet had a big yellowish stain, plus my wife had another itchy blister in the next morning. 2. Had few times difficulties to get out from parking fl where i had to opened the barricade gate by my self and there were no securities available to guide way up on a two way parking ramp, and to make it worst I ended up face to face at the ramp with a motor bike which went down direction. 3. During our last night, the security guided me to park at B level due to fully parking spaces, but in the morning when i wanted to check out, i was shock that the space i parked was the mall parking space and my car was surrounded by motorbikes and barely could get out if the mall parking guy didn't help me.

"783.","Matt Koenig","24","2023-01-14","3","We stayed 4 nights at Novotel Suites Yogyakarta Malioboro in the Superior Studio room with a King sized bed. This is a hotel that was built in 1997 and last renovated in 2019 so we were a little surprised by the condition of the hotel and the room. Check-in was easy and the front desk staff were all very friendly and helpful (5 stars for all the staff). The room was very spacious and the bed was comfortable. We had a view of the city which was nice. The bathroom had a weird layout which didn’t work well. But the biggest complaint was the mold in the corner of the room near the shower and along the edges of the carpet. Other aspects of the room seemed dated as well. The walls between room seem very thin and you can often hear your neighbors or sounds from the hallway. Overall the hotel seemed very dated for one that had supposedly been renovated in 2019. Our room included a breakfast which was buffet style and located on the 8th floor. Unfortunately this is also the smoking floor so when you get off the elevator for breakfast you are confronted with the smell of cigarette smoke. You get used to it in Indonesia but still I think maybe the smoking rooms should be on a different floor for those sensitive to the smell of smoke. The buffet breakfast was excellent (5 stars for the food and staff). Lots of options from traditional Indonesian dishes to Western food and a large dining area with outside seating for those that smoke and eat. Bayu was great at making omelets and the rest of the staff were also very friendly and helpful. Made in particular was super helpful and provided great service. The drop off and pickup point of the hotel is odd. There is only a single way in and out so your driver has to turn around to go back out the same way and it’s quite tight especially when busy. The best part of this hotel is the location to Malioboro street. You are literally right there and can enjoy the shops, restaurants and sights easily by foot. There is a shopping mall right there and oddly a disconnected mall on several of the lower floors of the hotel itself (Malioboro Mall). We stumbled upon it by accident and access seems to have been limited (closed off to the main mall) which unfortunately has affected all the businesses at this location. Overall it was an OK stay and every staff member that we encountered was always super friendly and helpful. I’d probably stay here again just for the great location to Malioboro street and all the activities there but my wife said she would not stay here again."

The room was comfortable enough, however the walls are thin, you will hear people talking in the corridor or the room next door. One most annoying thing is that during my stay the security at the front door always ask me my room number every time I entered the hotel, I wonder if they ask everyone or just me ? Room number is guest privacy, an international chain hotel should be aware of that. But the staff are very attentive and polite. If you want to stay in a practical hotel just to spend the night after a busy day outside, then this is the place. But if you need a hotel that can feels at home, look elsewhere."

"793.","JN Indrawan","32","2022-01-14","3","Before I arrived the hotel contacted me via whatsapp asking my arrival time and I thought this was a good gesture. The check-in process went well, and I was very happy to be done at the priority check-in desk. (Many of Accor's hotel priority check-in desks are currently not working, even before the Pandemic, so I as a platinum member are not satisfied with this situation.) Road access (for car) is a bit problematic, because Malioboro street is closed between 6 pm - 9 pm or 10 pm and alternative road access is being repaired. However, if you are a hotel guest, you can still access via Malioboro st. during this period with a password, although it is a bit inconvenient as traffic to Malioboro is congested and you need to speak to the police/street officer. The location itself is very strategic, a few steps to Jalan Malioboro, connected to a mall and in the same complex as the Ibis Hotel. I got an upgrade to the executive room (I'm platinum member) and the room was spacious but had no view and the ac didn't work well, so they moved me to a junior suite which I think, even though it's one category under the executive room, it's better. This is due to the fact that the room has a window with a view (though not the best view). in the room there is a mini pantry where a chiller, coffee maker and microwave are available. Moreover, the bathroom in the executive room is small when compared to the junior suite room, even in the junior suite room there is a bathtub. However the cleanliness of the duvet needs to be improved because it was full of old stains, it's a shame because the hotel is not even (seemingly) 3 years old. The wifi is bad but luckily the cellphone signal from the room is quite good. The tv program is good enough, there are some of my favorite channels too. Many choices of breakfast but the taste in my opinion is mediocre. Furthermore, I don't like the treatment one of the restaurant attendant who told me to wear gloves even though I wasn't taking food and only talked to the noodle station chef to place an order. The strange thing was that there were other hotel guests coughing in front of the food and some who don't wear masks when taking food but are not reprimanded by the staff. Gym is too small and very little equipment. the pool is nice but I saw it was packed when they actually have a (if i don't mistaken) no more than 10 person rule during the pandemic. They have a bar on the rooftop but unfortunately the view focuses on the swimming pool, it's a shame it should have been designed by optimizing the view to the city."

"795.","Rudy Franto Manik","18","2025-01-14","3","Compared to some hotels around Malioboro, this hotel is considered pricy, at least to what I paid (IDR 1,3 mio - RO). I had 2 bath towels in the room with no face towel, hand towel, or bath mat which made the bathroom a bit messy. I am going to Jogja again this weekend (2-4 Feb), but intentionally, I chose another hotel. Not sure what the benefits of part of ALL Accor member for years are."
"796.","rafiudin fatulhaj","21","2022-01-14","3","Penanganan dalam melayani service customer sangat lah buruk. 1.pimpinan saya komplain dikarenakan tidak bisa akses masuk ke kamar tidak dilayani dengan baik. 2. Ketika pimpinan saya komplain mereka malah memarahi pimpinan saya bukannya menyelesaikan masalahnya mereka malah meninggalkan permasalahan tsb dan dibiarkan pimpinan saya menunggu di ruang lobby. 3. Miss komunikasi antara pegawai shift pagi dengan yang malam sehingga ktika kami cek in masih ada kamar yang diisi oleh customer lain. 4. Dari segi makanan cukup enak namun segi pelayanan kurang cepat tanggap dan lama 5. Fasilitas oke, tapi hanya satu yang kurang tidak diberikan masker gratis di kamar 6. Saya pesen makanan untuk di take away dikarenakan saya ada jam penerbangan pulang pagi, namun pesenan saya malah tidak sesuai."

"798.","fachrul azwi","50","2023-01-14","3","Hotel sangat nyaman, lokasi strategis.. Tp desain pintu kamar mandi nya bermasalah, krn orang yg di pintu kamar bisa lihat ke dalam kamar mandi tertutup melalui pantulan cermin... Dan sangat tidak direkomendasikan bagi pelaku perjalanan dinas atau yg pembayaran nya corporate, krn 7 hari menginap dsini nyaris setiap hari sy ditanya pembayaran, pdhl sudah sy jelaskan berulang2 pemesanan nya melalui corporate, pembayaran nya corporate jg.."
"799.","Abraham Wicaksono","58","2023-01-14","3","This hotel is quite expensive, not a good value for their room.. this place is expensive because of their location is in the middle of malioboro street.. room pretty much standard like other hotel room but their tv is huge! 55 inch samsung tv.. down side is their restaurant located at 8th floor, which is smoking guest room, so when we going to 8th floor it smell like cigarretes everywhere.. room are not so clean. If you want the location just get ibis or other hotel near here.. price are not worth it for their facilities or their room..you can get marriot room with bathtub and bigger room and pool for the same price.."

"801.","Fish Hamburger","210","2021-01-14","3","Nginep 2 malam dlm masa pandemi dihabiskan lbh banyak di hotel, sayang layanan internet lemot dan sering loading. Harusnya itu sdh bisa diantisipasi pihak hotel ketika hunian peak, sehingga mgkin ada plan lain bila hal tsb tjd."
"802.","Kirana","119","2021-01-14","3","Kurang nyaman dengan keramahannya bgitu mau masuk langsung ditanya satpam, mau kemana? Dgn nada kurang sopan. Adek mau masuk padahal sudah inhouse disana 3 malam ditanya mau jemput siapa? Sangat tidak nyaman... Mungkin perlu ditraining dengan kata yg lebih sopan seperti, selamat pagi/siang/malam, apakah bisa dibantu?"

"804.","ade subhan","879","2020-01-14","3","This is new hotel behind malioboro shopping mall, and very closed to the famous street in Jogja, Jalan Malioboro. The hotel was good and clean, but to reach this area quiet though, especially on the weekend or holiday seasson, not only when you are driving, but also when you ordered a online cab or bike rides. The have direct access to the shopping mall and atm centre from upper level."

Suatu malam, saya merasa lelah, jadi saya memesan layanan kamar melalui WhatsApp, tetapi tidak ada respons untuk beberapa saat. Akhirnya, saya naik ke restoran di lantai 8 dan memesan sup. Menunya menyebutkan sup buntut, tetapi mereka membawakan saya sup galbi, mirip dengan galbitang. Dagingnya agak kenyal, jadi agak sulit dimakan, tetapi secara keseluruhan, makanannya enak."

Sayangnya, staf resepsionis tidak dapat membantu kami mengatur tur ke kuil-kuil terdekat. Bar di atap dengan kolam renang sejauh ini menjadi daya tarik utama, tetapi berdasarkan pengalaman kami, hal itu tidak sulit..."
