"1.","Tamarua Marsters","3","2025-12-09","5","I spent my last couple of days at Voco Seminyak before graduating to a IHG Gold member! How fitting as Voco also celebrates their 1 year anniversary!. The hotel is a IHG partner so really good for IHG members. The hotel is in a really good location close to all the popular eating and clubbing spots in Seminyak. The hotel still feels very clean be the decor is crazy good! The service was exceptional from the security staff to the reception team right through to house keeping and the restaurant crew. We were looked after by Oscar and his team at reception who were always so nice to us and also the lovely ladies in the restaurant. The rooms are exactly like the images and the beds were the comfiest we experienced during our stay in Bali. I’d highly recommend Voco"
"2.","Hira Tariq","24","2026-01-02","4","Very close to Seminyak Square, around 15 mins walk. Hotel is good, worth 4 stars. All the basic amenities are available in the hotel. However, pool timings are 7am to 7 pm and the dinner option displayed on booking.com is misleading. We made our booking through booking.com and booked for full course, they offered very limited snack options for the dinner. We argued a little and the manager was kind enough to get our main course changed from the pre-set menu. Overall, it was a good and comfortable stay at Voco Seminyak."

Loved the Caesar salad from dinner and the fresh juices on the menu. Matur Suksma to the amazing staff that looked after us. Oscar and the ladies from reception and the lovely restaurant team🩷 And a special thank you to the staff that fished my phone out of the elevator chute! Exceptional service!"
"4.","Ryan","5","2025-11-09","2","While I understand that this is not a 5-Star hotel, the hygiene standard for IHG Group Hotel should not be as low as what I felt when staying in Voco Bali Seminyak nonetheless. Fairly speaking, the room is quite spacious and stylish, despite that the low-ceiling it comes with making it smaller in size. The front office attendants are so friendly and accommodating, feeling like I was warmly welcomed home. The cookies and complimentary welcome drink given made the experience better. As this is my first time staying in IHG Group hotel as the new member (I stayed in VOCO Riyadh as guest before), I decided to not taking any expectations as I usually stay in either Marriott or Accor Group hotels which offering quite a decent experience regardless for its solely 4-Star hotel. Upon check in for my first room, turns out I was disappointed as the hygiene standard were dropping so bad compared to its other competitor or the one which I stayed back in Riyadh for the same rate, especially for the bathroom itself where I found a lot of hairs, dusts, and stains near the bathtub as showed in the video attached. I complained two times, yet finally they came to only give me the complementary fruits as their “sorry” and pretend it would solve everything without even checking inside the toilet (they did not come the first time I called), and yet I call the last time to let them know for at least checking in the toilet first while finally they changed me to a new room after almost 1 hour of waiting with slightly better condition. I truly understand that this is a newly built hotel and maybe needs some improvements, but isn’t it supposed to be great so people would come back to stay? Therefore, the verdict would be disappointed for overall segments, and I would less likely to return back to any of IHG Hotels for my upcoming stays, unless there would be any progressive improvement coming from the management and a “decent” apologizing paper rather than sending out the fruit and saying sorry itself. I am so sure that 4-star hotel from Marriott and Accor (let’s say Novotel) will handle this issue better than this."

Staff was very helpful our especial thanks to Ms. Novita and her team for making our stay so comfortable. They were kind enough to provide us with takeaway breakfast as we had to catch early flight. Thank you Voco for your hospitality."
"6.","Billy Lam","27","2025-10-09","5","My wife found this place online by chance. We decided to go for it. Stayed for 4 nights, dulex room (king size). The room is pretty spacious and squeaky clean. The location is fantastic - lots of dining options all around. Don't need to book a grab/gojek. Just walk around which suits me alot. Overall the experience has been joyful. Not much folks uses the pool. Feels like a private pool for us 😂 The staffs are sweet and welcoming. If you are planning to stay in Seminyak, this is a good option. Not too far away from the crowd, but away from the noise"
"7.","Aditya","10","2025-12-09","5","If you're staying in Seminyak, go with Voco! The hotel is really fresh and modern, and the rooms are designed perfectly, super clean and comfortable. The central courtyard and pool area are great for unwinding after a day out. The staff were all so lovely and easy to deal with, making everything about our check in and stay smooth. Loved it here!"
"8.","Sara Hakeem","22","2025-09-09","5","Great stay at VOCO. Amazing staff, friendly and welcoming always. They insist on helping us in everything, from recommendations to booking and alternative plans. Rooms are clean and spacious. Pool is lovely, warm and clean. Cozy atmosphere the music in the eating area is lovely. The security guards will always assist you in crossing the road when traffic. In our last day they send us off with a nice cake. Definitely recommend."
"9.","Peggy Santosa","21","2025-08-09","3","A Clean, Comfy, No-Fuss Stay Not much to rave about — but also nothing to complain about. Voco delivers exactly what it promises: a clean, comfortable, standard stay at decent value (at least when we booked). 🛏️ The room: Clean, quiet, and comfy — perfect for a solo traveler or a couple needing a short city stop. Nothing fancy, but everything works. 🍳 Breakfast: Limited selection, so don’t expect a breakfast buffet extravaganza. It gets the job done, but that’s about it. 📍 Location: A solid plus. Walkable to nearby cafes, shops, and amenities. If you’re planning to explore the area on foot, you’re well-placed. 🙋‍♀️ Service: Professional and polite.. just… standard. Which sometimes is all you need. ✅ Recommended? Yes — for solo travelers or couples wanting a no-frills, short stay. No — for families with children. While the location is okay, there are many better family-friendly options nearby with more space, activities, or amenities for kids."
"10.","Hannah M","31","2026-01-02","1","Serious…? This is after the cleaning. They put too much effort to inside out the linen instead of changing. Never seen any hotels doing this. I was so happy with the room how it was spacious and modern. Cleaning service let everything down."
"11.","Monaries","93","2025-07-09","5","I love how bright and spacious the room and bathroom are, but this hotel does not feel ready to cater to the market yet. Many of their rooms are still not saleable to patrons, and I stayed in the 1st floor of the odd numbers corridor, i saw many room doors were opened and left as such throughout my 2-nights stay. Much gratitude to Mr Arya and Ms Novita for trying their best to ensure i have a comfortable stay. 💡some tips: - request for room nearest to the elevator because the corridor is long and can be quite dark in the evening - there are limited parking on site, so if you come with a car, might want to arrange/ ask the hotel first - if you are planning to book for a longer stay, please read the other reviews, especially the 3 or 4 stars ones, some of them give useful hindsight UPDATES: Stayed here again for 1 night, came last minute, was given a room rightaway, and when i enter the room, the room was cold, there were welcome letter and some fruits on the table. Appreciate the promptness, and very warm welcome received👍🏻. Significant improvements were noticed, the hallway are much brighter, the floors are no longer dusty and dirty. There is still room for improvement, but really appreciate the hotel team's effort thus far. Again, grateful for Ms. Novita for arranging a room for me at the very last minute, and for Mr. Arya and the rest of the team for their wholesome service. Matur suksma🙏🏻"

"13.","Andre Bella","118","2025-07-09","5","A Perfect Oasis in the Heart of the City! This 5-star hotel truly delivers on every front, making it an absolute standout! From the moment you arrive, the staff is simply amazing, always attentive and ready to assist with a genuine smile. The hotel itself is beautifully decorated, exuding an air of elegance and sophistication that makes every moment of your stay feel luxurious. What's more, the entire property is immaculately clean, a detail that truly enhances the comfort and peace of mind during your visit. One of the highlights of my stays is undoubtedly the breakfast experience. I always look forward to waking up and heading down for their spread. The coffee is consistently excellent, providing the perfect start to the day, and their omelets are incredibly delicious – cooked exactly to your liking. The hotel's location is superb, placing you within easy reach of everything. It's a breeze to walk to various restaurants and explore the surrounding area. Despite being in a very touristy district, the hotel manages to be super quiet, offering a serene retreat from the bustling streets. This perfect balance of accessibility and tranquility truly sets it apart. For a truly exceptional and relaxing stay, this hotel comes with my highest recommendation!"
"14.","Brown Gee","14","2025-08-09","5","Voco Bali Seminyak Absolutely wonderful experience! The hotel offers top-notch quality with a stylish and comfortable atmosphere. The staff were incredibly warm, friendly, and genuinely caring they made us feel right at home from the moment we arrived. The customer service was truly outstanding, always going the extra mile to ensure our comfort. I thoroughly enjoyed the delicious and diverse breakfast options every morning, and the cleanliness of the entire property was impeccable. Every detail was thoughtfully taken care of, from room service to amenities. Their hospitality and attention to detail made our stay unforgettable. I would definitely recommend Voco Bali Seminyak to anyone visiting Bali an excellent choice for comfort, service, and a welcoming vibe!"
"15.","YZ December S","5","2025-09-09","1","I had one of the worst hotel experience from a brand hotel. 1. We arrived at 130am, with our infant and saw dodgy looking, noisy men loitering in the lobby. There was even a call girl person dressed scantily talking at her top of her voice (clearly there for some night business). There was only 1 staff member managing the front desk and he was clearly struggling trying to check us in whilst trying to manage the lobby situation. 2. We indicated to hotel months earlier than we are arriving with a baby and will be arriving late. Upon checking in, we were assigned the furthest room on a very long corridor with no help with luggages. Zero thoughtfulness for customers. 3. We also requested a baby cot. While there was a baby cot in the room, it was broken. We could feel steel frame structure and one section was even touching the floor. Baby had to sleep with two adults on a bed which is dangerous. 4. Fridge in the room was not plugged in and couldn't even be plugged into the socket (badly designed carpentry). Husband had to move the fridge at 2am to plug into another socket in order to store baby food and medications. He ended up having some cuts on his fingers. 5. Nitpicking here but it didn't help that the room wasn't on tip top condition - floor was dusty, toilet had stains. Overall stay felt like the hotel just chucked us a spare room that was probably used for storage or back up. Really disappointing and terrible hotel stay. We requested for a refund for our hotel stay but the staff couldnt do anything and offered us a lounge access/suite but why would we even want to continue our stay with such an experience?"
"16.","Halija Syuchah","33","2025-09-09","1","Don’t go for this hotel. This is the worst hotel for a well known brand hotel group I ever stayed. I arrive at 5.30 PM and checked in at 9.30 PM (4 HOURS WAITING). I already request an extra bed for a week ago, but they said they never received my request. Ok. So I ask a room for an extra bed, they said the housekeeping is from a vendor, so they need to REQUEST to the vendor. Like I said “REQUEST”. This is the most weird things. Why there is no stand by housekeeping? This is a hotel, every guest needs an assistance for any time. So we order extra rooms, already paid and it took 1 HOUR to get check in. Even though the room was good and clean, but this is the most stressful thing I ever experienced in my whole life."
"17.","Denis Foos","331","2025-10-09","5","A very beautiful and modern hotel with spacious, well-equipped rooms. Due to the building's design, the rooms don't offer much view. The staff is extremely friendly, and the breakfast is quite good. However, the restaurant's daytime menu is limited. There is also a rooftop bar on the 3rd floor, but we've never seen it open, likely due to low demand. Despite these small details, this is our favorite hotel in the region, and we always choose to stay here."
"18.","Andrea Anuzis","10","2025-11-09","5","Very friendly and welcoming staff on reception. Asked lots of questions and nothing was too much touble. Breakfast had a great selection and friendly staff again. Location near some walkable nice shops and restaurants and 10 minute Grab ride to Seminyak Beach."
"19.","Balaji Dutt","11","2025-10-09","5","I visited the hotel several months back but never got around to reviewing and wanted to fix that. The hotel was very new when we visited so some things like the buffet breakfast were not fully running, and instead an ala crate menu was offered. Apart from that we loved our stay there. The hotel is very conveniently located and the facilities were excellent. Special shoutout to the staff (and especially Fitri) who were extremely helpful and diligent."
"20.","Pan Pan Samana","81","2025-08-09","5","I love the spacious room, safe property surrounding. Walkable to nearby malls. Oh & Jacky from the restaurant is exceptional helpful & provided good service. Overall I have a great stay. Thank you ."
"21.","Dwi Putra Jaya","8","2025-05-09","5","An amazing experience staying at voco! The room was spacious, clean, and fully equipped with the bathtub being a definite highlight. There are also plenty of cozy spots to relax, especially the reading area which is spacious, comfortable, and very well-organized. The gym won’t disappoint either it's large and well equipped, perfect for a good workout. Both the breakfast and the service were excellent. Highly recommended!"
"22.","Back to Bali Now","14","2025-04-09","5","We had an amazing stay at voco Bali! The room was exceptionally clean, spacious, and thoughtfully designed—truly felt like a home away from home. The staff were incredibly friendly and always ready to help with a warm smile, making the whole experience even more enjoyable. The facilities and amenities were just perfect. We loved the pool, and the gym was well-equipped for daily workouts. The on-site restaurant offered an impressive variety of Asian and Western dishes—everything we tried was delicious! Highly recommend voco Bali for anyone looking for comfort, convenience, and top-notch hospitality in one place. We'll definitely be coming back!"
"23.","Dwi Laksono","124","2025-12-09","5","lovely stay, the staff is incredibly kind, and they upgrade our room to the king room with the pool view. nice stay! absolutely comeback! ✌️"
"24.","Daria B","144","2025-05-09","5","Amazing New Hotel! I stayed for two nights and had a wonderful experience. The service was outstanding - everyone was so sweet and welcoming. The rooms were very comfortable and bright. We got the upgrade. I had two good nights of sleep. Although the windows face the other side of the hotel, you don’t see people, so it still feels private. The gym was simple. Breakfast on the weekends was a buffet, and the food was delicious. As an IHG member, I really enjoyed my stay here. A special thanks to the security team who always helped me and my Grab drivers by stopping the traffic haha 😜 I will definitely come back!"

"26.","Leanne Whittingham","8","2025-11-09","3","Great space if you are after just a room not a resort. I felt it would be good for a business trip but not a family trip. Definitely served its purpose though."
"27.","Damian Damian","29","2025-12-26","4","Great price for a very modern and neat & tidy clean hotel, very welcoming staff. Well done voco Bali!"
"28.","Hamdan","9","2025-07-09","5","I had an amazing stay at this hotel for 11 days! The staff, including Krishna, Bila, Oscar, Arya, Novita, Abel, Fitri, and Bagus, were incredibly friendly and attentive, making me feel very welcome from the moment I arrived. The rooms were spotless, spacious, and beautifully decorated, with all the amenities I needed for a comfortable stay. The location was perfect, close to major attractions and restaurants. I especially enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere and the excellent service throughout my visit. I also want to thank the security guards, who receive daily instructions from the management to ensure safety and order—efforts that are truly appreciated by the hotel administration. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a top-quality experience!"
"29.","Tan Yong Huat","24","2025-05-09","3","Stayed at voco Seminyak Bali for two nights. Having stayed at other voco properties previously, I feel the brand is not the best fit for a resort destination like Seminyak. Fundamentally, this property feels more like a business-style hotel than a true resort hotel. The building has narrow corridors and low ceilings. This made the spaces feel enclosed and lacking the open, breezy atmosphere you would expect in Bali. The pool is extremely small, and there are no proper sundecks for guests to lounge and relax — surprising omission for a brand hotel in a Bali. The breakfast buffet was also disappointing, with only about five to six hot dishes available. Breakfast really could have been a lot better. Overall, while the staff were friendly and welcoming, the property itself did not deliver the relaxing, resort-like experience one would have hoped for in Seminyak. Would choose a different hotel on my next visit to Bali. 3.5/5."

Her positive attitude set the tone for our 2 day stay. Thanks Manik, it was wonderful to meet you and we will highly recommend the property."
"33.","Jean Christophe Moisio","1","2025-04-09","1","I booked a suite for a week and decided not to extend it and change hotels. The welcome and customer service really leave something to be desired. The breakfast is very limited compared to other hotels in Bali, with a limited selection and little variety. But the worst part is the room service: one of the worst I've ever seen, with interminable wait times and far from adequate quality. Definitely not an experience I'd recommend."
"34.","Kenddrick Chan","30","2025-03-09","5","I recently stayed at voco Bali Seminyak whilst on holiday and had a great experience. The hotel had a trendy aesthetic that gave off a boutique-hotel vibe. One of the standout features of the hotel was its mostly open-air design, with the exception of the rooms, gym, and restaurants. This adds to the charm of the hotel, enhancing the tropical experience Bali is well-known for. The hotel's location is also excellent, situated alongside a main road in the heart of Seminyak. The beach, restaurants, and bars all within a 15-minute walking distance. A special mention goes to the staff who were warm, professional, and always ready to assist. The quality of the rooms, open-air concept of the hotel, prime location, and excellent staff makes the hotel an excellent choice for travellers to Bali."
"35.","Seb Von Cripe","39","2025-01-09","4","New hotel in Seminyak. As an IHG Gold and Platinum Elite member for years. I only really stay at IHG hotels. This was a soft opening for the hotel and we stayed over the new year period. The rooms are large and spacious with nice features. Modern and new. The service is fantastic by the staff. So no faults there at all. Only reason I give this 4 star is due to the swimming Pool. As the water is not fast moving pumpers do relatively still, I was attacked a lot by mosquitoes. It’s a beautiful looking pool but the plants attract mosquitoes. I think if the plants are replaced, it would help invite the guests in to use the pool more. Dion Morgan"

"37.","Felix","37","2025-05-09","3","It’s a mid level hotel . The pool gets some sunlight but no real places to lounge in the sun . The restaurant was a little confusing - never seemed to be much hot food available. No signage about the hot food . No indication of what hot food you could order . Long wait for coffees . Low ceiling . Very nice staff however and the rooms were ok - it’s very European and sadly not much Balinese art on the walls or furniture . The gym is good ."
"38.","Galen Farris","12","2025-04-09","5","This is a great place to stay. The rooms are clean, modern and comfortable. The location is an easy walk to a lot of restaurants and bars and the beach. The staff was amazing and friendly. I want to Thank Desak personally for being so kind, attentive and professional. We simply told her that we needed to get some laundry done and she quickly arranged for our laundry to be picked up, washed and delivered to our room. We asked for recontaminations for restaurants and things to do and she was verry helpful. She, along with the entire staff made our vacation wonderful."

The room was spotless and well-maintained, equipped with complete amenities that ensured a comfortable stay. The food at the restaurant perfectly matched the menu offerings. The local dishes were rich and full of authentic flavors, while the Western options were light and delightful. Overall, I had a fantastic experience and will definitely choose to stay at this hotel again in the future."

The rooms are brand new, luxurious, large, well equipped with beautiful bathroom rain shower, bath and great body wash and toiletries.. The bedding is just beautiful!

Food is sensational from the chef and his team (and Riska).. Special mention must go to Nila, Fitra and Bagus who engaged everyday with a brilliant attitude and very accommodating nature, and DESAK from front office who made my stay extra special.
