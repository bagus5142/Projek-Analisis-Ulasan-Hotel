Bau rokok dilorongnya Breakfastnya banyak banget macamnya Kebetulan pas saya breakfast ada rombongan gathering, duduknya kacau dan gak ada pengaturan. Saya naruh hp di meja trus ambil makanan, tiba2 di depan saya ada orang lain duduk tanpa permisi. Saya maklum mungkin mereka jarang banget dapat kesempatan makan di hotel."
"2.","Hatami Bukhari","16","2025-10-07","5","The room is immaculate, the service is quick the moment I told them I have problem with my rooms. It would be even more perfect if the TV is smart TV one so guests can watch more and enjoy the room more. The view if you are lucky, you get the best views of neighborhood and vast nature, especially if you are on upper floor. The foods are amazing, lot of variations from Indonesian cuisine and western variant. The pool are just good enough, although it's not deep enough and the gyms are very basic. About 300 meters from the hotel, there's local shopping area, lot of snacks and drinks but you wouldn't find any alcoholic drinks, which what you expect from Muslim majority country. I would like to give 4.5/5 ratings but the system wouldn't allow or I don't know how, but it's fair to say it's 5/5 especially here in Pangkalan Bun"
"3.","Caecilia Sendjaja","19","2025-10-07","4","We had a lovely stay of 4 nights (6-10 Sept) in this hotel. The room was spacious with good amenities. Complimentary tea and coffee bags were available, and we could re-fill our bottle jug in the water dispenser outside the room. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Our cleaner, Rustandi, did a very good job cleaning up our room every day. One day, we came back to our room and saw a lovely suprise from him: he made lovely cute animal figures out of some towels, accompanied with a friendly note! We really appreciated this kind gesture. The staff at the restaurant downstairs were also very friendly and helpful. We were attended a couple of times by the very friendly and attentive Mr. Saiful who was always ready to help. The friendly and customer-oriented service of this hotel really made us feel welcome One small negative point: the service at the restaurant at the pool was quite poor. There was not always a staff there, and we had to wait for quite some time for our orders. This was quite annoying. The location was great, not far from the airport. Our room was on 7th floor (719), facing the park, so we hardly heard noises from the street. In summary, a very comfortable hotel to stay, especially after a jungle stay! ;-)"

Terjadi kesalahan tanggal booking (ter-booking bulan depan), lalu kami diminta memesan ulang lewat Agoda dan sudah membayar penuh. Namun reservasi tidak kunjung muncul di sistem hotel. Selama hampir 2 jam kami menunggu di resepsionis, pihak hotel tidak mengizinkan check-in sementara, meskipun sudah larut malam dan pembayaran sudah dilakukan. Bahkan diminta jaminan setara 4 kamar, yang tidak masuk akal karena kami sudah membayar melalui Agoda. Minim empati dan tidak ada solusi yang berpihak pada tamu. Jika sistem dengan Agoda bermasalah, seharusnya ada kebijakan pelayanan yang lebih manusiawi. Tidak sesuai standar hotel berbintang.Saya tidak akan merekomendasikan hotel ini pada siapa pun termasuk perjalanan dinas berikutnya"

"7.","Shofi Ayu","44","2025-12-17","5","Katanya ini satu-satunya hotel mewah di Pangkalan Bun. Kelihatan kecil, tapi dalamnya luas. Lobby nyaman, kamar luas dan bersih. Pelayannya juga ramah. Sarapannya enak, wajib coba soto manggala."

Kamar kami di lantai 1 dan sangat mudah untuk ke cafe dan kolam renang 4. Kamarnya enak serta sangat dingin 5. staff sangat cepat membantu 6. Parkir sangat banyak 7. Pesan kamar tidak include sarapan jadi tidak tau sarapannya tapi menu di cafe lantai 1 enak2 kebetulan siang ada pesan makan Selebihnya mantapppp"
"10.","ahmad suaidi99","19","2025-12-07","4","Sayangnya: kontrol buahnya kurang berkualitas (makan melon masih ada kulitnya). Juga menu sarapan pagi minim banget kayak bintang 3. Menu mau habis dibiarkan, Refill lama"
"11.","Andini Laras","80","2025-11-07","5","super love sama Mercure Pangkalan Bun ini 💕 kamar oke, ameneties toiletries lengkap, ada kaca besar buat dandan, view dari kamar oke, sarapan banyak variasinya dan enaakk 😆 fasilitas olahraga juga lengkap dan sangat oke. ada semacam jogging track walau ga bgtu besar dan playground buat anak-anak. staffnya juga super duper ramahhh. rekomended banget buat yang ada perjalanan bisnis atau liburan di pangkalan bun"
"12.","Ghifary Auza","112","2025-09-07","4","Senang sekali bisa menginap di Mercure Pangkalan Bun. Dari pertama kali masuk, kesan arsitekturnya langsung menarik perhatian—bangunannya megah namun tetap terasa hangat. Interior lobbynya elegan dan nyaman, begitu juga dengan kamarnya yang bersih dan well-designed. Amenities yang disediakan juga sudah sangat memadai. Kalau boleh memberi masukan, mungkin varian menu sarapan bisa lebih diperbanyak, terutama di main course dan pilihan protein hewani agar lebih bervariasi. Selain itu, melihat area taman yang cukup luas, sepertinya akan seru kalau ada tambahan mini event atau kids activity di luar, sehingga tamu yang membawa anak bisa punya pengalaman lebih berkesan. Secara keseluruhan, saya sangat menikmati pengalaman menginap di sini."
"13.","Rahmad Syawaludin","120","2025-11-07","3","Semua bagus kecuali resepsionis nya.. Sya chek in Hari Minggu tgl 2 Nov sktr jam 3 sore, pas smpe resepsionis mb2nya malah sibuk nelfon entah sibuk nelfon sm siapa yg pasti bkn sm tamu.....dan lama lagi.. Hrsnya klo ada tamu disambut dlu atau dikasih pengertian tunggu sebentar atau gmn.. Ini malah kek dianggap patung.... Ga profesional sekali anda dlm menerima tamu.... Bkin langsung badmood.. Tp untung kamar nyaman... Intinya pelayanan dan sopan santun karyawan msh kurang.... Hrsnya sekelas mercure bisa lebih profesional."
"14.","Alexandhe S.","449","2025-10-07","4","Menghadiri acara di ballroom lt 1, ruangannya bagus, hanya saja listriknya sering mati sendiri. Toiletnya sangat bersih, wangi. Rasa makanan cukup enak, segar."
"15.","Nijananda Nayyara","17","2025-09-07","5","Great hospitality! The staff are so nice and welcoming. Room service was ok but weirdly they couldn't charge to our rooms. The room is really nice and the overall ambience is incredibly luxurious."
"16.","Cud Na","17","2025-08-07","4","Overall kamar bersih untuk aku yg hygine freak ini, tp kesan pertama masuk tuh parkir ribet krn tidak ada yg mengarahkan, kita cari sendiri di basement, mana banyak bgt ditutup utk staff kantor gedung sebelahnya.. Akses masuk lift dr basement jg tidak ada yg mengarahkan, tdk ada keterangan per lantai di dlm lift seperti hotel2 pd umumnya.. Yg bikin ga enak awal datang kita antri check in, tamu2 lain kek bule2, dan orang lain disuguhi minum welcoming mungkin ya, lah kita dilewati aja, padahal pelayan yg bawa minum itu lewat2 bbrp x di depan kita.. Yang lain baru datang jg disuguhi, kita kek makhluk transparan? Iya itu cuma syrup orange, kita jg ga doyan, tp kesannya kok pilih2 ya? Berdasarkan apa? Kita bayar juga hey 😅 Mending kek hotel lain tuh minumnya di letak aja di water dispenser gt sedia gelas2nya, siapa mau ambil sendiri.. Untuk kamarnya bersih, krn msh lumayan baru ya, tp shampoo tdk keluar dipencet jd kita ga sampooan 😂 TV juga smart tv tp no signal katanya.. Swimming pool biasa aja tp lantai sekitarnya kotor saat itu pagi2 kami berenang, ada sampah dan tumpahan makanan bahkan di dekat kolam belum dibersihkan.. Mungkin lain kali tingkatkan lg pelayanan tanpa pilih2 yaa krn baru check in udah ilfeel duluan jadinya 😌"

"19.","Calvin Yong","14","2025-05-07","5","Stayed at Mercure Pangkalan Bun and was pleasantly surprised by the 5-star quality experience. From the moment we arrived, the hospitality was outstanding — special thanks to Feby, one of the waitresses, for her warm and attentive service during breakfast. The rooms were clean and well-maintained, offering a comfortable stay. The gym and pool are modest but functional, and the lobby is beautifully designed, giving a premium feel to the whole property. Breakfast was excellent, with a great variety of options and quality food. Truly impressed by the overall service — this hotel definitely feels like a hidden gem that punches above its star rating. Highly recommended if you’re visiting Pangkalan Bun."
"20.","Nur Ardiansyah","5","2025-04-07","5","I had a great stay at Hotel Mercure Pangkalan Bun. The room was spacious, clean, and comfortable, making it a perfect place to rest. The parking area is also large, so finding a spot was never an issue. The food was delicious, with a variety of options to choose from. Breakfast was particularly satisfying, offering high-quality and tasty dishes. The swimming pool was clean and well-maintained, providing a great place to relax. Overall, my experience at this hotel was excellent. The staff was friendly and professional, ensuring a pleasant stay. I would definitely stay here again on my next visit to Pangkalan Bun. Highly recommended!"
"21.","T Tan","36","2025-10-07","3","Ask for a room away from the main mosques (i.e. not facing the road on the west or south side). We had 305, which unfortunately was exposed to a very loud morning adzan and sermon that went on for a full hour. Food and service are decent, although email replies are slow."
"22.","Raynaldi Adilasta","9","2025-08-07","5","I've been here so many times for my business trip and I can't lie that this place is the best hotel in central kalimantan. A perfect place to cool down my stress after the long trip, good swimming pool (not that big but at least they are open for a long time and have a nice view) The room, the lobby, the service and the food are excellent!"
"23.","Gerard Hendriks","9","2025-06-07","5","Really a very nice hotel for a few nights. The rooms are clean and everything works. Also good blackout curtains, which is certainly nice when you want to take an afternoon nap. The location of the hotel is a bit less. No real larger shops to be found where you can buy good clothes or something. They also do not have Grab or Gojek taxi scooters here so you can quickly go somewhere. Great swimming pool and fitness room available. In the dining room you will find a delicious breakfast buffet. My coffee was served by Tessa, a very friendly lady who is immediately ready for you when you have questions! Nothing is too much trouble in the restaurant! This is the second time I have come here."

"25.","Jolene Chin","12","2025-05-07","5","Booked and checked-in for 1 night and really liked the place. Decided to book another night later on in the week but accidentally booked the wrong date on Agoda. Hotel was not able to accommodate the request to change the date by a day later despite the error in booking made less than 5 minutes ago! And offered to give us a “special” rate if we book the correct date direct with them. The “special” rate was higher than what was available on Agoda. Really wanted to give a great review but it was just a bad experience! Disappointing. EDIT: The hotel contacted us and made the date change as we had requested. They also allowed us an early check-in when we returned. We greatly appreciate them going the extra mile. The bed, pillows and bedding was ultra comfortable and such a luxury after returning from a boat trip to Tanjung Puting National Park. Would stay again!"
"26.","Fitha Anggraini","38","2025-08-07","5","I have been awaited to stay here when they said Mercure hotel will be established in Pangkalan Bun. Always happy to stay here, breakfast was good, gym was clean, but I haven't tried the pool yet. Sometimes they served local fruit like matoa. Last time I was there, I thought I lost my necklace and the person in charge was very helpful. Thank you Mas Wisdy."

Unexpectedly pleasant, becomes guest of the day with all its perks, cakes in the room, doll towel and all. The hotel deserves a longer stay, which am thinking for next time.

This was our first experience staying in Pangkalan Bun, as we have just moved to Kalimantan, specifically to Kabupaten Lamandau, which is about 2 hours from Pangkalan Bun. Taking the time for a staycation at Mercure turned out to be the best choice for us. Especially for our daughter, Zevana. She was so happy and even swam for 4 hours yesterday! See you again soon, we will definitely come back. Please send our regards to the entire Mercure team. Love, Zevana Family"

"43.","Colin Rassfeld","6","2025-01-07","5","Our family stay at the Mercure Pangkalan Bun was simply outstanding! From the moment we arrived, we felt incredibly welcome. The hotel staff went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable, and they were especially thoughtful with our two children, making sure they felt at home. The rooms are spacious, modern, and had everything we needed for a relaxing stay. The beds were super cozy, and the kids loved having their own space. Every morning, we enjoyed a delicious breakfast with a great variety of dishes to suit everyone’s taste – including some local treats that added a special touch to our experience. It was wonderful to unwind at the pool, which the kids adored. For families looking for a balance of comfort, friendly service, and unique experiences in the heart of Indonesia, Mercure Pangkalan Bun is absolutely perfect."

"47.","Papa Bit","12","2025-09-07","3","I don’t understand why you allow people getting in the pool with their clothes on?! This is zero respect for the rest of us, that pay you for a service that we will never use. In the post covid era, this is unacceptable. You should not allow this."

"52.","AIG","1188","2025-04-07","4","Hotelnya besar dan bagus, kamarnya juga besar dan bersih. Menu breakfastnya kurang variatif, dan menu westernnya limited (nggak ada sosis). Kamarnya dingin (malah kadang terlalu dingin) tapi temperatur AC-nya nggak bisa distel, jadi matiin-nyalain manual. Di kamar nggak disediakan air mineral botolan gratis, tapi ada jug tempat air yang bisa diisi di dispanser yang disediakan di setiap lantai. Housekeeping ngebersihinnya nggak standar dari hari ke hari, ada yang isi tempat sampah nggak dibuangin, ada yang gelas nggak dicuciin, ada yang keset kamar mandinya malah jadi basah, dll."
"53.","Diandra Talita Spama","15","2025-02-07","5","Pros: Hotel dengan interior yang mewah, hospitality-nya sangat baik. Massage spanya enak bangett. Dinner di Kelakai Restaurant order carbonara dan nasi goreng cumi, dessertnya order cheesecake worth it enakk semua🤩👌🏻 Cons: Tv dalam kamar masih menggunakan chanel tv biasa tidak dilengkapi dengan netflix/disney/hbo jadi lumayan bosan kalau mau stay dikamar"

I arrived late after all day traveling to be met with the irritating hotel form to complete all my details… details that the hotel already had through my company booking… why do they do this? The room was excellent and the food and drinks fine. However, the pricing for beer is well above even Jakarta prices…how can Mercure justify this?"

"57.","Elysabeth Stevany","56","2025-03-07","5","Hotel paling berkelas di pangkalan bun. Akses mudah, 15 menit menggunakan taxi dari bandara. Layanan ramah, bersih. Merupakan hotel baru yg selesai dibangun di 2023. Banyak turis luar yg menginap disini untuk keperluan traveling. Kamar baru, bersih, wangi. Sayang AC kurang dingin. Resto oke, makanan bervariasi dan area resto cukup luas. Lobby hotel jg lega dan estetik. Bagi yg ingin menginap untuk keperluan bisnis dgn citra borneo disarankan ke mercure saja krn sebelahan dgn kantor citra borneo. Tips: jika untuk keperluan bisnis coba sebutkan nama PIC citra borneonya siapa tau ada diskon (ini kata org citra borneonya). Ada juga diskon corporate bagi yg kerja sama dgn mercure."

"63.","Muhammad Iqbal Aji Pratama","415","2025-01-07","5","Hai Mercure Hotel Pangkalan Bun Sebelumnya izinkan saya untuk mereview Mercure Hotel Pangkalan Bun. Sorry terlambat mereview hehe. Pertama untuk Mercure Hotel Pangkalan Bun ini lokasinya sangat strategis ya di tengah pusat kota Pangkalan Bun/ Kotawaringin Barat. Saya suka juga karena dekat dengan pasar tradisional dan supermarket hehe. Kedua dari segi bangunan dan lobbynya jangan ditanya ya sangat mewah dan khas untuk hotel-hotelnya Mercure hehe keren 👍. Ketiga dari segi Kamar nya ya pastinya keren lah rekomendasi banget kamarnya dan no comment hehe, namanya juga Mercure Hotel kan. Keempat dari segi fasilitas nya fantastis ya lengkap banget pokoknya, dari gymnya sudah bagus juga, swimming pool nya juga keren btw designnya. Kelima dari breakfast pasti istimewa lengkap ya. Yah intinya saya pasti bakalan kembali nginap di Mercure Hotel Pangkalan Bun jika berkunjung ke Pangkalan Bun/ Kotawaringin Barat hehe. Oiya saran mungkin untuk check in sudah tidak perlu pakai deposit ya, sama untuk check out ga perlu nunggu lama dong untuk ngechecknya. Standarnya bintang 4 harusnya check out bisa langsung ditinggal ga perlu tamu untuk menunggu ya, apalagi menunggu sampai 15 menit itu lama banget, ini saran aja. Btw sukses selalu untuk Mercure Hotel Pangkalan Bun. Saya pasti akan kembali menginap di sini. Terimakasih. Best Regards, Iqbal"

"67.","Vicki and Niall","9","2025-03-07","4","We stayed here before and after a 5 day klotok trip to the forest, to see orangutans. The facilities were absolutely fine, and the service was *great* - the hotel staff were super welcoming and helpful and went out of the way to meet our needs. Two very minor criticisms - first, the food on the breakfast buffet was cold, even at 6am. And the hotel has no soundproofing, despite being the most modern building in Pangkalan Bun. Ordinarily, I think that would make no difference, but we went during Ramadan and that made for a very interrupted night’s sleep. Not anybody’s fault, but you may want to think about this before you book if you’re not a moslem."
"68.","Irene Ghoman","5","2025-03-07","5","Hotel luas, kamar luas, bersih, rapi, wangi, service sangat ramah dr front di loby sampai di house keping sangat baik dan ramah terutama Mas Eko yang handle kamar saya, Sarapan juga enak semua.. Sangat memuaskan menginap di Hotel Mercure Pangkalan Bun. Door lock sangat baik jadi merasa sangat aman."
"69.","Dea H.","83","2025-03-07","5","My stay was very pleasant. The hotel is new, and all the amenities were great—hairdryer, hot water, Wi-Fi, and AC all worked perfectly. The bed was very comfortable, and all the towels were new and in great condition. Breakfast was also delicious. The only downside is that the location is a bit far from the city center, but online ojek and taxis are available. The hotel does offer its own taxi service, but it's more expensive, so I’d recommend using an online taxi for airport transfers. The staff was very friendly, and the atmosphere upon arrival felt very welcoming. Overall, I was very satisfied with my stay."
"70.","Александр Ягупов","37","2025-01-07","5","I really liked the Mercury Hotel. I stayed a year ago. For some reason I didn't find my review, so I'm writing again :) The hotel is brand new, recently opened. Everything is fresh and modern. The staff is friendly and helpful. Large comfortable rooms. Gym, (where all the simulators are in good working order, and this is rare in Indonesia :))) There is a small but cool pool. Excellent breakfasts. The food is delicious in the restaurant. In Pangkalanbun, this is, of course, the best hotel. Separately, I would like to say more and thank you to the hotel manager - Dona, who, in my opinion, is at work 24 hours! I spent two weeks at the hotel. The service is beyond praise."

"78.","Cheryl Huxley","145","2025-01-07","5","Lovely hotel - very clean, spacious rooms with a comfortable bed and pillow. We loved the 2pm check in which is earlier than most hotels - we were desperate for a good shower after being in the national park for 3 days! Great selection of food for breakfast, both western and Indonesian. We also ate at the restaurant for dinner and they accommodated our slight meal changes. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. It's a great idea to have a name badge telling you they speak English so you know who you can converse easily with. Big thanks to Tedi who went out of his way to help us when our flight was delayed, which meant we were going to miss our connecting flight. He rang both airlines to find out information and booked us a hotel with airport transfer in Jakarta. He was incredibly helpful - thank you Tedi."

Mohon bisa ditingkatkan lagi atau kalau bisa hilangkan saja deposit-deposit merepotkan itu!"

"103.","Sorcha Fitzgerald","94","2025-01-07","3","This hotel is brand new and rooms are great but there is some issues that for the price I don't think should be there. Early check in price is extortionate for rooms that are already ready. Check in takes a long time. Our bathroom shower kept going from scalding to freezing to no pressure at all. The middle tiles in the bathroom are uneven so water sits there stagnant after you shower, no way to get rid of it. We were going to be checking out at check out time (12.00) and we had 3 separate phone calls starting at 8.00am if we were checking out or extending. Made us feel like we were being hurried to leave? Very unprofessional. Our guide told us about many other local family run hotels in the area that are a lot better value for money, my advice would be to go for one of them."

The process somehow is really long, though the staff is not slow, it’s just long to take them to finish all steps. And they asked for deposit so when check out it takes so longer. In average, 12-15min/person to just check out!!! They should simplify the process and increase the persons check in counter. I was super late for my flights."

"123.","Clothilde Petitjean","218","2025-01-07","2","Do not book here if you expect a great service, this hotel is only for the show. We decided to offer ourselves a treat by staying at this hotel after a 17h bus drive from Pontianak, and were very disappointed. There were fresh pee stains on the toilet seat, no warm water and no shampoo left. Which we could have disregarded if not for what happened at check out 😱. They took a picture of a little blood spill on the sheets (because of menstruation) and showed it to us (and to everyone at the checking desk at that moment) asking us to pay an extra 100 000 rpie for it. We challenged it, even if we could have paid, for the principle, we didn't even complain about the state of the toilet seat (I cleaned it myself) when we arrived and then this happens to me: showing the picture to everybody on top, I was baffled in a bad way about the absence of standing and professionalism from start to finish."

"128.","James Gillanders","13","2024-01-07","2","Rooms and facilities were nice but I'm sure that's only because it is brand new. If you're reading this in a couple of years I'm sure it's gone downhill drastically as it is badly run. The guy at the front desk was very condescending and rude along with several other of the employees I encountered. They seem more intent on keeping creases out their uniform than actually helping guests. I passed through the lobby where an elderly couple was struggling with all their luggage (no luggage carts in sight) and I ended up helping them to their room while employees just stood around. Very few people were staying at the time I was there yet they still had no interest in keeping the bar area clean (no alcohol just 100,000 for a pineapple juice to which they automatically add gratuity). By far the rudest staff I have encountered during my month in Indonesia. Breakfast was good."

Minusnya: mungkin masih harus banyak belajar dari hotel dengan kelas yang sama. Menu sarapannya sedikit untuk ukuran hotel bintang 4, kalau makanan habis refill nya lambat sekali. Menu makan siang dan malam itu2 saja, kurang bervariasi dan tetap refillnya lambat. Housekeepingnya masih butuh banyak perbaikan, sebaiknya mengikuti SOP agar tidak ada yang salah atau terlewat. Pelayanan kurang ramah. Terdapat perbedaan perlakuan antar tamu. Mungkin menginap di sini kemarin jadi yang pertama dan terakhir."

Staf baik membantu dan ramah traning nya mantap kalo ini 👍 5. kamar bebas bau-bau an juga bersih, tp perlu perhatian di air panas kamar mandi agak kurang nendang suhu nya. 6. daftar menu di kamar tdk ada, mau pesan makan jadi bingung. 7. desain hotel bagus dan modern serta ada unsur kedaerahan nya.

"150.","Cecilia","76","2025-01-07","3","I wanted to give more stars, but to be honest the service is quite disappointing in terms of communication. We go to the bar, ask plenty of times when it closes . They say 9pm. Then after half a hour they say 8pm, then they say 10pm. We sit. Order a cocktail, they tell me they have no alcohol. We order beers, when they arrive they give me the cocktail list. Why do you say completely different things continuously? What is worse: we book a taxi to the airport for the day after , we see the guy (Julian) writing down the taxi reservation note for 6:30am. All good. We wake up at 6am and call again reception to make sure the taxi is booked , they say “yes yes of course “. We go downstairs and no taxi. The guy completely unaware of the situation. Then he calls Julian, the colleague who was supposed to book the taxi and he says “Julian called the taxi but they did not reply so we did not book”. Are you serious ? This is completely unacceptable and we risked losing our flight back to Europe because you are not professional. If we need a taxi and you confirm you booked it you cannot surprise us last minute saying you did not call. After we asked you twice and you said yes ! Really unacceptable behavior for your employees."

We could enter it at 12.00 after our trip. It’s a good hotel to start the Tanjung Puting trip. Some downsides; The food in the restaurant is limited because they have to import it from Jakarta. Some menu items could not be served they still are developing the hotel since it is new. The manager came to talk with us and handled with care."

I also was only able to communicate in English which sometimes seemed to create confusion. I leave 4 stars rather than 5 as I think there are a few subtle things that they can do better, but if you are looking for quality accommodation in the area then you can’t go past the mercury."

Newly opened not everything is finished yet, but it really doesn’t matter. This is the best you are going to find in this town. We booked it months before they announced their soft new opening. The food is great, much better than Plataran Bromo we came from. It is a modern business hotel with spa, gym and outdoor pool. You will find your modern comfort the last time before heading into the jungle here, so enjoy! We even booked a room upon return from the jungle to refresh in a proper shower and take a great breakfast before our flight out. Don’t miss their massage. You are not going to find 90 min massage for 30€ anywhere in the west."

Cleanliness was impeccable so kudos to the housekeeping team :) Swimming pool could be bigger and the breakfast selection could be better. There wasnt anybody at the spa, receptionist should be there at all times. Cinta was the star of my visit though. She's so friendly, speaks Cantonese which i do too a bit. And so helpful to all the guests. This girl needs more recognition. I'll definitely going to be back just for her service."

Everything is so overprices. The food in the hotel, breakfast, taxi!! (if you take taxi few minutes you pay 150k, it´s crazy). For breakfast arund 190k, lunc/dinner starts at 120k and the burger is 350k. Food is not bad, it´s good but definetely worth the price. If you want to lent scooter it cost 100k/6 hours, so 200k for one day, it´s crazy. Not really satisfied with such overprices services"

I do see the staff working hard, but if you make a reservation for a massage treatment at 20:00 and you go to the restaurant 1,5 hours earlier, it surprises me that we only had our food at 20.15, in an empty hotel...I don't want to know wat the situation looks like when the hotel is fully booked! There are actually 0 vegetarian options on the menu. And if you ask for a certain dish without shrimps, they tell you that the shrimps are krupuk. Eventually the dish is packed with shrimps, while I'm allergic to seafood. I could have died in this place if it wasn't that I was very careful. It al comes down to this point: the staff, apart from the reception, hardly speaks English. This is very surprising since Mercure is a worldwide hotel chain. Next time I will go to a local hotel."

Ideal untuk beristirahat sebelum atau sesudah naik klotok (perahu sungai). Sangat direkomendasikan!"
"493.","swantje meerjungfrau","11","2025-12-10","3","Kami hanya ke sana untuk makan dan minum – tidak banyak pilihan tempat minum di Pangkalan Bun (alkohol dilarang). Semuanya tampak sangat modern dan berstandar Barat, tetapi tempat yang mereka sebut bar dan restoran sama sekali tidak nyaman dan kurang suasana. Istilah bar juga menyiratkan bahwa mereka menjual alkohol dan koktail. Birnya sangat mahal, dan pelayan (sangat ramah dan perhatian) kesulitan membuka botol seolah-olah dia belum pernah membukanya sebelumnya. Fakta bahwa bir umumnya diminum dingin tampaknya tidak mereka ketahui."
"494.","Cesar Ruiz cuartero","16","2025-08-07","5","Teman saya Ana dan saya, Cesarrrr, menginap di hotel ini selama beberapa hari. Tak diragukan lagi, ini adalah hotel terbaik di seluruh Indonesia. Pengalamannya luar biasa. Dari saat Anda tiba hingga Anda pergi, pelayanannya luar biasa. Semua staf sangat perhatian, sopan, dan membantu. Hotel ini bagaikan oasis kecil di pusat kota. Modern dan baru. Fasilitasnya sangat lengkap. Sarapannya sangat bervariasi dan memiliki semua yang Anda inginkan. Saya merekomendasikannya 100%. Jangan ragu. Ini hotel 10/10. Terima kasih semuanya."
"495.","Corail Bigorneau","2","2025-10-07","5","Hotelnya sempurna! Kamar-kamarnya luas, tenang, terang, dan bersih. Restoran dan kolam renangnya sangat menyenangkan. Dan sambutannya luar biasa! Terima kasih kepada Tessa atas sambutannya di bar dan kepada seluruh tim atas senyum dan perhatian mereka; kami merasa diperlakukan seperti pangeran/putri!"
"496.","Fernando Quintín Ruiz","9","2025-09-07","4","Hotel dengan harga terjangkau di lokasi yang minim pilihan. Hotel ini masih baru, dengan fasilitas, kamar, dan kamar mandi yang baik. Tempat tidur dan bantalnya sangat nyaman. Biaya transfernya lebih mahal (€11) daripada taksi, tetapi setelah seharian bepergian, mereka akan menunggu Anda dengan nama Anda tertera di sana. Makanannya lebih mahal daripada di pinggir jalan, tetapi enak dan berlimpah. Yang paling mahal adalah birnya, yang harganya baru bisa Anda ketahui setelah membayar (sekitar €9 untuk 600 ml)."
"497.","Juanjo R","476","2025-08-07","1","Hanya karena ini satu-satunya hotel bagus di Pankgalan Bun yang kedatangan tamunya. Resepsionisnya memperlakukan Anda dengan sangat ramah. Kalau mau kamar sebelum waktu check-in, Anda harus mendaftar di Club Mercure. Mereka meminta Anda untuk menunggu, tetapi bahkan tidak membantu Anda. Tidur jadi mimpi buruk karena masjid ada tepat di sebelahnya. Untuk makan malam, kami menghabiskan waktu satu jam antara memesan dan menerima pesanan. Hotel yang buruk dan tidak peduli dengan kesejahteraan tamunya. Mereka memblokir 100 euro dari kartu Anda, memperlakukan Anda seperti penipu, memberi tahu Anda bahwa jika Anda mengambil sesuatu dari kulkas, Anda harus membayarnya, dan memaksa Anda menunggu untuk memeriksa kamar guna mengembalikan deposit. Mereka membuat Anda merasa seperti penjahat. Apa yang dianggap biasa di hotel lain, mereka pertanyakan apa yang Anda lakukan di sini. Saya telah mengunjungi lebih dari 500 hotel dalam hidup saya, dan saya tidak pernah diperlakukan seperti ini. Sangat tidak menyenangkan."
"498.","Ge Su","21","2025-08-07","4","Kamarnya sangat bagus, tempat tidurnya nyaman. Makanan di restorannya lezat dengan pelayanan yang baik. Kolam renangnya agak kecil dan berangin—Anda pasti tidak ingin berlama-lama di sana. Ruang kebugarannya kurang terawat. Resepsionisnya buruk—check-in dan reservasi taksi sangat rumit—perlu beberapa kali telepon dan perkenalan. Tamu lain mengalami masalah serupa saat memesan layanan spa. Setelah awalnya diberi tahu bahwa air di minibar gratis (seperti semua hotel di Asia), kami kemudian dikenakan biaya saat check-out. Sangat tidak ramah. Resepsionisnya lebih mengutamakan kecantikan (wanita dengan riasan dan gaya yang sempurna) daripada pelayanan. Sayang sekali!"
"499.","Primož Černic","557","2025-08-07","5","Luar biasa, jelas hotel terbaik di kota ini. Bersih, rapi, kamar bagus, staf ramah, mungkin agak jauh dari restoran... sangat direkomendasikan."
"500.","Ilaria Zanfranceschi","341","2025-01-07","5","Hotel yang sangat besar, cukup sepi di musim sepi (November), terletak di lokasi yang strategis untuk bersantai sebelum dan sesudah bertamasya ke taman nasional. Kamar-kamarnya bersih, nyaman, dan praktis. Staf resepsionisnya sangat profesional, ramah, dan siap membantu. Layanan antar-jemputnya nyaman, begitu pula pilihan untuk membawa sarapan jika Anda berangkat lebih awal. Direkomendasikan."
"501.","Ivan Dominguez","4","2025-10-07","5","Hotel yang luar biasa! Fasilitasnya sempurna dan layanannya tak tertandingi. Terima kasih khusus kepada Tessa atas layanannya yang luar biasa! Terima kasih!"
"502.","Nadine Gherdaoui","21","2025-10-07","5","Sambutan yang luar biasa, kamar yang sangat nyaman, dan harga yang sangat terjangkau. Terima kasih sekali lagi!"
"503.","Sara Higueras","32","2025-01-07","5","Kami menginap sehari sebelum dan sesudah naik perahu. Sayang sekali hotelnya tidak terlalu ramai, padahal hotelnya luar biasa. Stafnya sangat ramah sejak awal, ketika salah satu manajer meminjamkan kami 5.000 rupee, kami harus membayar taksi karena kami belum sempat menukar uang (jika Anda membaca ini, terima kasih banyak). Mereka memberi kami kamar sebelum waktu check-in, dan secara umum, semua orang, termasuk yang saya yakini sebagai manajer, selalu sangat sopan dan baik kepada kami. Makanan dan sarapannya lezat, dan kamar-kamarnya baru dan sangat nyaman. Saya rasa banyak orang yang langsung tiba di Pangkalanbun untuk naik perahu lalu pulang lagi, tetapi saya sangat merekomendasikan untuk menginap setidaknya satu malam di sini untuk beristirahat."
"504.","Stefania Baiguerra","162","2025-09-07","5","Hotelnya bagus, stafnya ramah. Harganya lumayan mahal."
"505.","Disfrutando Del Viaje","156","2025-01-07","5","Hotel yang sangat baru, ideal untuk awal atau akhir rute klotok melintasi Taman Nasional. Fasilitasnya sangat modern dan fungsional. Sarapannya bervariasi dan pelayanannya sangat baik. Kami merasa pelayanan saat makan siang dan makan malam sangat lambat. Yang kurang kami sukai adalah hotelnya setengah kosong, dan karena kami tiba pukul 10.00 pagi, mereka menagih kami $20 untuk check-in lebih awal meskipun kamar kami sudah siap."
"506.","Nati Llas","317","2025-01-07","5","Pengalaman menginap yang spektakuler. Hotel baru yang terawat baik, sempurna untuk persinggahan di perjalanan Anda. Stafnya luar biasa, terima kasih Julián dan Mía atas keramahan mereka. Sarapannya termasuk kopi terbaik yang pernah saya nikmati di Indonesia. Sangat direkomendasikan."
"507.","Alexandra","236","2025-01-07","5","Hotel yang relatif baru dengan standar Barat dan nilai yang sangat baik. Kamar-kamarnya berperabotan apik, tempat tidurnya nyaman, dan semuanya bersih. Saya sangat merekomendasikan Mercure."
"508.","Luis Lopez","8","2025-01-07","1","Rasio harga-kinerjanya tidak sepadan. Harga makanan, layanan antar-jemput bandara, dan semua layanan tambahannya selangit. Kalaupun mereka mau menaikkan harga, biarlah perbedaannya terlihat jelas. Ditambah lagi, mereka memberi kami kamar dengan pemandangan terburuk, tepat di sebelah unit AC luar ruangan, dengan para pekerja bekerja dengan gergaji di depan jendela kami, sementara perancah menghalangi pandangan kami yang terbatas. Sungguh tidak sepadan."
"509.","Oci Krimm","24","2025-01-07","5","Hotel yang sangat bagus, stafnya ramah dan membantu, dan restorannya juga bagus. Lokasi hotelnya strategis, sekitar 15-20 menit dari bandara. Kamar-kamarnya juga sangat bagus; kami dengan senang hati akan menginap di sini lagi."
"510.","HANSUB LIM (World traveller)","500","2025-01-07","5","Saya menginap di sini semalam untuk tur orangutan. Saya dengar ini hotel terbaik di daerah ini, dan tempatnya bagus. Lokasinya juga strategis. Sarapannya sangat direkomendasikan!!!! Saya membayar tarif tetap 100.000 rupee untuk naik taksi dari bandara (seperti kartel?). Harap diperhatikan. Ngomong-ngomong, pusat kebugarannya agak kumuh. Sepedanya rusak dan terbengkalai, dan selain dumbel dan treadmill, tidak banyak yang bisa dilakukan."
"511.","Anna Marin","6","2025-01-07","4","Hotelnya terawat dengan sangat baik dan indah, tetapi Anda merasa harus membayar harga yang sangat mahal untuk semuanya. Naik taksi seharga 36.000 dolar AS dikenakan biaya 200.000 dolar AS, dan mereka terus-menerus menekan Anda untuk memberikan ulasan yang baik."
"512.","Babette Weiß","4","2024-01-07","2","Hotel yang sangat bagus dengan staf yang ramah dan selalu membantu. Sayangnya, mereka sama sekali tidak terlatih secara profesional, dan proses di hotel sangat tidak profesional dan tidak terkoordinasi. Misalnya, jika Anda duduk di bar kolam renang, kopi yang Anda pesan sebelumnya harus dipesan dari bar lobi. Namun, kue tersedia dalam keadaan dingin di hotel. Jika Anda ingin menikmati keduanya sekaligus, kuenya sayangnya akan terpengaruh suhu, dan kopinya hanya hangat-hangat kuku. Sayangnya, layanan pijat yang diiklankan tidak tersedia. Meskipun jam buka yang diiklankan, Anda tidak dapat membuat janji temu. Di malam hari, staf ada di sana dan dapat diajak bicara (tetapi hanya dalam bahasa lokal, Inggris, menggunakan penerjemah daring), tetapi tidak ada janji temu. Jika Anda membuat janji temu untuk keesokan paginya, janji temu tersebut akan dibatalkan begitu Anda tiba. Sungguh tidak profesional..."
"513.","Amador de leyva Molina","27","2024-01-07","4","Hotel ini sangat baru tetapi masih banyak hal yang perlu diperbaiki. Saya merasa sarapannya sangat mahal, yaitu 180.000 rupee (12€) untuk apa yang disajikan. Kamar dan kamar mandi, termasuk tempat tidur, sangat bagus. Resepsionisnya perlu ditingkatkan."
"514.","Reto Meier","2","2025-01-07","5","Sonia dan Bayu sangat ramah dan membantu. Kami sangat puas dan akan menginap di sini lagi kapan pun. Terima kasih atas pengalaman menginap yang menyenangkan."
