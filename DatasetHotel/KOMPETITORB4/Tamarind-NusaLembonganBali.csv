"1.","Goldstein Daniel","113","2026-01-02","5","I would definitely give a 5 star rating for this place. Beautiful place and located very close to the beach Even though there is no direct beach access there is hardly anything to complain.. the beach is just a small walk from the resort. Even though the resort has a lot of stairs to climb they do offer buggie service so not much of a complaint. We stayed in villa 9 and it has amazing views to the beach. Food is top quality and economical as well. We tried in other local shacks but the quality of food in this resort was way too good compared to the food in the local shacks. Staff was very helpful a d friendly."
"2.","Sara Dahlstedt","7","2025-12-09","4","We had a longer stay at the Tamarind when we visited Nusa Lembongan. First off, the location is fantastic - walking distance to the main street and to wonderful beaches for swimming and water sports. It is worth noting that you need to climb a number of stairs to reach the rooms (at least 3 or 4)! The hotel room we stayed in was wonderfully kept - the AC had no issues and cleaning service was great. Complementary water in sealed bottles. The balcony doors don’t close to 100 percent, but the curtains in front insure that you can keep bugs and such out. Comfortable bed, great Wi-Fi and a TV compatible with streaming services. Nightly turndown service where you receive some water and cookies was lovely. The other areas of the hotel could, however, use some restoration. There are two deeper pools, and one shallow one for kids. The pool areas do feel like they have been forgotten about for the last couple of years, and do no reflect the standard I think the Tamarind wishes. When visiting the gym, while there was all basic equipment available, I also noticed that one of their ACs down there didn’t work. The breakfast is ordered on an a la carte menu, and some customizations are allowed. Sufficient lunch and dinner menu. Overall, the service we received from all of the staff was absolutely wonderful and truly something we’ll remember!"
"3.","Family Reviews","97","2025-12-26","5","The BEST resort we stayed at in our entire Bali trip! Service was OUTSTANDING, food was DELICIOUS, and the rooms were IMMACULATE. From the moment we reached, they made the entire experience so welcoming and personalized. We arrived early, so the room was not ready, but they helped us lock up our belongings and took us for an excursion while we were waiting for the room. By the time we got back, they had set up the room with a special welcome message! Also had nightly turn-down service included. 1. Organized all of our excursions and paid for it themselves, we just paid a lump-sum amount at the end. With all excursions (Nusa Penida, snorkeling) - they arranged private transfers. Also had private pick-up and drop-off from the ferries. Agus was a great driver. 2. Food was so fresh, best Nasi Goreng we had the whole trip. Thanks Puthu! 3. Arya was so nice and accommodating! We needed some medicine from the store, Arya went and picked it up, and brought it to us at the resort. Always had a smile on his face. He is the heart and soul of the hotel."
"4.","Roya Surachman","16","2025-12-09","5","Me and my friend had one of the best experience while visiting Nusa Lembongan. Stay at The Tamarind made our journey feel completed. The hotel located only walk away to the beach. We stay at a spacious deluxe room with an absolute nice ocean and mountain view. The staff was very nice. During breakfast Harri has given best service and information about our very delivious breakfast meals. Not to mention the coffee is blend very well with the vibe."
"5.","Ary Nojowintono","11","2025-11-09","5","We stayed in 6 hotels and out of those 6, the beds at Tamarinds hotel sleeps the best! 10 out of 10, not to forget the staff at the restaurant, Harry and Putu! Servers to its finest. The stairs could be a workout, but all worth it! I would Defenitly stay here again. Very recommended! The rooms are so spacious but I just can’t get over the mattress’s. I can’t believe that there is a bed that sleeps better than mine! 5+⭐️"
"6.","Liam Mahoney","2","2025-08-09","5","Fantastic service from start to finish at The Tamarind. Many hotels cater to your needs, but The Tamarind stood out to us as one that gets the little things right, and makes you feel at home. Best hotel in this regard of the ones we stayed in on Bali. Location is pretty well situated near the main strip on Nusa Lembongan. Not quite “in the middle of it all”, but we didn’t feel limited, and besides there are many inexpensive, accessible transportation options to get wherever you’d like (not to mention most of the island is quite walkable). The breakfast is also great, with a solid menu rather than buffet style and a nice, peaceful view. The room was nice and comfortable. No issues with this hotel and would recommend to anyone."
"7.","Anja Potalivo Rieker","3","2025-11-09","4","Very nice hotel, super friendly staff and excellent cuisine. During our stay there was a large group of people (friends) staying at the hotel, we were not warned beforehand I.e. during reservation recess, that this could be a noise and service problem for the other guests. It revealed to be very loud; we had to insist having a decent table for dinner (which btw was excellent), but could not have a normal conversation during dinner, same story at the pool …"
"8.","Simon Brown","5","2025-10-09","5","We had a very relaxing time at the Tamarind resort. Our room was comfortable, the facilities (gym, pools etc) were impeccable and every morning the breakfast was excellent. Though what made the hotel special was the service. It was personal but not intrusive - the staff (Putu,, Ane and others) knew our names and showed real care and attention. We definitely plan to come back."
"9.","Julia Sleeper","199","2025-10-09","5","Incredible place to stay! Absolutely stunning, excellent customer service, the food at the restaurant is delicious and the area is much more walkable than I first thought. Just 5 minutes to many food and restaurants and coconut beach! The spa pricing is also very affordable which was nice to have!"
"10.","Oliver Calligaro","12","2025-07-09","5","Could not fault the place in any way. The staff were so lovely and made our life so easy. On the last day my partner was sick and they made their best effort to help us. With highly attentive room service, great food We were treated very well. And this is on top of the fact that the hotel was amazing with fantastic views and great rooms. 10/10 come to this place!"
"11.","Alexandra Dela Cruz","10","2025-08-09","5","This was our very first time visiting Nusa Lembongan. We had an incredible 3 night stay at The Tamarind Resort! We enjoyed every bit of our stay from start to finish. We already cannot wait to come back! Convenient location - only a few minutes walk from Jumgubatu Beach & all the main restaurants & cafes. To get around the island, the resort helped us rent a scooter which was a super easy & affordable process. Great quality & tasty food at their Indica Restaurant. We loved the buffet breakfast & made the most of their efficient room service! We were lucky to experience a complimentary dinner bbq night with special Balinese dancing too. The infinity pool was BREATHTAKING! Nice day beds & a pool bar. Such a perfect place to relax & unwind. Although the most memorable part of our stay was the incredible staff & service. Every staff member we encountered went above & beyond to get to know us & make us feel at home. Special mention to Harry, Putu, & Ade for always looking after us. One thing to note is there are lots of stairs in the resort but this did not bother us. You can always request a room on the lower levels if you do not want too many stairs. Overall we had a wonderful experience here & would recommend this place to anyone visiting Nusa Lembongan. We will definitely be back. Thank you Tamarind Resort for an unforgettable stay!"
"12.","Daniel Pearl","2","2025-09-09","5","Tamarind resort is well positioned on the main road running behind Lembongan harbour and Jungutbatu beach. It is a short walk to nearby restaurants and local amenities. The hotel is beautifully designed and the rooms clean and well proportioned. The facilities are excellent with 2 swimming pools (one of which is an infinity pool). There is also a pool suitable for young children. The food is fantastic and the staff exceedingly friendly. They go out of their way to help you organise any trips, or to hire local vehicles for touring the island and really go the extra mile. The staff learned all our names on our first day there, and always welcomed us by name whenever they saw us and asked if they could help us with anything. It was my wife’s birthday during our stay and they left a gift and card in the room, which was a lovely touch. This is a small resort, and the quality of the service and the unique personalised touches really made The Tamarind stand out for us as a family. We would definitely recommend Tamarind to anyone visiting Nusa Lembongan."
"13.","sarah hughes","3","2025-12-09","5","Perfect location, great room, and fantastic staff. Harry and Putu were so lovely and did an amazing job making our trip special. Highly recommend!"
"14.","Rochelle Airdrie","3","2025-08-09","5","Everyone knows about the Tamarind Resort on Nusa Lembongan however, the best kept secret on the Island is the Spa - Amlika Spa at the Tamarind. I tried several treatments during my stay and the facials were a favourite. Using quality products and attentive therapists it was one of the best facials I have ever had. Absolute pure bliss."
"15.","Fraser Johnson","7","2025-06-09","5","We had a four night stay at the Tamarind and it has definitely become our must stay hotel in Nusa Lembongan. We originally had a different hotel booked however needed to find a new hotel and booked the Tamarind on the transfer over and were BLOWN away. The rooms were large, the food and drinks great and, most importantly, the staff were incredible, friendly and helped make our stay unforgettable. Harry, Putu, Dewi and Tya often assisted us, gave us pointers on our trip and made us feel at home and comfortable. They will also help you organise connections, activities on the island and rent scooters. You just need to ask and you’ll get assistance! A must see is their perfect sunset pool with the most incredible views overlooking the island and the mountains of Bali. Enjoy it with a Green Island cocktail! It was my partners 6th trip to the island and the Tamarind is now his preferred hotel (and for good reason) and we will definitely be staying again."
"16.","Alexia Merrington","75","2025-06-09","5","We had the most delightful time at The Tamarind and enjoyed our stay immensely! The breakfast was delicious and exceptional! The staff attentive & polite. We hired e bikes from the hotel and explored the island which was wonderful. We also had a lovely and relaxing massage at the spa. Highly recommend this cosy, comfortable and friendly hotel! Wonderful experience!"
"17.","Ryan 1","19","2025-06-09","4","Nice hotel, lots of steps which is tough in the heat but good service and food is good. I would not say this was 5 star personally but just my thoughts having stayed in other 5 star resorts. Side tables should be put in rooms and an iron as standard but rooms are very spacious and air con is great. Love the Bluetooth speaker too. Harry was a top guy and very friendly. Quiet hotel, good if solo traveller and want peace. However it did seem a bit too quiet at times for us."
"18.","Alice Chan","10","2025-05-09","1","Not a 5 star hotel and we have stayed in many. The place is run by younger staff, took an hour and a half for our luggage to be brought to our room. It is a mission just to get a glass of water. 90% of the time we were in the main pool area (where there is a pool bar) - we have to go looking for water as there is no staff around. Although plenty standing around in other areas. In one instance, we were told to go down to the restaurant and find our own. The service is laughable for a 5 star and considering it is a small hotel you would think the service would meet the bare minimum standard given there a more staff than guests! The room smells damp and run down, particularly the bathroom. The floor in the room was absolutely filthy when we checked in (soles on our feet were BLACK). The facilities are run down, the sun beds are filthy and the hotel public bathrooms are gross and run down as well. During our first night, at 5 am we were startled awake by with a leaf blower outside our room, blowing petrol smoke literally everywhere (without warning).. it’s for the mozzies, but seriously? A jump scare wakeup and petrol smelling smoke filling the room. A warning at least would have been nice. Again with the service - it’s seriously subpar for paying premium on the island for a hotel which is supposedly 5 star. A room next door had plates of room service food left out from the afternoon around 3 pm . In the morning at 9 am, plates were still there. The extent of the turn down service were 2 bottles of water and making the bed. No other tidying or refresh. Oh and don’t hire a bike through the hotel or organise any activities through them - they are charging twice the price of local prices. Same for the restaurant, overpriced although the food isn’t awful.. however we had heard the place sees common food poisoning!!!!!!!! Overall the place is a COMPLETE let down compared to other 5 star hotels, wanted to leave as soon as we arrived. What they say about the stairs is true, there are ALOT. We want to give praise to Dewi, however, who was helpful and lovely."
"19.","Mark Heggart","3","2025-06-09","5","Vishnu and the team were wonderful and looked after us extremely well during our 5 Day stay . The staff always smiling and happy to help and ask how is your day. Great breakfast , very comfortable beds and quality linen. close to the beach and a nice gentle walk into town to a variety of other food choices. Will definitely stay again"
"20.","Ashley Massa","8","2025-05-09","5","We can’t recommend The Tamarind enough - it’s probably the best place we’ve ever stayed. The service and staff are real-life angels and the kindest people you’ll ever meet - a special mention to Harry, Putu, Ade and Dewi for making our stay so special. The location is perfect and the amenities are fabulous at the resort. We had many meals, cocktails, and massages in-house. We can’t wait to come back! ♥️"
"21.","Lori Krolik","3","2025-05-09","5","The Tamarind is a gem on Nusa Lembongan. The facilities are first rate from the amazing views while you lounge in the pool to the excellent food to the wonderful spa experience. The staff are all friendly and want to make your stay there the best it can be. Our room was spacious and relaxing. We loved just hanging out on the rooftop while watching the surfers below."
"22.","Arizal Akbar","29","2025-12-09","5","Splendid place with amazing view, near with harbour and many nice places to hangout. Thanks team for your great service and hospitality while staying. Highly recomended👍🏻"
"23.","Miya Langstrom","5","2025-07-09","5","We had the most amazing food after a long day of travel here! Harry at the bar was so welcoming and provided the most amazing and welcoming service for us! He even provided tips for things to do for us girls who just arrived in the area as we asked him and made us feel so cared for! 5 star treatment from harry we appreciate him so much!"
"24.","Catherine Shovlin","185","2025-05-09","5","We stayed here for 4 nights and were very happy with our spacious room and balcony with great view. Service is consistently good from all staff. Plentiful free drinking water which I love. We didn’t eat here but the included a la carte breakfasts were excellent. Way better than the usual tepid hotel buffet 😊 Everything is clean and well kept. Stylish contemporary design"
"25.","Chris Peate","7","2025-01-09","5","The Tamarind offers an excellent experience to all types of travellers, situated within a very short walk of the shoreline, offering easy access to lovely bars and restaurants. The food at the hotel is also lovely with traditional Indonesian and more western focused food on offer. The breakfasts to are lovely, ordered a all carte from a wide range of options. The hotel itself offers some lovely rooms with exceptional views of at Sunrise and Sunset. The pools are also just what you need to cool off and relax. We enjoyed using the upper pool with its infinity views over Lembongan Harbour area and beach. Our stay was made extra special but the wonderful staff, with the trainees team being just a s friendly and helpful as the other staff. We must give a special mention to Harry who looked after us so well in the pool bar and also at dinner, he really went the extra mile to help us out. Overall a fantastic hotel in a very convenient location but it is the staff that make it such a wonderful experience."
"26.","Alyssa Butler","23","2025-01-09","5","Really enjoyed our stay at the Tamarind. Very modern / luxurious rooms built into the cliffside. Great location to stay at for us who don't ride scooters. Walkable on the beach to Jungu Batu beach and other food spots. Rooms were comfortable with great A/C. The pool on the highest level had a beautiful view. The stay were all incredibly kind and helpful - booking activities and transportation, as well as checking up on us after we got sick during our stay. Could not recommend more!!"
"27.","Amy Nijenhuis-Aylward","8","2025-01-09","5","We stayed here for three nights after staying three nights in another area of the island, but we wish we’d have stayed at tamarind resort the entire time. We absolutely loved our stay here! What a beautiful hotel with very lovely and welcoming staff. The location is great! You’re right near everything but also far away enough that there isn’t any noise pollution. We rented a scooter for the duration of our stay and could be anywhere in ten minutes or less! There are three pools but we only used one. It’s very well kept and refreshing after a beach day! It was also great to have the little gym to use after ten days of barely moving! The staff are so genuine and always remembered our names. And the breakfast was delicious! Harry and Ade, especially, were always making sure we were enjoying my our time! Our only (small) complaint would be that bits and pieces in the room could use some updating. Our toilet seat was quite old & stained, for example, but otherwise everything was clean and the bed was very comfortable Would come back for sure during our next stay in a Nusa Lembongan!"
"28.","Sarah Chapman","7","2025-01-09","5","The Tamarind Resort is absolutely amazing - a must stay when you come to Nusa Lembongan. The location is stunning with incredible views out over the beach and Bali mainland. The facilities were beautiful, very clean and well looked after. We were upgraded free of charge. The staff are so kind and helpful. Particularly Harry (the super hero of Nusa Lembongan). He was so helpful, kind and chatty and really made our experience very special. He also makes the most delicious cocktails to enjoy at the swim up bar! We will 100% return again."
"29.","Budi Okta Kusuma","38","2025-12-09","5","Good concept with huge tamarind tree located in hotel loby, at the resto we can feel the fresh wind blowing hair with the sea view"
"30.","katie ashforth","12","2025-01-09","5","We moved to The Tamarind because we had an issue with our other hotel and they were so accomodating. We stayed in one of the villas and it was beautiful. Has everything you need, stunning view of the island, good air con, three pools. The breakfast and restaurant food was yummy but best of all was the staff. Everyone was so friendly and always so helpful. The hotel is in a great location as well, we had a scooter but you could walk lots of places from here or use the hotel driver for a small fee. Highly recommend the Tamarind we will be back :)"
"31.","James Catley","22","2025-01-09","5","We stayed 4 nights in the Tamarind and would highly reccomend it. It is the best resort on the island and the best location. It is a 2 minute walk to the main beach and all the best restaurants. The room, service and breakfast were all amazing. The pool bar was was a great place to relax with views over the island. The staff were all so friendly, but a very special thank you to Harry and Adi. Your hospitatility made our honeymoon truly memorable. Hope to see you again in the future."
"32.","b.","339","2025-01-09","5","The is a great resort. We enjoyed a 4 night stay in the vila at the top of the hill. We had a fabulous view from my room and were positioned right next to the swimming pool. The hotel was quiet and comfortable. The service was extremely friendly and helpful. While in the hotel, we enjoyed the beautiful spa. We each had a massage and found the therapist very skilled and well trained, we walked out of the spa, totally relaxed and ready for a nice meal and a quiet evening. I can recommend this resort with confidence that you’ll enjoy us. Stay here. Give it a try. It’s close to everything on this island. Everything you want to do is just a few minutes away by foot or local taxi. Enjoy."
"33.","Jake Neilson","28","2025-01-09","5","The Tamarind Resort were absolutely amazing for the first stay on our honeymoon. All of the staff were incredible and so friendly. The rooms were amazing and always clean. Also the breakfasts were incredible. Would highly recommend for anyone wanting some luxury when visiting Nusa Lembongan"
"34.","Logan","2","2025-02-09","5","The islands of Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Ceningan are amazing to visit all year round. If you’re looking for a place to stay the hospitality of The Tamarind is exceptional. Special mention to Putu, Jay and Harry who went above and beyond to make our stay magical. If you’re looking to explore, The Tamarind can help with anything or if you’re looking to relax by the pools and eat good food it’s got be at the Tamarind! Hot tip* order a lovely cocktail to have at the top pool the view is unmatched! (There are 3 pools!!)"
"35.","P Le M","21","2025-05-09","1","There is a severe issue with damp and mould in room 206. The bedsheets were moist and mould painted over - it is uninhabitable. Sadly they didn't have any other rooms available for us to move in to, so we had to check out. Hilariously, they said they would only process a refund if I agreed to sign a form that promised I wouldn't share my experience online. Also, beware the ‘garden view’ rooms - outside the window is just a brick wall covered by a few plant pots with banana leaves, and no natural light gets into the rooms - hence the damp issue."
"36.","Mi Gray","59","2025-01-09","5","The resort is on the side of a hill. Which gives fabulous views for the two pools and the restuarant. We stayed in a sea view room which was lovely. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. The food at the restaurant was very good and it was lucky there were so many steps to burn off the calaroes! If you ask them they will show you a quick way to walk to the beach that avoids the roads and only takes 1-2 minutes. The ocean is turquoise and there are many restaurants including some on the hill with spectacular views. A day trip across the yellow bridge to Nusa Cenigan is a must. Snorkeling is excellent too especially the manta rays."
"37.","Sarah Abbott","48","2025-01-09","4","This is a lovely resort in a top location. It’s small so you get to know the staff - special mentions to Harry, Dewi and Putu - thank you for looking after us so well :) the rooms are clean and the air conditioning is excellent (effective and quiet). The bathrooms (especially the toilets) are a bit tired & there’s a bit of a funny smell in them. The food is excellent & reasonably priced (& is delivered to your room for no extra charge)! The location is great - convenient to walk in to town. Reception can organise a taxi for anywhere further afield."
"38.","Fawn Silver","8","2025-05-09","5","A must stay, the rooms are nice and the views are spectacular. The staff is very friendly and kind. They are truly concerned they you having a good time and happyl Great food and a comfy place to stay."
"39.","Karen Walsh","7","2024-01-09","5","Booked 3 nights here with my partner and ended up staying an extra night as we both loved it so much. All staff are super friendly and kind, especially Putu who always went out of his way to help us, greeting us by our names every time. Breakfast was lovely. We ate lunch and dinner here every day as they were 10/10. Rooms were lovely and spacious and clean, turn down service every night also. Aircon excellent. Restaurant pool and rooftop pool were excellent, we nearly always had them to ourselves too. Would highly recommend staying here when coming to Nusa Lembongan."
"40.","Victoria Dale","5","2025-01-09","5","We had the perfect stay at The Tamarind! Stunning pool areas, great food and ideal location. Staff were so friendly and attentive - special mention to Ade, Dewi and Harry in the restaurant who were particularly brilliant when my fiancé went down with Bali belly on our first night at the resort! And also to Anton on reception who was so helpful, both before and during our stay with organising ferries, taxi’s, scooters etc. Would recommend especially for couples, and we hope to return in the future!"
"41.","Lorraine Morgan","260","2025-01-09","5","Lovely place only 5 minute walk to the beach. 2 infinity pools. Friendly service. Spacious and clean rooms. Gym and spa. Be aware it is located on a hill - reception is at the bottom and it can be quite a lot of steps up to some of the rooms"
"42.","Anthony Wise","123","2025-01-09","5","Stayed in the villas for 6 nights with 4 kids and 3 other families. Villas are extremely comfortable and roomy with amazing views from the rooms and rooftop daybed area. Fresh fruit delivered every day and the staff were so thoughtful and even brought us up fresh coconuts to drink when they found out that a few of us had fallen sick Great central location only a few minutes walk to the cliffside restaurants and beach, and 15-20 minutes into the centre of the main street restaurants Staff were the best! Nice little gym Washer/dryer in the room Meals were excellent Very helpful in organising all our transfers and day-trips Perfect Lembongan stay for us Tip: Villa 107 is the best for views and has an extra rooftop spa Note: The climb from reception to the Villas is long and steep but the kind staff will run you up in a golf buggy if you need"
"43.","S J","9","2025-01-09","4","Perfect location for surfing. Very friendly staff and great service. Excellent breakfast. Avoid the Candrika rooms, some of which have no view at all except for a green wall in front of the terrace. We had to change rooms for this reason. Unfortunately, the absence of a view is not specified at the time of booking (describing the room as having a garden view is misleading). Apart from this problem, we would happily return."
"44.","Baotran Nguyen","10","2025-01-09","5","We are very happy here at Tamarind Resort. Their service is the best we have experienced anywhere in the world. From the great communication before our arrival to when we are here, we have been impressed by all in the Tamarind family. They are friendly, engaging and professional. They make an effort to get to know you without invading your privacy. Wishnu gave us a very warm welcome upon arrival and Jay showed us to our beautiful Villa. The team at the restaurant (Harry, Putu, Ade and Tya) were very nice and they obliged to all our dietary requirements happily. The housekeeping team kept our Villa tidy and clean and brought us all the things that we needed promptly and always checked in before they leave if they can of service. Even the maintenance guys were super friendly when we needed help with our washing machine! The team helped us with last minute activities even when their usual partners were booked, they found a way to make things happen for us. The view from our Villa is amazing and the Villa is very spacious. The stairs are not that bad.. and if you don’t want to walk them, the staff are happy to take you up on the Buggy. The restaurant strip is very close by, only 3-5mins walk. And we went to coconut beach to swim, that only took less than 10mins walk along the boardwalk. Such a long review because I sincerely want to thank the team for their hospitality and kindness. When we go on holidays, it is because we need a break from the stresses in our daily life, and to come to a place as welcoming as this, with people who are happy to be around, we are truly grateful."
"45.","Dest Sta","1","2025-10-09","5","The service was perfect from Harry, he was very helpful and friendly, we loved him so much ❤️, hopefully we can stay here again and meet him again ❤️ really really appreciate it. XX"
"46.","Lucy Shaw","39","2024-01-09","5","We had the absolute best experience during our stay at the Tamarind Resort! We stayed for two nights, and the service we got from the staff was beyond excellent. Specifically, Harry made our stay so enjoyable, made us delicious cocktails and dinner, as well as took our order ahead of time for breakfast the next morning, and we thoroughly enjoyed our conversations with him. He truly went above and beyond to ensure we had the best experience. Komang was also extremely helpful and friendly, he helped us book our day tour to Nusa Penida and a scooter rental, and even helped carry our backpacks to the port once we were leaving the island. The location of the resort is fantastic, only 3 min from the harbour/beach. The resort itself is clean, well kept, and has two beautiful pools. We would highly recommend the Tamarind Resort to anyone looking to stay on Nusa Lembongan! Thank you so much for the lovely stay."
"47.","claudia","21","2025-01-09","5","Beautiful hotel with the best view of Lembongan. The staff were amazing - especially Putu who learned all our names upon arrival and went above and beyond for us! We stayed in a Villa which was spacious and comfortable- an outside shower in the downstairs bathroom and baths both upstairs and downstairs! Location is perfect. Taxis pass regularly & hotel also can accommodate for you. Dining/Breakfast is yummy😄 Alongside the a la carte menu, there is a table of pastries, cereal & bread."
"48.","Kristen Malloy","65","2024-01-09","5","A gem!! We loved our 3 night stay at Tamarind! The resort itself is very beautiful and well maintained. The infinity pool is amazing and the staff are so friendly and welcoming. The restaurant/room service was also very good and we thought the prices were reasonable for a resort. The location is close to town and there are several restaurants within walking distance. The Tamarind went above and beyond to make our honeymoon special and we couldn't ask for a better stay! This is definitely the place to stay I'm Nusa Lembongan :)"
"49.","Jessica Mooney","41","2025-01-09","5","Words cannot begin to describe how wonderful this resort is. My husband and I were celebrating our honeymoon and unfortunately got “bali belly” from a previous place. We ended up spending two whole days in our room. The staff was so helpful and attentive. They brought us bread, rice, bananas and water on multiple occasions and didn’t charge us. They also called a doctor to come to the villa so that we could receive treatment. The 3rd day we finally felt better and were bummed that we wouldn’t be able to see nusa penida. We only had 4hours before the ferry but the staff called a company to come and ensured us we would make it back in time. We were shocked at how much we were able to see in such a short time. We never would have found this particular company to take us if it wasn’t for the staff. We are forever grateful to this amazing group of people. They truly helped us through such a difficult time. I cannot say enough good things about how kind and friendly these people were. Not to mention, the resort is absolutely beautiful and clean.

He helped us with napkins to get dry and tried to call us a taxi. He was so kind, but we didn’t get to say thank you- so thank you very much!"
"51.","Marina Taylor","11","2024-01-09","5","Our family of four stayed here for 3 nights and we absolutely loved it. We had a 3-level villa with stunning views and beautiful infinity pools to swim in. The staff are amazing and will do anything to help. Special thanks to Harry, Putu and Ade. The food at the restaurant is top quality and delicious. We loved our breakfasts - so tasty. Can't fault this place. The only regret is we didn't stay longer. The island is very relaxed and easy to get around with beautiful beaches and lots of cute cafes. Next time we will stay at the Tamarind Resort for longer. Thank you!!!"
"52.","Jean-Claude Etter","413","2025-01-09","3","The Tamarind is nice and probably the best choice on Lembongan, but value for money is questionable and overall experience is definitely not that of a five star property. Rooms are 3-4* class, you have to try your luck to get a warm shower. Water beds are growing algae. There is at times a slight sewage smell at different locations on the property, though not in the room. Breakfast simple, barely ok for the price range. Staff is nice and friendly, but everyone is in Bali. Bigger question though is whether to come to Lembongan at all, vs alternatives on Penida without the hassle to cross via public boat. If i return, i would try Maua on Penida."
"53.","A Boden","25","2024-01-09","5","We had a brilliant stay at this resort. A wonderful place to relax for a few days. The staff were very helpful and attentive. Harry went out of his way to offer excellent service. When we wanted to change room, they accommodated this request which made our stay all the more enjoyable. The infinity pool at the top of the hotel is blissful! Very nice touch with the daily turndown service too. Breakfast options fantastic - never had a bad breakfast! Very keen on their á la carte breakfast concept as opposed to a generic hotel buffet. Would definitely return to this place. The owner could consider investing in some resort maintenance for broken pool tiles, mouldy/green walls etc. A simple jet wash and the place would be sparkling."
"54.","Noa Scholtemeijer","2","2025-01-09","2","Our stay at the Tamarind Hotel was disappointing, to say the least. We arrived expecting to be taken to our room at the scheduled pickup time, but instead, we waited approximately 3 hours. The décor upon entry was not terrible, but the air conditioning in the waiting room was non-functional. We eventually went upstairs to a rooftop deck where we ordered lunch. The menu was confusing, lacking a proper lunch section and only offering dinner options, though we were told it was a lunch menu. Despite this, we ordered the steak and avocado sandwich, a cake, and spring rolls. The food tasted good and the portions were generous, so at first, it seemed promising. However, once our room was ready, we found it underwhelming. A foul odor, reminiscent of sewage, was coming from the bathroom, and there was a strong chemical smell. Every surface except the tables was dusty, and the bottom of the taps was dirty. For the price—roughly a few hundred euros or dollars per night—it was extremely disappointing. After we complained, someone came to clean the bathroom, but the smell barely improved. We were then moved from the Atapa Deluxe Room to a Villa for three people, though one bedroom was locked because we had paid for two. The villa was bigger, but every non-table surface was covered in thick layers of dust. The bath wasn't properly connected to the floor, leading to a near accident for my brother. Crumbs were found behind the cushions, though that was less concerning. Despite the spacious rooms, the décor was sparse and uninviting. The villa did come with a dishwasher and a laundry machine, which was a plus. For the price—around 900€/$ per night—this was far from acceptable. The hotel certainly doesn't offer value for money, and given that this was our first hotel on the island, we hoped others would be better. Unfortunately, after this experience, we severely doubt it. Initially, I would have given 3.5 stars, but given the inability to give half-stars and the fact that we ended up with food poisoning from the food we ate here, I'm rating this experience 2 stars. Thank you for reading my review of the Tamarind Hotel. I apologize for any grammatical errors."
"55.","Jace Moreno","91","2023-01-09","5","What an awesome spot. The service staff were some of the kindest and most helpful people we've ever had. The hotel is beautiful, loved the multiple pools. So many great little touches - from the nightly turndown service with towels crafted into animal shapes to the breakfast pastry bar. Location was also great, walking distance to much of town and right next to the beach. Thank you all so much for a great stay 🙏"
"56.","Toby","13","2024-01-09","5","We came back to stay 3 nights here after staying here 10 months ago. Fabulous resort with undoubtedly the best rooftop pool and bar, with incredible views, in all of Lembongan. Staff super friendly and kind (Harry). Breakfast delicious too with lots of variety. Well located too. Short walk from main beach where ferries land, also quick walk to Deck and Lago restaurants/hotels."
"57.","Tyrone","3","2024-01-09","5","Amazing resort with even better service. The staff here at The Tamarind went above and beyond for us during our short but beautiful stay here on the island and we can’t thank them enough. The resort also has an amazing restaurant serving great food all day long, definitely recommend the Saturday night BBQ! Also can’t forget the incredible rooftop pool with amazing views."
"58.","Ratri Maria","2","2023-01-09","5","Our family had the pleasure of staying at the Tamarind Resort. Besides the amazing view, the staff is beyond helpful and friendly! There was nothing we didn't like about the room, towels, and sheets, since everything was clean and smelling pleasant. The nightly turndown service with towels shaped like sea animals was one of our favorite little touches. Location was also great, walking distance to the beach and many popular restaurants and spots.Thank you to all the staff that made our stay one of a kind. It was just perfect and we truly enjoyed getting to know you all. See you again soon :)"
"59.","Mitchell Erickson","4","2024-01-09","5","Enjoyed our 5 night stay here as part of our Honeymoon. Staff is very friendly and hard working, remembered our names from the moment we showed up. Helpful for booking activities or scooter rental. Breakfast was great, ate dinner at other locations. The manager, Wishnu was very friendly, upgraded our room on Day 2, and was very helpful. Recommend to anyone!"
"60.","Kelsey Schutte","8","2024-01-09","5","We absolutely adored this spot. The staff are so kind and made us feel like family. Special shout out to Putu, Wira, Ade and Harry. It is a short walk (5-10 minutes) to many bars and restaurants, both local and international options. The room amenities were great and the view was amazing. We especially loved breakfast. We would 100% recommend to others and stay here again!"
"61.","M","78","2025-01-09","5","We enjoyed a 3 night stay here, staff are very kind and help in every way they can. Massive shoutout to Harry who made our good stay great! The bathrooms could use a refurb specifically the shower/bath. There is also a large amount of stairs, although if the buggy is available the staff will transport you."
"62.","humera hasan","130","2025-01-09","4","Lembongan's most luxurious offering apparently. At first glance as we entered this resort there was definitely a sense that it needs maintenance. I don't know why the flooring are stained with leaves and insects. When a simple daily cleaning can make it look so much better. This property gave you a sense that at some point must've been amazing but now the maintenance is lagging. Pros Service staff is good and tries to address all your needs. A lot of the bookings for Transport and getting to the ferry was handled by the desk at a premium, but they were very efficient about it. They also managed a transfer for my daughter alone out to Bali airport, which was very helpful. The food at the restaurant was decent Having a washing machine was a huge help midway into our holiday Resort is very close to the ferry of D'star which makes pickup and drop off very easy Cons Anybody who has climbing difficulties or finds it difficult to go to great heights will find getting to the villas a trek. A seriously vertical architectural design If you look at the pictures, it is in dire need of maintenance. If you look at the pool wall area, the edging of the Bathrooms, the finishing of the windows and doors - all need maintenance desperately. The breakfast was not great at all. All the baked items had a very odd and strong flavor. I feel they do not use butter for croissants, but rather some kind of Palm oil. We asked them to arrange Transport for the day in nusa penida which was a mistake. The driver was old grumpy and not really the most helpful. The rate was also expensive. It is much better to just hire a driver locally when you get off at the ferry."

"65.","Monty Hamilton","75","2025-01-09","5","Extraordinary, in every way! We stayed in one of the private villa with 3 bedrooms with my parents-in-law and our two kids - the place is enormous and luxury in every detail, set over three levels with a full suite downstairs, two bedrooms on the middle level and a rooftop with the most remarkable 270° view, day beds and dining table. The food was delicious and the pools - wow! Just a few steps from our villa was a dedicated kids pool, and also a larger pool just above with a bar - I literally had a beer, in the pool, watching the football! Cant wait to return!"
"66.","Tom Goodwin","133","2024-01-09","3","I don't like leaving bad reviews and this one hurts more than most. The staff are amazing, the building was fantastic but this hotel is not one I'd return to again. Lets start with the pro's - Truly amazing staff. - Good location - A really nice building/complex and great design The negatives. - I think a fortune was spent on this place about 8 years ago, High level finishes, a bold ambitious design, but there has been ZERO maintenance. The entire complex needs looking after . The pools seem to have dirty water, the steps leading everywhere are thick with green growth, leaching of mortar, dirt. It felt rather sad. It's not a problem in and of itself but this is really not a 5 star place. ONE day with a pressure washer and this would all be sorted. It does not feel luxury at all and for this price point it should be taken care of. Bath robes were torn and felt sad. Small towels given, TV was large and was once top of the range but now doesn't work with streaming and seemed like it needed to be replaced. It's an island, I get it, but you're saying you're 5 Star. Food was quite nice, but given Bali is FULL of incredible, well presented, cared for food, this is seriously below expectations. Again, not a problem but considering the price point it's rather annoying. Charging 11% as service when most charge 5% is a bit strange, as is charging more than most amazing coffee places charge, for below average coffee. This is a place with very high ambitions but given the competition is really misses the mark. Again, amazing staff and a perfectly good stay, but I'd never choose this place above others. Bali just has too many far far better places to pick this one. But if you've booked already, look forward to a decent time in a lovely building on an amazing island with great views and lovely staff everywhere. You won't be sad. You will have just missed out a bit"
"67.","Kevin","14","2024-01-09","5","In a recent trip to Bali, my wife and I decided to take a spontaneous adventure to Nusa Lembogan. While on the island and realizing there was much more to see, we decided to find a hotel and stay the night..... but we werent prepared. In an exhaustive search we came upon the Tamarind Resort. This place has a great location, stunning views from the rooms and the pool terraces. We texted using what's app and they were responsive and accommodating. When we got to the hotel, we realized just how unprepared we were, relying too heavily on western banking convenience, we hit some speed bumps getting our cards to work. The hotel manager, Wishnu, couldn't have been more patient, understanding, kind, and supportive. We were obviously embarrassed by our difficulties but didn't feel anything but kindness and caring from Wishnu and his team while we sorted everything out. Once worked out, we had a great dinner, a nice treat of cake bites in the room, a good nights sleep and warm shower, and a delicious breakfast in the morning. In the less than 18 hours we were there, we felt like family, like we were there for a week stay. The hospitality was leaps above the hotel we were staying at in Nusa Dua (The Kepinski). Thank you Wishnu and his team. Highly Highly recommend!!"

"69.","Lauren T","32","2024-01-09","5","Best stay we had our entire 2 week trip to Bali.

"70.","Alissa Borda","3","2020-01-09","5","Everything at this hotel was just perfect. The rooms, the grounds, and of course the pools were just stunning and extremely well maintained and clean. However, it was not the property that makes this resort special, it’s the individuals that run it. They were the most genuine and friendly people we have encountered on our travels anywhere! If we needed anything, they were nothing but happy to help. They booked several things for us (snorkeling, scooter, spa) and they were excellent. If we didn’t need anything they always remembered our names, who we were, and previous conversations we had. We truly enjoyed getting to know everyone. We have since moved on from this little resort and our next hotel now feels far too large. We wish we could go back! Thank you to all the staff that made our stay one of a kind. It was just perfect and we truly enjoyed getting to know you all :)"
"71.","Zak Broderick","26","2021-01-09","5","Overall: Great spot to stay if you find yourself on the island. The Resort: Amazing infinity pool with an equally amazing view that was the perfect spot to unwind. The Staff: The staff was great and attentive, making sure that we were comfortable during our stay. The Room: First, the view from the room was breathtaking. Second, the room itself was thoughtfully designed and very clean! The Food: Food and drinks were great, with a wonderful breakfast every day. Angga makes a delicious cappuccino. The Location: Great location that made getting around the island a breeze. Walking distance to many popular restaurants and spots."

"73.","Nathan D'Esposito","1","2024-01-09","5","The Tamarind Resort overall exceeded expectations!! After spending two weeks in Bali, both on the mainland and Nusa Lembongan and staying in multiple locations, by far, the Tamarind was honestly the highlight of our trip. from check in to check out the staff were absolutely impeccable. A few names to mention, Wishnu. He was so welcoming on check in and made our first visit to the island very comfortable with shuttles from the beach to the resort on arrival. Also accommodating to all our needs in regards to transport around the island throughout our stay! Thank you Wishnu! Harry in the restaurant was very kind every morning at breakfast. It was lovely to get to know him more and more each morning throughout our stay. Thanks Harry! Wayan at reception helped us organise our day to day activities as well as giving us some local knowledge on sistering island of Nusa Penida and available tours. Thank you Wayan! Overall The Tamarind Resort was amazing and hard to fault. Location and facilities were second to none. We will be back again! Thank you Tamarind Resort!!!!"
"74.","Marisol Askey","205","2019-01-09","5","So beautiful here! Top notch facilities with luxurious rooms that have beautiful views. Three stunning pools with one reserved specifically for kiddos, one next to the restaurant and the most beautiful one atop the roof with a swim up bar that you can watch the sun set from. There are not a ton of rooms here so EVERYTHING feels very private and exclusive with Indonesian art greeting you at every turn. The restaurant is beyond tasty and is very reasonably priced for the food. What really makes this place for me though is how sweet and truly happy the staff is. It is obvious that they are treated very well here and that translates to kindness toward the guests."
"75.","Josh Ward","2","2024-01-09","5","My partner and I stayed here for a week and we were so impressed with the facilities, location, the hospitality and most importantly the friendliness of the staff.

"76.","Joris Knoppert","3","2019-01-09","5","I have stayed at this resort with my girlfriend after it was opened just a year ago. Very lovely place, beautiful rooms with all amenities that you need and spacious bathrooms with great showers. Turndown service with the house made treats were very nice and the pool at the top deck overlooking the harbour and ocean was probably one of the best pools I ever stayed at. Service is great, just as you expect from a 5 star resort. Staff is friendly, helpful and thinking ahead to comfort you. Food was great too with a great fusion of local and western tastes. You can see in everything this resort wants to be number one in Lembongan and if you ask me, they are on the right track to becoming so!!"
"77.","Jack MacCalder","50","2025-01-09","5","Very nice Hotel. Will be back. Courteous, friendly staff that go the extra mile and don't just smile and nod. Good food at the (in house) resto, although we only ever ate the breakfast. In all, The Tamarind is quality."

From the amazing welcome, the super friendly staff, the amazing food (amazing— I mean it!), to the lovely clean faculties— everything about The Tamarind was remarkable. It is very walkable to get around downtown FYI ;) We were so sad to leave and wish we could have stayed longer. What an amazing place!"
"80.","Philipp Schumann","6","2019-01-09","5","My girlfriend and I were fortunate enough to spend a couple of days at this lovely new hotel on Nusa Lembogan. The hotel has a lot to offer, including a fantastic gym, great food, spectacular views and most important of all: great staff. All staff members we interacted with went out of their way to ensure we were comfortable and taken care of. The manager also personally inquired with us to make sure everything was alright. In fact we enjoyed our stay so much that we even spontaneously decided to extend. We hope to return again soon. It was certainly the highlight of our trip to Indonesia. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great place on Lembogan in a heartbeat."
"81.","michael bertolacini","20","2025-01-09","5","Exceptional staff and accomodations. Ended up leaving a day early and normally a hotel would say we can't refund you the extra day and I wasn't expecting them to do so but they zeroed out our onsite tab which is why I'm writing the review. That really shows a level of commitment to hospitality that is beyond rare and I thought was just a real testimony to the establishments genuin kindness."
"82.","Rosie Laura","42","2020-01-09","5","Me and my boyfriend stayed at this hotel for 5 nights and it was AMAZING! The grounds are unbelievable, the facilities ( gym ect ) are the very best on the island. What made our stay extra special is all of the staff! They are honestly the most special staff I’ve ever had the pleasure to encounter (and I’ve stayed in numerous 5 star hotels all around the world). They go above and beyond many times a day for EVERYONE. I can’t express enough how special this resort is, I will be recommending to everyone going to Bali and the islands around to stay here! Hopefully I will be back too! - Robert & Rosie"
"83.","Dirk Wolter","93","2021-01-09","4","We enjoyed our 3 day stay. The Tamarind arranged our ferry from Sanur as well as the pick-up / transfer, all this worked perfectly. Overall the service was great, with the staff always friendly and helpful. Rooms are clean and spacious but have only limited ocean view. The balcony is great but unusable due to the hot weather (why don’t they install a ceiling fan??). The hotel offers a fantastic a la carte breakfast – with various healthy options. BF was included in our room rate though we had to pay for the 2nd coffee. Not a big deal but given the rather expensive room rates, feels odd. Location is OK but not great, we would prefer staying at the mushroom beach next time (beach access, bars and restaurants). However, it’s easy to get around with a rented scooter (available for 80,000 IDR per day). Tamarind’s 15min free spa voucher is a nice idea but, in the end, useless as we couldn’t get appointments booked (only one therapist). TV programs are limited and of poor quality – in a 5-star rated hotel I would expect at least some of the international news channels like Bloomberg, BBC. Wi-Fi is fast enough. Though the Tamarind Resort is certainly one of the best hotels in Lembongan, I don’t think the advertised “5-star resort” label is justifiable. Expect a 4* with good service, nice breakfast, clean & spacious rooms."
"84.","Darina Voloshina","30","2019-01-09","5","Best place to stay on Lembongan by FAR! It's pricier but it is totally worth it. The rooms are beautiful and clean, the staff is amazing, the spa is perfect and the food is delicious.

We were scared to ride motorbikes so they gave us complimentary use of their golf cart. Highly recommend!"

"88.","Sarah Plack","124","2020-01-09","5","We absolutely loved staying at Tamarind Resort! It was our second visit to Nusa Lembongan and we were delighted to see that meanwhile, the island has gotten a real luxury hotel with beautiful rooms and two stunning infinity pools overlooking the bay. Service quality was really good and we had a great time. One thing that we really loved was the breakfast. We had booked with breakfast buffet which allowed us to choose two items from the menue plus coffee or tea and fruit juice. And they had so many healthy options available - all my favorite items (Avo on Toast, Smoothie Bowls) were possible and they prepared it with such a love to details. The second morning they even put my name on the bowl with little melon pieces! That was so lovely! We can warmly recommend this place for anyone who wants to visit Nusa Lembongan in style!"

"90.","Parrish Cooper","21","2019-01-09","5","Fantastic resort in so many ways; Location and views, staff (particularly in the attached restaurant Indica), and the best massage my partner and I have had in a long a time. The resort has been designed with impeccable detail and staff went above and beyond. We stayed in the Premium room for 4 nights and it was incredible with spectacular views from two angles, and a one bedroom villa for one night as the other room was booked. The villa was a bit disjointed and we actually preferred the regular rooms as they offer a larger more workable space and the bottom area of the villa has no a/c so was uncomfortable to hang out in. It also lacks privacy looking straight out onto the top pool. So if you're choosing between a regular room and villa, go regular room for sure... Biggest downside of this resort was access to water without buying disposable bottles. It would be great if they could offer water stations that you see everywhere at the local eateries. They put out small bottles every day in your room but environmentally a resort like this should be leading the way in providing options for refilling reusable bottles especially at the price. All in all, amazing place, and Pinkan, Mate, Mati and all the other staff were the best. All the housekeepers also had the biggest genuine smiles and they made this place into such a hospitable stay. Can't wait to visit again."

From the airport pick up - boat transfers- arrival and check in all went smoothly, without a hitch making our arrival to the island relaxed and stress free. The resort amenities are world class, with 3 pools, a new and versatile gym ( Life fitness equipment), beautiful spa and the resort restaurant Indica- serving both local and international cuisine. The rooms are very comfortable and spacious with exceptional views of the beach/ocean and beautiful Mt Agung. Our trip was made complete with the service from the staff at The Tamarind. The staff are friendly, welcoming and were willing to do that little bit extra to make our stay extra special. The Tamarind is something extra special on Nusa Lembongan, where you feel welcomed, nothing is too much trouble and it's so comfortable and accommodating it feels like a second home. My husband and I can't wait to come back!"
"95.","Marie Corcoran","229","2019-01-09","5","We spent 7 perfect nights at the Tamarind Resort. Everything about our stay was perfect. We arrived there pretty tired and a bit emotional having just left our families after a 4 week visit to Ireland. It had been 3 years since our last visit home. The greeting at the resort was great and the staff were very friendly. They met us at the ferry and drove us to the resort. Note: When returning to the mainland to go to the airport this is included in the cost of the ferry ticket. There will be a shuttle bus to bring you to the airport. We spend a lot of time at the infinity pool relaxing in the perfect weather. I would suggest that they could change the music up a bit more as listening to the same tune a million times a day did get a bit annoying. Breakfast was included in our stay and was delicious without fail every morning. I think we pretty much tried every item on it. Fresh juice and coffee topped it off. This resort is probably more suited to couples, we didnt' see many kids and I don't think there was a kids club. There is a small but adequate gym and a beauty spa (but I didn't use it so cannot comment on it) It is pricy for alcohol and food compared to outside but it is nice to relax with a Bintang by the pool. The beach and restaurants are only a short walk away and there is a beautiful warmth in the evening which means you dont need to wear a sweater. This is one of my favourite things! This was our first trip to Bali and we loved every minute. I would definitely recommend that you stay here"

"102.","Tayla Salas","23","2021-01-09","5","The staff at The Tamarind went above and beyond what we expected. We stayed here for our honeymoon and the most amazing time. Not to mention the incredible rooms, pool and food. The gym is also great. We would definitely recommend The Tamarind for anyone wanting to visit Nusa Lembongan."
"103.","Emma Germain","3","2020-01-09","5","My husband and I stayed here for two nights during our honeymoon and we absolutely loved the Tamarind Resort.

We definitely recommend staying here if you’re in the area."
"104.","Louise Runyard","16","2023-01-09","5","Just heaven. Highly highly recommend, I can't wait to come back! Excellent rooms, 3 pools, beautiful breakfast menu & coffees, bar, gym, spa... Everything you'd need. A few mins walk to the beach & restaurants options along the coastline. You can easily arrange everything you need through the staff."

"106.","catherine khraish","239","2024-01-09","5","It is a great resort. The service is a 5 star hotel service. They are very professional. The rooms, the pools and the food are really good. Our stay was so relaxing."
"107.","James Airdrie","2","2018-01-09","5","Having stayed at a number of top end hotels/resorts over the years my expectations of The Tamarind Resort were high. Considering this holiday was for my honeymoon I was absolutely looking for the top tier of luxury and all I can say is WOW! The Tamarind blew me away. The VIP fast track service through the airport, transfer from the airport to Sanur and then fast boat across to Nusa Lembongan all organised by the marvellous staff at The Tamarind. Having the guys organise all the transfers made our arrival effortless and stress free. This really set the tone for our stay. The staff were brilliant catering to all our needs. They even created a few cocktails for my wife allowing her to name them (very cool experience). The food was nothing short of delicious with The sirloin steak being absolutely perfect. Another detail to mention was the cookies we received each night as part of the turn down service. Now that is next level. Our room was exceptionally large with huge comfy beds and stunning bathrooms. The aircon was incredible creating a room temp that allowed you to snuggle under the covers. Nothing worse than a hot room were sleep is near impossible. This is not the case at The Tamarind. Attention to detail throughout the result is another aspect that set this resort apart from others we have stayed at. The pool! Wow! Breathtaking!' The size, the design and the view from it all unbelievable. Upon checking out the staff handled everything, we didn't have to touch our luggage once until we arrived at our next hotel. Truly first class. Our stay at The Tamarind was more than I could have hoped for. Comfortable, seamless, luxury, delicious and wow factor like no other. My wife and I CANNOT wait to return and do it all over again."
"108.","Virtual Stay","126","2020-01-09","5","Everything was Exceptional. No leaf un-turned. It's all the small things that make this one of our favourite shoots yet, there are just too many to mention. You'll have to go experience it for yourself What an honor to work with you ! This is not your ordinary resort. These guys go over and above in everything they do right down to spelling your name with fruits in your cereal. The granola is home made at the resort and an absolute must have. The eggs beny is also fantastic and probably the best if had to date. Spectacular. The spa is wonderful along with the lovely spa ladies at your command. One of the most spectacular spas we have seen on the island. The staff as you would expect are excellent. They will be at your call at any time and are more than happy to help you out with anything you need. The upstairs villa is also phenomenal. The views from up there are just unsurpassable. The pools are lovely and relaxing to swim in and are set at a great temperature to cool down after a hot day in the sun or at the beach. We really loved our stay here."

Kolam renang menawarkan pemandangan yang luar biasa—sungguh menyenangkan. Sarapannya sangat enak dan bervariasi, dan stafnya ramah, profesional, dan selalu tersenyum. Pujian khusus untuk Harry, yang sungguh menyenangkan! Saya juga mencoba pijat: pengalaman yang sangat menenangkan dengan kualitas yang luar biasa. Pusat kebugarannya sangat lengkap, dan lokasi hotelnya ideal, dekat dengan banyak restoran. Kami seharusnya menginap selama tiga hari… tetapi akhirnya kami menginap selama enam hari karena kami sangat menyukainya! Saya sangat merekomendasikan hotel ini!"
"174.","Irene Preusser","120","2025-12-09","5","Tamarind Resort di Nusa Lembongan adalah pilihan fantastis untuk menikmati pulau ini. Pelayanannya ramah dan selalu siap membantu, lokasinya sangat strategis, dan kamarnya nyaman serta menarik. Saya khususnya ingin menyoroti pelayanan yang luar biasa di restoran, di mana Devina melayani kami dengan sangat ramah dan profesional. Berkat dia, setiap hidangan terasa semakin istimewa. Sarapannya fantastis, dengan variasi yang baik dan kualitas yang tinggi. Pengalaman menginap yang sangat menyenangkan dan sangat direkomendasikan."

Dan ada penyewaan sepeda motor murah di dekatnya, yang juga bagus. Menyewa satu di hotel sangat mahal! ㅠㅠ! Kamarnya nyaman, dan yang terbaik, sarapan dan makanannya luar biasa... 👍 Fakta bahwa tidak ada batasan jumlah menu yang bisa dipesan untuk sarapan sangat memuaskan! Kolam renang memiliki tiga kedalaman berbeda, jadi kami sangat bersenang-senang. 👍 Kamar mandinya memiliki banyak air panas. Yang terbaik, sistem pembersihan kamar memastikan bahwa air dan handuk selalu tersedia saat tidak ada orang di kamar. 👍👍 Saya sangat puas dengan Tamarind Resort 🧚🏻‍♂️"
"180.","corrado cogliati","9","2025-06-09","5","Keramahan khas Bali yang terbaik. Mereka mengakomodasi semua permintaan kami, memanjakan kami, dan menjadikan pengalaman kami luar biasa. Kamarnya sangat luas dan memiliki pemandangan yang fenomenal. Sarapan a la carte-nya sungguh luar biasa kualitas dan penyajiannya. Kamar-kamarnya bersih dan terawat dengan baik. Semuanya sempurna."
"181.","MAGNANTE DELPHINe","113","2025-07-09","4","Hotel ini berlokasi bagus. Kami harus pindah kamar karena kamar pertama berisik, tetapi stafnya langsung setuju. Kamarnya memiliki fasilitas yang bagus tetapi agak ketinggalan zaman. Banyak tangga. Sarapannya lumayan. Namun, kami makan malam di hotel dan saya merasa sangat tidak enak badan. Saya melaporkannya saat check-out, tetapi petugasnya tampaknya tidak ramah. Hotelnya tidak terlalu ramai, dan kolam renangnya menyenangkan. Penghargaan khusus untuk Dea atas kebaikannya."
"182.","Léo Hauchecorne","73","2025-01-09","3","Hotel yang bagus, berlokasi strategis, sedikit di atas pusat kota. Kompleksnya sudah tua dan tampaknya terbengkalai secara bertahap (perabotan rusak, resepsionis kurang terawat, kolam renang hijau, dll.), yang sangat disayangkan karena hotel ini memiliki beberapa aset yang sangat bagus. Saya tidak punya keluhan apa pun tentang layanannya yang sangat baik. Skor 3/5 ini mencerminkan rasio kualitas/harga yang sangat buruk untuk hotel sekelas ini, dengan harga kamar sekitar €250. Kami tertipu oleh foto-foto yang menggoda di situs web, yang sayangnya tidak lagi mencerminkan kenyataan."
"183.","Kathi","67","2025-01-09","4","Secara keseluruhan, kami bersenang-senang di Tamarind. Namun, harus diakui, hotel ini sama sekali tidak seperti hotel bintang 5. Ada 3 kolam renang yang bagus, dan pemandangan teluknya fantastis. Stafnya juga sangat perhatian dan ramah. Sarapannya sebenarnya enak, tetapi Anda harus memilih satu menu, ditambah satu minuman hangat dan satu jus. Sisanya dikenakan biaya tambahan, yang menurut saya agak kurang ajar mengingat harganya. Anda kemudian dapat memilih makanan lain dari prasmanan, yang hanya menawarkan beberapa potong roti panggang, croissant, siput dengan selai, dan beberapa muesli. Selain itu, kamarnya agak kuno; tempat tidurnya berderit keras, dan kami mengalami sakit punggung setelah 4 malam menginap."
"184.","Thomas Lang","108","2025-01-09","5","Hotel yang sangat bagus dengan layanan yang sangat penuh perhatian, dan makanannya juga sangat lezat. Sayangnya, kami mengalami perut buncit saat bertamasya, jadi kami menghabiskan dua hari di kamar. Kami dilayani dengan sangat baik, dengan obat-obatan dan makanan ringan yang diantar ke kamar kami. Pemandangan indah dari balkon Gunung Agung dan laut di sampingnya. Pengaturannya, mulai dari transfer ke sana dan kembali ke DPS, sangat baik. Pantainya bisa dicapai dengan berjalan kaki."
"185.","오늘저녁은치킨이다","2","2025-05-09","1","Saya mengunjungi cabang hotel ini karena paling dekat dengan tempat saya bisa menyewa e-bike. Saya meminta mereka memanggilkan taksi untuk saya dalam perjalanan pulang, tetapi mereka menagih saya dua kali lipat tarif taksi untuk perjalanan pulang. ^^ Sejujurnya, tarif taksi di Lembongan tidak murah. ㅎ Dan saya bahkan tidak membayar langsung ke sopir taksi. Dia menagih saya dua kali lipat karena dia bilang sudah membayar. ^^^^ Ini pertama kalinya saya melihat hal seperti ini di hotel Lembongan. Saya mengeluh tentang hal itu, tetapi mereka bersikeras untuk mengambilnya. Stafnya sangat baik. Mereka tahu bahwa tidak ada apa-apa di sekitar hotel, jadi kami tidak punya pilihan selain naik taksi. ㅎ Layanan lainnya mungkin bagus, tetapi jika Anda orang Korea yang menginap di hotel ini, jangan pernah meminta mereka memanggilkan taksi untuk Anda. (Mereka bahkan menagih harga yang lebih tinggi kepada orang asing di belakang saya. Saya terkejut ketika mendengar harganya, dan dia sebenarnya seorang tamu.) Saya menulis ulasan ini untuk kebaikan publik. Jika Anda ingin meningkatkan PDB per kapita Lembongan, jangan ragu untuk memanggil taksi di sini."
"186.","Ilke Saels","19","2024-01-09","4","Hotel bintang 5 dengan staf yang sangat ramah dan berpengalaman. Putu, khususnya, pantas mendapatkan penghargaan atas pelayanannya dan kemampuannya mengingat nama tamu. Dia berpengetahuan luas, dan itu terlihat jelas. Hotel ini memiliki tiga kolam renang dan terletak di dekat pantai. Mereka menawarkan sopir dan tur ke tempat-tempat seperti Nusa Penida, termasuk perjalanan perahu. Sarapannya sangat enak. Namun, kamar-kamarnya perlu sedikit renovasi: banyak cat yang terkelupas, dinding yang retak, dan papan skirting yang hilang. Kamar mandinya juga tidak terlalu bersih (dengan banyak kerak kapur, di antara hal-hal lainnya). Kamar yang lebih hangat akan sangat membantu. Ini adalah hotel bintang 5 yang mulai kehilangan beberapa kualitas baiknya. Harganya juga cukup mahal dibandingkan dengan hotel lain."

"189.","Jennifer Park","67","2023-01-09","5","Semua staf ramah dan pelayanannya luar biasa. Meskipun ada beberapa ketidaknyamanan, semuanya ditangani dengan tepat. Dan sarapan nasi gorengnya sangat lezat. Burritonya juga lezat. Setiap fasilitas dan kamar bersih dan rapi, kecuali kolam renang di atap. Saya tidak terlalu suka berenang di kolam renang karena saya bisa mencium bau kimia. Namun, semua staf ramah dan memberikan pelayanan berkualitas tinggi. Ada beberapa masalah, tetapi mereka menanganinya dengan sangat baik. Nasi goreng, burrito, dan cappuccino untuk sarapan sangat lezat. Mereka juga menyajikan hidangan penutup saat makan malam, dan setiap hidangan penutupnya juga sangat lezat."

"198.","F MG","21","2019-01-09","1","Saya tidak akan pernah kembali ke hotel ini atau merekomendasikannya. Kurangnya staf dan layanan pelanggan tidak dapat diterima untuk hotel dengan harga lebih dari 200 euro per malam. Kami memberi tahu staf resepsionis bahwa kami akan berangkat bertamasya keesokan paginya dan perlu sarapan untuk dibawa pulang, karena sudah termasuk sarapan. Mereka memberi tahu kami bahwa kami bisa mengambilnya langsung di sana pukul 7:00 pagi, dan semuanya akan siap. Ketika kami turun pada waktu yang disepakati, tidak ada yang tahu apa-apa. Mereka mengatakan kepada kami bahwa kami seharusnya memberitahukannya di kafetaria sehari sebelumnya, tetapi kami punya waktu hingga pukul 6:00 sore untuk sarapan, jadi kami bisa melakukannya saat kami kembali. Kami tidak percaya apa yang kami dengar. Tidak ada permintaan maaf atau kompensasi yang ditawarkan... sungguh tidak dapat diterima. Kami akhirnya kehilangan uang sarapan kami karena ketidakmampuan mereka. Saya telah bepergian ke belahan dunia lain dan menginap di ribuan hotel yang lebih baik dari ini dengan setengah harga. Ada pilihan yang lebih baik di pulau ini."
