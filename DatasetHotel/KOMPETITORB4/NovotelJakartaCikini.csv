"1.","iing muttakhiroh","176","2025-12-23","5","If you’re looking for a hotel in Jakarta that’s close to HI and Gambir Station, but still affordable and comfortable, I definitely recommend this hotel. Everything about it feels just right—nothing excessive, nothing lacking. First of all, the location is our favorite. It’s surrounded by many great local and international dining options, the sidewalks are walkable, and the area is also nice for cycling. The roads aren’t too busy, making it easy and pleasant to explore the neighborhood. Secondly, the room is perfectly adequate. It’s not huge, but comfortable enough for two people. The bed is cozy, and the hot water and water pressure are excellent. The AC and amenities worked well and met our expectations. The staff are very friendly and responsive. Breakfast has a decent variety and is good enough to start the day. As for the restaurant (Food Exchange), the quality is quite average, but it’s not a big issue since there are so many great food options just steps away. Overall, this is one of the best Accor group hotels for its value. With the price you pay, you definitely get more than what you expect. We truly enjoyed our stay here."
"2.","Nurul Ainna Manaf","125","2025-12-09","5","Had a pleasant stay at Novotel Cikini. a cozy weekend escape right in the heart of the city. I loved their king-size bed paired with the warm soft carpet, making the room feel extra comforting. The soft sunlight, the lighting, the mirror everywhere, and the transparent glass divider between the room & bathroom added another chic element to the overall design. Our window view was beautiful day and night! And my son was especially happy because there was a game in the lobby that instantly became his favorite. If there’s one thing we didn’t love, it was the TV! no YouTube for my son, hahaha. But aside from that, everything else hit the mark. The food was superb! flavorful, satisfying, and definitely one of the highlights of our stay. Overall, a warm, comfortable, and memorable stay at Novotel Cikini. Would definitely consider coming back for another weekend reset💛✨"
"3.","Shalma Virula","5","2025-12-23","4","I stayed one night at Nov Hotel Cikini and had a comfortable stay. I arrived at night and the check-in process was smooth. The room was clean, comfortable, and nicely designed. The room is also good for taking photos. Drinking water was provided for two people, with two large bottles (around 1 liter each). The room facilities were complete, including an iron and ironing board. There were enough power outlets, including 3-pin sockets, which was very helpful. The TV provided various channels such as Cartoon Network, HBO, and other international channels. The room was soundproof, so it was quiet and comfortable for sleeping. The bed was comfortable and I slept well. The bathroom has a transparent glass partition between the bed area and the shower, and it can be covered if needed. I stayed on the 15th floor with an east-facing view and could see the city from the room. Breakfast had many options, including Middle Eastern food like mandi rice. There were also fun features such as a cotton candy machine and a chocolate fondue fountain. Some of the food tasted good. When I wanted to eat a whole pear, the staff kindly helped me cut it. The hotel was quite busy, with many guests attending meetings even on Saturday. The location is strategic, close to Taman Ismail Marzuki, Metropole, and nice areas around Cikini for walking. There is a swimming pool that can be used by children and is also suitable for sunbathing. The hotel also has a gym, although I didn’t have time to use it. Next to the hotel, there is a gas station with a mini market and Kopi Kenangan. Overall, it was a pleasant and comfortable stay, suitable for a 4-star hotel."
"4.","Anggi Ramdhan","1","2025-12-23","5","Pertama kali saya tiba di Novotel, saya langsung disambut dengan sapaan yang ramah oleh petugas di area car checking dan di lobby. Pelayanan yang diberikan sangat baik. Selanjutnya, saya menuju ke ruang meeting dan bertemu dengan petugas security, Bapak M. Ridawan, yang dengan ramah mengarahkan serta membantu mengantarkan saya ke ruang meeting yang dituju 🙏"
"5.","Nicholas BD","76","2025-12-30","4","Decent hotel in the center of Jakarta, near point of interests. I like the bed, had high quality sleep. Got the top floor and the view is really good. Room for improvement is the TV, kinda outdated. No netflix, can't play movie from USB. Luckily I brought hdmi cable with my laptop for this Flixcation."
"6.","Sri Ayu Ramadhani","6","2025-12-23","5","Staf ramah, pelayanan oke. Saya berkali-kali pesan onlineshop dan dilayani dengan baik. Kamar bersih dan rapi. Jika ada kebutuhan ini itu staf akan segera mengantarkan ke kamar anda. Next, kalau ada perjalanan lagi akan kembali ke sini lagi."
"7.","Mursyidah Sholihati","91","2025-12-06","5","I have been bringing international speakers to stay here for the past two years. Located in the heart of the city, the place offers a strategic location, although the surrounding area can be a bit busy. All the facilities are well maintained and comfortable, making it a place worth returning to. The food is delicious, and the service is excellent, their staff are friendly, attentive, and professional. Overall, it has consistently provided a pleasant experience, and I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a convenient and enjoyable stay in the city center."
"8.","deadyrizky","319","2025-12-16","5","Selalu menyenangkan nginep sini. Pelayanan ramah banget. Kamarnya gak mengecewakan. Kasur empuk dan ac dingin. Barang temen saya hilang aja sampe dicariin via cctv sama security. Makanan juga enak semua. Full kenyang! Kekurangan paling cuman 2. Lobinya gak ramah disabilitas yah. Soalnya berundak... Sama parkirnya ampun sempit banget. Juga spacenya gak banyak"
"9.","Ipad Air","7","2025-12-16","5","Really good hotel. Like all the other Novotels around the world, it feels just like home. I can recommend the breakfast — there is plenty of choice, and you can even create your own nasi. There’s also a wide selection of fresh fruit. The breakfast staff are very friendly, especially Caca. I also love the rooftop swimmingpool and the view from the room."
"10.","zidna fitri","8","2025-11-06","4","The location is strategic, and the food at the restaurant is good. If you want to dine out, there are affordable options nearby. The staff are very friendly and helpful, but the security or bellboy was not at their post when my group and I arrived at the hotel, so I had to carry my luggage on my own from the taxi. I conduct meetings here, and the banquet staff is very helpful, even though a small issue occurred during my meeting."
"11.","Bugar Medika","1","2026-01-01","5","Terimakasih banyak pada Bapak General Manager dan Staff untuk pelayanan yang ramah dan baik. Kamar besar, bersih dan rapi. Makanan enak dan bervariasi. PT.Bugar Sehat Medika"
"12.","TU Pantyarso","3","2025-12-23","5","Berkesempatan meeting beberapa kali disini. Para pegawainya ramah dan membantu, makan siang bervariasi dan cukup enak, terutama ikan laut. Kesempatan terakhir bertemu Mbak Yanti dalam meeting terakhir."
"13.","Swatantra Wibawa Mukti","256","2025-11-06","4","Stay di Novotel cikini karena ada event konser dekat dari sini.. lokasi hotel nya strategis banget, nyaman, modern, bersih dengan ruangan yg spacious..pertama datang langsung di kasih welcome drink, namun ada hal yang sepertinya harus di perhatikan untuk room nya, seperti ada gorden putih lapis pertama yg robek, pinggiran mirror kamar mandi yang ada bercak - bercak noda karat. Untuk sarapan ya biasa saja menurut saya (mungkin ada menu yg kurang pas di lidah aja 😅), tapi cukup puas lah. Ammenities nya sudah tidak ada ya karena menerapkan go green atau bagaimana bingung juga.. pelayannya ramah, dan sangat helpfull.. Terima kasih 🙏"
"14.","Aldsshop Aldsshop","1","2025-12-09","5","We stayed for a staycation, and Novotel Cikini was a very suitable place for our family. A family with three children. It's close to the city center, so everything is easily reachable just by walking and enjoying the evening or morning. There are also many activities within the hotel: the swimming pool is kids-friendly, and they have various kids' activities like coloring, a mini playground, playing gasing (traditional spinning top), decorating cupcakes, and making drinks. The staff is very friendly, and the room is clean and fragrant. We are considering a repeat staycation here."
"15.","saleha ali","80","2025-11-06","4","Room was comfortable and spacious. Bathroom needed a little maintenance which I’m sure the hotel is aware of. Buffet breakfast was perfect every morning with a great variety. Hotel staff were always very warm, welcoming and super friendly. Location was relatively good; not too far from other malls and markets. We appreciated staying between the locals rather than tourist hotspots. We did a couple spa on the first day and I would not recommend it at all; the 2 masseuse were rather unprofessional (walked in while we were changing), the rooms were unprepared for our sessions, one of the masseuse kept walking out to attend to something else in between, the room looked like a bedroom turned to massage room, and the massage itself was below average. Was very disappointed. Otherwise, our overall stay was very pleasant."

The kitchen was amazing, as I have many allergies, and they took special care to make sure I had food I could eat at every meal. The staff always remembered my name and smiled. The rooms were clean and well taken care of. I would highly recommend this hotel!"
"19.","Rafly Gilang","15","2025-11-06","5","I stayed at Novotel for 3.5 months for a business trip and everything was amazing. The staff was so friendly and responsive to my request. The breakfast choice was a lot and tasty. However, the only complaint I have is that the placement of the pool. It's on the 5th floor where conference rooms are also located. So, sometimes, I would see employees from other companies chilling in the pool area, and I couldn't comfortably swim. But other than that, everything was great. I look forward to stay with them again!"

"30.","Farah Chaliq","6","2025-08-06","3","- Desain kamar bagus modern bersih, tapi sayang amenities provided by request untuk mensupport go-green (menurut saya jaman sekarang bisa bikin amenities ramah lingkungan). Yang aneh lagi listrik di kamar 24 jam mati nyala mati nyala, baru ini bangettt stay hotel berbintang listrik kek di mainin hantu🥲 Please fix it. - Breakfast limited options dan rasanya mohon maaf tidak cocok di lidah saya yg tergolong gak rewel juga. Telur rebus dan topping2 bubur ayam ada hint agak tidak enak di lidah. Grilled veggies juga gak cocok. Somehow tamu lain cocok2 aja kali ya? -Early check in free dengan syarat regist member Accord ya, yaa oke lah walau nunggu sedikit lebih lama dari check in biasa (disaat dikejar jadwal meeting, kecuali kalo lagi luang gak masalah)."

"91.","Anisa Septiani","1","2025-08-06","4","so happy bisa mencoba pengalaman baru mengadakan event di Novotel Jakarta Cikini, overall cukup memuaskan. Namun ada beberapa catatan dari kami.. masih ada beberapa staff yang kurang sigap dan kurang helpful di lapangan entah itu dari team receptionist maupun banquet. Namun tetap ada juga staff yang nice dari segi service nya khususnya Mba Tazkia (banquet team), sangat membantu, ramah, dan responsif—benar-benar support banget dari awal sampai events selesai. Untuk ruang meeting Merapi, proyektornya kurang maksimal karena ruangan cukup terang, jadi tampilan kurang jelas. Selain itu, penempatan coffee break di dalam ruangan agak mengganggu karena ada suara mesin kopi dan lalu-lalang staf saat persiapan. Semoga bisa jadi masukan ke depannya. thankyou atas kerjasamanya!"

"97.","Amanda Ratih","224","2025-08-06","4","Dari segi kamar aku merekomendasikan, kami menginap berlima 3 dewasa, 2 anak kecil dengan ekstra bed. Walaupun ada ekstra bed kamarnya ga terlihat sempit krn masih ada spot untuk solat. Amenities cukup lengkap, dikamar jg disediakan meja setrika, setrika dan mesin kopi, sebuah amenities yg jarang terlihat utk hotel setara Novotel. AC sangat dingin. Tp ada kurangnya nih, Sayang bgt untuk kamar mandi hanya tertutup tirai dan gampang terlihat dari luar melalui sela2, trs pintu kamar mandi yg kurang privacy krn ga ada kuncinya huhuhu.. City light Jakarta juga keren bngt klo malem dr sini. Fasilitas lain yg kurang pas penempatan, area bisnis yang satu jalur dgn fasilitas spa, kolam renang dan gym. Agak malu ye.. Mondar mandir basah2 ngelewatin pekerja kantoran yg sedang rapat, kenapa ga ditempatkan pd lantai khusus gtu loh 😭😭😭 Tapi utk makanan aku kurang suka, failed masakannya, bnyk yg kurang bumbu, terlalu berminyak dan ga pas dilidah. Dekat dgn banyak Museum, krn Cikini ga jauh dr Menteng. Di luar hotel bnyk jajanan jadul yg kalo dicoba rasanya enak2 semua 🥰🥰"

"109.","Thamara","1","2025-08-06","4","Secara keseluruhan, pengalaman kami di Novotel Cikini cukup baik. Kami sangat mengapresiasi kerja sama dari tim banquet, khususnya Mba Tazkia yang sangat helpful, ramah, responsif, dan kooperatif selama persiapan hingga hari-H acara. Pelayanan beliau sangat membantu kelancaran acara kami. Namun, ada beberapa hal yang menjadi catatan bagi kami. Kami menemukan beberapa staf hotel yang kurang helpfull dan kurang cekatan dalam merespons kebutuhan di lapangan. Untuk fasilitas ruang meeting Merapi, menurut kami perlu adanya pembaruan, khususnya pada proyektor. Dengan kondisi ruangan yang cukup terang, hasil proyeksi tampak kurang jelas dan menyulitkan peserta untuk menyimak presentasi. Selain itu, dari segi layout, kami menilai penempatan coffee break sebaiknya di luar ruangan. Coffee break yang berada dalam satu ruangan dengan meeting cukup mengganggu, terutama dari suara mesin kopi dan aktivitas keluar-masuk staf saat menyiapkan konsumsi. Demikian review dari kami, semoga dapat menjadi masukan untuk peningkatan layanan ke depannya. Terima kasih atas kerjasamanya."

The rooms are large and well equipped with a comfortable bed and desk. My only critique would be the glass window to the shower and toilet, this is awkward if staying with others. The pool and gym is located on the fifth floor, the pool is adequate. Service throughout the hotel is fantastic, the staff are friendly and jovial. The bar downstairs is a great place to have a beer or drink. They did run out of beer on multiple days, leaving only Heineken. There is a massage service within the hotel which is well priced and convenient. Location is good with bars, restaurants and fast food close by."

But the room sound proof is not excellent. I could hear noises from cars and trains while resting at night. The staff are friendly, however, I didn’t receive anything more despite spending my actual birthday in the hotel. At the minimum, a wish? A card? Nothing. Welcome drink is limited to guava or apple juice. The breakfast selection was decent but I didn’t find the selection suitable for my liking. I feel the hotel could have done something more. Not an excellent stay."

We recently stayed at Novotel Cikini Jakarta, and I can confidently say it was one of the best family vacations we've had! From the moment we arrived, the staff was incredibly welcoming and attentive, making us feel right at home. The hotel is very kid-friendly, with spacious family rooms that comfortably accommodated our family of four. The highlight for our kids was the Kids’ Club, where they enjoyed a variety of fun activities, from arts and crafts to games. It gave us some much-needed downtime to relax by the pool while knowing our children were having a blast! Speaking of the pool, it was clean and well-maintained, perfect for a refreshing dip after a day of exploring the city. The hotel also offers a great selection of dining options. We were pleasantly surprised by the variety of meals available, catering to both adults and kids. The breakfast buffet was a hit, with plenty of delicious choices to fuel our adventures. The location is also a plus, with easy access to nearby attractions and parks, making it convenient to explore Jakarta with the family. Overall, our experience at Novotel Cikini was fantastic! If you're looking for a family-friendly hotel with lots of fun activities and great meals, I highly recommend this place. We can't wait to return!"

"305.","Sunan Kanjeng","303","2025-07-06","5","Salah satu Hotel keren di Jakarta dengan harga layak. Resepsionis sangat helpful, petugas rata rata ramah dari satpam sampai attendant kolam renang. Kebersihan sempurna, tekanan air memuaskan. Paling istimewa adalah menu sarapan, melebihi ekspektasi. Tersedia menu makanan yg sangat Asian oriented, rasanya pun enak. Saya sudah jarang menikmati hotelnya ketika berada di hotel, tapi kali ini saya menikmati berbagai fasilitas, kolam renang ( terlalu kecil untuk saya, tapi acceptable ), fitness center. Mbah Indah ( sesusi name tag ) ramah dan profesional melayani. Petugas concierge pun ramah, cekatan, rapi menghandel tas, koper dan barang lain. Tersedia kamar smoking room, juga tersedia smoking space di resto. Recommeded to stay. Hanya saja lokasinya di wilayah macet Jakarta. Tapi menarik karena masih bisa menemukan street food di sekitar hotel. Untuk liburan gateway pun bagus, karena deket dengan berbagai lokasi belanja iconic, thamrin city, tanah abang dan SCBD. Satu pesan untuk para Tamu : Ambil makanan sesuai daya tampung perut, agar mengurangi jumlah makanan terbuang."

Lokasi strategis. Dekat ke Monas dan Stasiun Gambir. Kekurangan yg saya alami: pada saat check in, mungkin karena pengunjung datang bersamaan, waktu check in cukup lama. Kemudian saat masuk kamar, tidak ada air mineral, tp setelah sy telpon ke resepsionis, dengan cepat air mineral diantarkan ke kamar. Semoga di lain kesempatan bisa menginap lg di Novotel."

Dirubah desain jadi dua kmr mandi (1 wc dan wastafel, 1 shower dan wastafel) 2. Kaca yg transparat (WC dan SHOWER) dikasihkan stiker blur/buram, agar saat ada org tiba2 masuk kmr mandi, gak lgsg lihat yg sedang bab/mandi, (krn ini kmr mandi akses ny 2 pintu😣) sebetulnya wc dan shower ny bisa dipakai bersamaan 2 org, tp krn gada stiker blur/buram jd nya kamar mandi sebesar itu hanya bisa di pakai 1 org.."

"580.","Gillar Megantara","19","2025-05-06","4","Saya menginap 1 malam tgl 18/4/2025, 2 kamar. Plus: dikasih early check in jam 12:00 siang, ada welcome drink :) Pengalaman kurang menyenangkan: 1. Ketika check-in tidak ditanyakan apakah membawa kendaraan pribadi atau tidak. Biasanya karcis parkir akan di stempel atau didaftarkan di system sehingga gratis ketika check-out. Alhasil ketika check-out dan scan barcode karcis, ada tagihan IDR. 105rb. Untungnya petugas parkir menyarankan utk kembali ke FO dan didaftarkan. 2. Terkait FnB, saya pesan room service minuman namun yang datang tidak sesuai yg dipesan. Ketika ditanyakan ke pengantar makanan, minumannya habis. Artinya FnB mengganti pesanan tanpa konfirmasi. Tetap kami ambil dan bayar. 3. Ketika check-out, kami menanyakan ke tim front office di lobby, dimana akses ke parkiran lewat lobby. tidak ada jawaban (ignorance). Akhirnya, kami keluar lewat pintu depan. Semoga menjadi catatan dan improvement point ke depannya. Terimakasih."

"696.","ratri natarini","10","2025-01-22","1","Diluar ekspektasi, ternyata hotel sekelas Novotel memiliki kebijakan dan pelayanan front desk (resepsionis) yg mengecewakan. Pengalaman saya, pada saat akan check in untuk 2 kamar connecting di hari Jumat tgl 3 Januari. Saat itu 1 kamar saya sdh bisa check in sementara utk kamar connecting yg seharusnya saya mendapat kamar tsb pada pukul 14.00, saya baru memperoleh kamar tsb di pukul 16.00. Yang membuat saya sangat kecewa adalah saat petugas front desk wanita pada saat itu (mbak resepsionis) mengatakan penghuni kamar sebelumnya adalah member Accor sehingga bisa check out di pukul 14.00 dan kamar baru akan siap si pukul 15.00 seolah itu adalah hal yg harus saya terima dan maklumi krn mungkin saya bukan member Accor (?) Pada saat itu saya oke kan utk dpt kamarnya di pukul 15.00 , namun kenyataannya tidak sesuai yg dijanjikan. Ketika saya menanyakan ke mbak resepsionis by phone pukul 14.30 mbak tsb dengan suara kurang friendly kembali mengatakan krn penghuni kamar sebelah adalah member maka saya baru bisa check in di pukul 15.00. Akhirnya pd pukul 15.15 saya menanyakan kembali langsung di lobby, mbak tsb menyatakan saat itu penghuni nya susah check out tetapi saya tetap belum bisa check in krn kamar sedang dalam perbaikan (wastafel rusak), dimana saya merasa agak aneh krn ketika saya lewat depan kamar tsb tdk ada petugas atau siapapun yg tampak dikamar tsb. Tapi mbak resepsionis bersikukuh dan malah meminta saya pindah kamar ke lantai lain saja (yg dalam kondisi saya sulit dan tdk memungkinkan krn saya bersama Ayah saya yg sakit dan harus menggunakan kursi roda untuk mobilisasi), dan sepertinya sdh tdk ada solusi lain buat saya saat itu. Ketika saya akhirnya kembali ke kamar utk persiapan pindah lantai dan meminta concierge menunjukkan kamar dimaksud utk melihat kerusakan wastafelnya, dilift saya bertemu dengan penghuni kamar dimaksud dan dia menegur dan meminta maaf kepada saya krn dia late check out (krn sepertinya dia mendengar saya complain di lobby) dan saya mengetahui kalau ternyata kamar tsb tdk ada kerusakan sama sekali dan penghuni tsb memang belum check out bahkan belum packing dan itu sudah posisi dipukul 15.30, yg mana akhirnya saya terpaksa baru dapat kamar tsb di pukul 16.00 itupun harus dengan effort yg luar biasa krn saya harus menghadapi ketidakramahan petugas resepsionis yg memberikan saya informasi tdk benar (berbohong soal kerusakan wastafel). Pd akhirnya ada permintaan maaf dari manajemen dengan mengirimkan buah potong dan saya dibolehkan check out dipukul 15.00. Sejujurnya bukan itu yg saya inginkan, krn saya hanya ingin saya dilayani dengan baik dengan kejujuran dan keramahan. Karena terus terang saya merasa diremehkan hanya krn saya bukan member Accor dan krn diawal saya juga menanyakan tentang diskon2 rate hotel. Diluar itu saya cukup puas dengan keramahan petugas lainnya seperti security, concierge, breakfast serta kebersihan kamar. Mudah2an selanjutnya Novotel Cikini bisa memperbaiki sistem reservasi agar lbh tepat memberikan kepuasan kepada pelanggan serta meningkatkan standard pelayanan front desk yang lbh baik."

When i got back at 9:00 pm our luggage was still in the lobby!!!!! and when i told them about it they said its here because i left before entering the rooms!

You prioritized satisfying their request in the expense of delaying our agreed check in time that I paid for. We had to wait for 30 minutes in thr lobby. We already had a long day traveling with a 5-month old baby and just wanted to go to our rooms but had to wait in the lobby for another 30 minutes. To add to that, you didn't even offer us a welcome drink while we waited at the lobby, I had to ask for one."

"702.","Aji Maulana","20","2025-01-22","1","I stayed for 2 nights. The facilities and everything were extremely top-notch. However, during my last night staying there, I had the worst experience. After my workout in the gym at 11 PM, I walked across the pool to return to my room. A man was lying on the sunbed, staring at his phone. I thought he was rubbing his feet. Turned out he was stroking his genital. In disbelief, I was frozen and speechless. There was no one else around, so I just stood there. A moment later, I felt sick and rushed back to my room. There was no staff and no CCTV around. I was too hesitant to report the whole thing because there was no evident. I do really hope for Novotel to increase the CCTV coverage area."

Sofa had an hole inside, AC not properly working, bathroom smelling strong rotten odor that diffuse in all the room, they couldn't do worst I think. Ok, bed was huge and comfy, service was ok (i asked for a second blanket and they gave it to me), service have the standard you would expect but if you can't breath into your room because it's too cold, air isn't filtered, all furnitures are smelly and / or burnt in some places, and bathroom diffuse a very strong rotten sewage smell, it's doesn't really matter if the service is good.

I order honey chicken salad, it came in 30 minutes, the chicken is cold (i dont know whether it is supposed to be served that way), and on the serving tray i found pepper and salt container, when I took one of them, it containes water (God knows what kind of water that is) and the other container was empty even the lid on the bottom was missing. 3. I asked for omellete (14/11) it never came, i asked the staff he said that he needed to get matches to light up his stove 4.

I don't recommend this hotel. Things to be considered: the policy to use hotel's facilities actually weird and limiting people / family that aimed to have staycation / WFH. You need to book reservation to swim (and this is ok), however you mostly will not have any chance to swim. Why? As I checked to the staff, they mentioned only guest(s) on one room could use the pool at their reserved time. Confused? Let me explain the example: guest in room 001 can use the pool at 7 AM as they reserved, and around that time only guest on that room whom able to use it. Can you imagine if all the rooms were booked, then not all people could use the pool then? If the pool's operational hour is 12 hours then only 12 guest(s) can swim on their pool. It's better if Novotel reconsider their policy again. I knew some better hotel that have even greater policy in using hotel's facilities tho. Another disastrous thing during my stay dated 14 Nov. The electricity totally went out in the afternoon. COME ON NOVOTEL, REALLY?????? The TV where I was staying also sucks (do not let the receptionist giving you room 1117). It always went off every 4 minutes, and it was annoying bzzzzz hahahaha The only thing I like from Novotel are the bed and the helpful housekeeping staff. Thanks!"

"774.","S","34","2024-01-22","1","Sangat mengecewakan. Saya memilih Novotel setelah pengalaman buruk saya baru-baru ini di beberapa hotel Mercure. Saya pikir dengan harga 25% lebih mahal, kualitasnya tetap sama. Ternyata tidak, Anda membayar lebih untuk kehilangan kualitas. Pertama-tama: - Handuk yang disediakan robek dan rusak. - Bau rokok yang menyengat, meskipun lantainya bebas asap rokok. Tapi bau ini langsung tercium begitu keluar lift. - AC-nya sangat buruk. Saya menurunkannya ke 16°C dan menunggu berjam-jam untuk mendapatkan suhu ruangan yang nyaman; mungkin sekitar 22-23°C. - Lantainya penuh noda dan kotoran. - Ada jamur. - Sarapannya kurang bervariasi, dan hidangan atau lauk yang sudah kosong tidak akan diisi ulang kecuali Anda mengejar pelayan. Tapi yang terpenting adalah hotel ini memang dirancang untuk menyelenggarakan pertemuan bisnis. Untuk mencapai kolam renang di lantai 5, Anda harus melintasi seluruh lantai, melewati sekitar sepuluh ruang pertemuan. Waktu rehat rokok dan kopi selama pertemuan ini juga berlangsung di depan kolam renang. Anda akan mendapati 20 orang, merokok, menatap Anda, dan bertanya-tanya mengapa Anda berjemur di tepi kolam renang. Nah, itulah inti dari keberadaan kolam renang. Secara keseluruhan, hotel ini memang ditujukan untuk organisasi-organisasi seperti ini dan oleh karena itu mengabaikan tamunya yang hanya ingin menginap dan bersantai. Kekecewaan lain dari grup Accor; grup ini seharusnya membenahi hotel-hotelnya di Indonesia. Cobalah Mercure, yang berjarak 200 meter; saya rasa mereka tidak bisa lebih buruk lagi. Satu-satunya hal positif adalah stafnya melakukan yang terbaik."

"787.","Tim","101","2025-03-22","2","Our experience at this hotel was very sub-standard. The deluxe king room had a stained carpet and all sorts of crumbs from the previous guests. In addition, the A/C would not work - at check-in and on a sheet in the room, they announced repair works on the hotel-wide A/C system in the afternoon, for which air conditioning would not be available for some hours. This in itself was a major inconvenience but the hotel management made no efforts to proactively offer any compensation. We informed the reception staff of the shortcomings in cleanliness and asked for housekeeping to vacuum our room. Upon returning several hours later in the evening, some of the crumbs had been removed but some still remained. The A/C still was not functioning at all. We asked reception for the A/C to be repaired immediately. A maintenance guy showed up with tools and a ladder and worked without success for what seemed like ages, while the door was open and every passerby could look into our room - great respect for guests’ privacy. After more than half an hour in which we sat uncomfortably in our open room waiting for the repair to succeed, they finally realized that the maintenance guy would not be able to fix the issue and decided to give us a different room instead, an executive junior suite on the same floor. At almost midnight we finally got a room with a working a/c. Based on the cleanliness issues and their unsatisfactory follow-up plus the maintenance problems and the delay in providing an alternative solution we unfortunately cannot recommend this hotel."

The gym and the pool are located on the 5th floor where the meeting rooms are. The pool is small and you can't really do a lap swim. The gym is also small with limited exercise machines. To go to the gym and pool, you need to walk past all the meeting rooms, and the entire 5th floor smells like pee - you read it correctly; the area smells like people had peed on the floor of the 5th floor or the floor of the restrooms. It was so terrible that I never went back to the gym again because I didn't want to walk past that hallway/area on the 5th floor. The floor of the breakfast area was also VERY greasy, and it was a hazardous area, especially if you wear high heels; you could easily slip and fall down. I wore my sneakers, and I could literally skid with my sneakers on - clearly a very unsafe place. The food was mediocre and meh, and I ended up not eating breakfast there because the food didn't look good, and the choices were limited. Overall, I give Novotel Cikini 2 stars, no more. If you are a budgeted traveler, I'm sure you could find a nicer place at a similar rate elsewhere in the area."

Receptionists do not respond to requests. a huge request to the hotel management to change your attitude towards your customers. this is not the first time we stay in this chain of hotels, but it is in this place that we don’t want to stay anymore. we are a family with two children, 5 years and 7 months old, settled in a smoking room, with a persistent smell of cigarettes, although upon check-in they said that the room was for non-smokers"

Masa saya cuma photo2 aja dicurigain dikira mau ngapain sampe2 saya dengar sendiri semua security yang lagi tugas diinformasiin untuk nyelidikin saya. Woi SECURITY TOLOLLLL, udah tau gw tamu terus apa salah kalo gw photo2 untuk gw abadiin kalo gw pernah berkunjung ke itu hotel ?? Lalu kalo ada turis dari luar menginap disana terus photo2 juga, apa lo mau perlakukan seperti itu juga ?? Mikir otak lo 😡😡 Ga usah buka sekalian hotel itu kalo ga mau diphoto2. Untuk pihak management tolong ditindaklanjuti security2 seperti itu, jangan sampai hotel itu tutup seperti hotel di sebelahnya hanya karena perlakuan dari securitynya ....."

"804.","Chachi Lin","1","2024-01-22","2","I had bad service experiences during my 3nights stays. I took my son to stay at this hotel for his birthday during Lebaran Holidays from 20th April to 23 April. When I checked in on the 20th, I asked the receptionist that I took my son for his birthday during the stay, is the hotel able to have a complement cake, just a slice will be fine with me. I even showed my son's passport to show that I wasn't lying. The receptionist said no problem to me and she took my son's passport for data. And on day that was my son's birthday, we not received the complement cake at all. So if the hotel didn't have this kind of service, please talked to the customer at the very beginning. Secondly, I drove a car from Bandung and stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. At the last night, when I came back to hotel at night around 10pm, the security told me that the parking areas were full and told me to do valet parking at opposite building. At that moment I felt weird and asked my brother to get down from the car to check at hotel's parking spots, whether no spots at all? Turned out there are still couple of empty spots inside the hotel. So make me felt like the hotel securities were cooperated with the securities at the opposite building so that they could get bonus money for people who parked the car over there."

Rapat di adakan di Hotel Novotel Cikini Jakarta. Desain kamarnya cukup menarik dan bagus tapi sangat disayangkan ruangan seperti ruang gravitasi alias kedap udara dan jendela kamar tidak bisa di buka, pelayanan kamarpun tidak memiliki kecakapan yang profesional layaknya pelayanan Hotel, dan yang lebih parah lagi dimana rasa lelah, dan butuh rileks atau santai setelah rapat perlu penyegaran otak, duduk di ruang outdoor Lt.2 ruang makan ketika ingin meminta kopi pada jam 11 malam pelayan hotel mengatakan: kopi hanya disediakan di meeting room, hati saya mengatakan: Lt.2 ini kan ruang breakfast, lunch dan dinner hanya kopi saja harus ada di meeting room.. miris hati saya. Kemudian, Acara rapat pleno pun berjalan lancar dan setelah keluar dari ruang rapat tepatnya untuk makan siang di berikan nasi kotak di luar aula layanknya orang habis menghadiri acara yasinan atau bacaan manakiib klo malam jumat... huuuff.. saya berharap, untuk kedepannya tolong...

After putting our luggages we went to get afternoon tea at around 17:15. We waited for an hour but foods that we ordered didn’t come out. We asked the staff and their response only “saya coba cek ke dapur” however no updates / any words from them so we just left dissatisfied and offended. Next morning we tried their bfast and the buffet was a bit off. Food selection was weird like nasi goreng paired with ayam opor?? Thats the only protein you get. Ofc they have eggs station but ayam opor being the only protein to pair with nasi goreng was off. We stayed for 3 nights and breakfast selections and taste was not good. We don’t even bother to give their afternoon tea a second try. It was kinda weird too when I get asked to google review the housekeeper team during my first night at the hotel like I still have 2 nights left, why in a rush for google reviews? They even asked my email as their spv would check. Dea and Talia was polite and their work met the standard however, when they mentioned about mini bar is refilled daily, they didn’t refill our mini bar that day. So the next day I asked the male housekeeper to refill it. Though our junior suite is surprisingly big and front staff was kind enough to help me get my online delivery to our room."

Bagi yang membawa kendaraan dan cuma mengikuti kegiatan di hotel ini (tidak menginap), siap-siap kecewa seperti saya. Hotel tidak memberikan layanan free-parking. Hotel hanya memberikan tarif flat parking sebesar Rp. 10.000. Untuk yang mengikuti kegiatan, di ballroom hotel menyediakan gelas dan jug sebagai teko. Entah bersih atau tidak, tapi saya menemukan beberapa jug yang ada bekas kerak-kerak seperti tidak disikat saat dibersihkan. Jadi saya sarankan untuk membawa tumbler sendiri yang sudah terisi air."

Whatever we ordered never came, even if it's just ice cubes. I eventually made multiple calls for the ice cubes, and finally it came, but in small amount. The front desk also offered some toiletries when we checked in but they never came. I asked about the toiletries again in the morning, and again they never came. I don't think the service people really keen to do any service. Worth to mention: to our horror, the bidet handle was disgustingly full with poop. I don't think the room cleaner pays much attention to critical spots. Breakfast is probably the highlight of the hotel, filled with great drinks (coffee, hot choco, smoothies, etc), decent fruits and some very good grilled veggies. The dimsum is horrible, tempura is super oily, and the oden is rather tasteless filled with only daikon and carrot. The continental food section is rather good, and the croissants are very enjoyable. The Indonesian food section looks kinda ok but I didn't get the chance to try it. Parking is super super horrible with very tight space, especially on the up and down ramps, and the number of space is super limited. Is it good place to stay?

The sales person refused to cancel the booking for the room even though only for 1 day, we have informed in the morning of arrival. Is it just because we had paid in advance? Well maybe we should just issue CL in the future...... Or simply change hotel! 2. Toiletries are on request, so when I asked for it, it took a merely more than 30 minutes to be delivered. 3. Some food items on lunch buffet were not displayed hot, the warmers were visibly off. 4. Asked for pork bacon for breakfast...the staff looked at me with an amazed expression and seemed confused. It is just bacon! A standard western breakfast...... 5. Asked for a paper cup and the staff need to have her manager permission and came back that I can't have paper cup, because food from buffet can not be taken away...... It is a papercup! Not a take away lunch box! Can I not have a hot coffee on the go? I guess the treatment will be different if the foreigner guess ask...... A cup of hot coffee will be wonderful to accompany the mad-traffic in Jakarta. They said food from buffet cannot be taken away, while I saw some family packed fresh fruits and other brings bakeries out......... Oh well maybe they they don't want to give A paper cup because it's just too costly....... 6. An evening earlier I asked to borrow bottle opener from the lobby bar (I brought my bottle downstairs so I have no intention to bring the opener to my room......) the bar staff asked me to go to restaurant to get bottle opener..... So I went up the restaurant, and the staff informed me to get bottle opener from lobby bar!!! The extra miles service were not here....... Oh they only clear up tables, don't wipe the tables..... 6. The uniform and the overall appearance and grooming of the staff, the product knowledge, the quaility of service..... I dunno..... Has Accor been downgraded that far? Ah many staff in visible service area were so attached to their handphone...."

"857.","Deddy Misli","1","2022-01-22","3","Cukup bagus suasananya, tapi untuk lahan parkir sangat terbatas, sampai saya parkir di tempat yg dilarang, yg berakibat motor saya digembok oleh pihak sekuriti hotel. Untuk pelayanan selama event PT AJTM, di ruang batur dan kerinci, pelayanan dari waiter Mas Bagus Dwi, sangat excellent."
"858.","sari maulani","254","2024-01-22","3","Hari ini pertama kali ke hotel ini lg. Mau parkir motor disuruh ke kiri setelah KFC, nanya apa ada sign nya ke satpam ktnya ada, udh tengak tengok ga ada sign, kecuali pas di hotelnya. Pas masuk disuruh cek in peduli lindungi, kok jadul yaa.. Di mall yg udh rame aja gak pake peduli lindungi lg. Truuss.. Kan meeting di lantai 16, begitu keluar lift bau karpet basah yg gak bikin nyaman. Hmmmm first impression yang gak okee.."

"866.","Gregory Seman Son","82","2022-01-22","3","This hotel is the quarantine hotel. The staff is waiting for the guests at the airport in Jakarta. The hotel provides with PCR test as soon as the guest arrives. However, the test result is very strange. I got the negative result from the PCR test in Korea in the day before I arrive at the hotel but I got the positive on the 3rd day after I arrived. I got 2 negative results after moving to another hotel for the isolation in Jakarta. My test results were negative-positive-negative-negative-negative during 16 days and I got the negative result after returning to Korea. The hotel replied me the medical part is not on its business, but the test personnel belongs to the hotel. If you choose this hotel, you may stay at another hotel for the isolation for over 14 days without going out from the hotel. I don't recommend this hotel."

"903.","Christelle Monory","42","2025-09-22","3","Hotel kelas menengah, yang mungkin perlu direnovasi karena pancuran dan wastafel kamar mandinya banyak jamur. Kekurangan utamanya adalah bau tembakau yang menyengat di koridor dan kamar, meskipun hotel ini bebas rokok."
"904.","Jean Neil","289","2025-08-22","3","Lokasinya sentral, tetapi agak terpencil dan tidak mudah diakses dengan mobil. Seperti yang diharapkan dari sebuah hotel milik Grup Accord Prancis, kamar-kamarnya kecil, tetapi bersih dan nyaman dengan AC yang kuat. Namun, kebersihannya agak kurang. Meskipun harganya lumayan, area sekitarnya agak kurang nyaman karena terbatasnya jumlah restoran dan tidak adanya supermarket."
"905.","이민규","37","2025-08-22","3","Kamarnya nyaman, stasiun kereta bawah tanahnya dekat, dan lokasinya strategis untuk jalan-jalan! Sayangnya, kolam renangnya agak kecil. Saya juga memesan tempat tidur king, tapi mereka menyatukan dua kasur single, yang agak aneh."
"906.","J. Jäger","73","2025-01-22","3","Kamarnya cukup luas, dilengkapi brankas, kulkas, dan bahkan setrika. Tersedia port USB, jadi tidak perlu adaptor. Sayangnya, jarak antara tempat tidur dan sofa sangat sempit. Kamarnya berkarpet. Satu lagi yang disayangkan: sejak malam kedua, kipas kamar mandi berbau asap rokok. Ada juga jamur di nat di sekitar wastafel. Sayangnya, Wi-Fi-nya kurang bagus. Pilihan sarapannya lumayan. Sarapannya kebanyakan Asia. Restorannya cukup terjangkau, tetapi rasa makanannya agak berbeda. Selain itu, kentang gorengnya kurang matang di malam kedua. Seharusnya dimasak tiga menit lebih lama. Stafnya sangat ramah dan fasih berbahasa Inggris. Sebuah supermarket berjarak sekitar 150 meter dari hotel."
"907.","Daniela Fernandez","21","2024-01-22","3","Kami menginap semalam saat Tahun Baru. Pelayanan dan fasilitasnya sungguh sempurna, tetapi kekurangannya, dan yang paling negatif, adalah mereka memberi kami kamar merokok (padahal kami meminta kamar bebas rokok). Bau rokok tercium di lorong-lorong, dan kamarnya begitu menyengat sehingga semua pakaian kami berbau rokok. Sepertinya mereka tidak pernah mengangin-anginkan kamar. Hal ini membuat hotel tidak nyaman bagi kami, tetapi kami sangat lelah dengan jet lag sehingga kami tidak mengeluh. Ini perlu diingat jika Anda bukan perokok."
"908.","Alwin Köpke","39","2024-01-22","3","Ulasan ini berdasarkan pengalaman menginap beberapa hari di kamar deluxe. Semuanya bersih dan rapi, menurut keterangan staf kebersihan. Pemandangan dari jendela kamar juga bagus. AC agak tidak nyaman, karena diarahkan langsung ke tempat tidur. Bahkan pada pengaturan terendah, tetap ada hembusan angin dingin yang konstan. Mematikannya sepenuhnya juga bukan pilihan, karena ruangan cepat menjadi pengap. Kami berdua sedikit terserang flu menjelang akhir masa menginap kami. Saya tidak tahu apakah ekspektasi saya sebagai orang Barat terhadap kamar mandi terlalu tinggi, tetapi saya merasa terganggu karena terkadang kotoran (asing?) terbuang ke dalam air toilet melalui pipa. Jadi, jika Anda menyiram toilet tadi malam dan semuanya tampak bersih, Anda mungkin menemukan kotoran di toilet keesokan harinya. Sayangnya, sangat menjengkelkan bahwa slot kartu kunci atau pasokan listrik mengalami kerusakan selama beberapa hari terakhir. Akibatnya, listrik di kamar terus padam secara acak (lihat video). Karena kami sering bepergian dan kejadian itu baru terjadi beberapa hari terakhir, saya tidak mengeluh tentang masalah tersebut. Sarapan: Pilihan di restoran cukup baik jika Anda menyukai makanan Indonesia. Tersedia juga beberapa pilihan hidangan Barat. Fasilitas Tambahan: Para tamu memiliki akses ke kolam renang yang terawat dengan baik, dari mana mereka juga dapat menikmati pemandangan matahari terbenam yang indah. Tersedia juga pusat kebugaran yang sangat bersih dan dilengkapi dengan semua peralatan dasar. Staf: Semua staf sangat ramah dan membantu. Beberapa staf tidak selalu terlalu perhatian, dan ada beberapa karyawan yang tidak fasih berbahasa Inggris. Hal ini terkadang membuat komunikasi sedikit sulit."
"909.","Roland Pospischil-Schwartz","58","2023-01-22","3","Mengingat kota dan sungainya, Novotel adalah tempat menginap yang layak, dan semua orang sangat ramah. Namun, untuk sebuah Novotel, ada beberapa hal yang kurang memenuhi standar. Seprai dibersihkan tetapi bernoda, dan karpet disedot debu tetapi jelas terlihat usang. Di kamar mandi/toilet, kami menemukan beberapa jepit rambut dan rambut dari tamu sebelumnya, serta banyak noda hitam di kamar mandi. Pintu tidak tertutup rapat, dan brankas di kamar rusak. Seluruh hotel sangat tua dan jelas membutuhkan renovasi. Sarapan prasmanan sangat bervariasi dan baru disiapkan, dan setidaknya mereka berusaha menanggapi keluhan kami. Pusat kebugaran telah direnovasi sepenuhnya dan sangat layak pakai, sementara kolam renang agak kurang menarik, meskipun kabut asap membuat sinar matahari tidak pernah masuk."
"910.","mac box","53","2024-01-22","3","Lokasi, ukuran, dan kamar secara keseluruhan bagus. Harganya relatif tinggi. Kolam renang dan sarapan di bawah rata-rata. Kebersihan kamar dan handuk terus terang sangat buruk. Mereka yang memiliki kulit sensitif sebaiknya tidak menginap di hotel ini."
"911.","Abdulmalik Sulaiman .","25","2024-01-22","3","Kamarnya bagus, tapi kamar mandinya kurang bagus, dan koridor kamarnya bau banget, entah karena parfum atau apa, dan internet di kamarnya berantakan, sering putus-nyambung 💔"
