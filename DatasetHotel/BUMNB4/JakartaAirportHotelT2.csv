"1.","john “Florida MC5”","23","2025-12-24","5","I flew in to terminal three and I’m flying out of terminal three. But I landed at 10:30 AM. None of the two hotels at terminal three take day rooms. I got on the train that goes between the terminals. It took about 10 minutes to wait for the train and the train itself took about 10 minutes. Then as soon as you go into terminal two, there is the hotel! You have to walk up some stairs, but they have a porter to take your luggage up for you. Had a great stay for the day. Plus, we ate at their restaurant which is right up with the rooms and it was fantastic. 17 USD for two people for full lunch. Delicious."
"2.","Santi KD","20","2025-12-10","5","Located conveniently on the second floor of Terminal 2E. From my room, i could watch planes take off and land. The room service food was quite good. Overall, it is a clean & comfortable"
"3.","Darryl Chew","238","2025-12-01","3","A suitable spot for an overnight if you have a connecting flight to catch. Rooms are clean and easy to get to. They have also a storage area where you can leave luggage you do not need to use during your stay."
"4.","Billy Jah","394","2025-12-10","5","Hotel ini menawarkan kamar yang bersih dan nyaman dengan fasilitas lengkap. Suasananya tenang, staf ramah, dan area lobi tertata rapi. Lokasinya sangat dekat bandara, memudahkan akses bagi tamu transit atau perjalanan bisnis, sehingga pengalaman menginap terasa praktis dan menyenangkan."
"5.","Dessy Diana","17","2025-12-01","5","It's a great place to stay during your flight transit. They have just everything you need, convey capsul with all equipments, locker, and shower. I had a really pleasant stay. Very recommended"
"6.","Ira Alamsyah","12","2025-08-31","3","If you’ve got a crack‑of‑dawn flight and don’t fancy a morning marathon through the airport, this place is your lifesaver. We booked it for one night before our umrah flight through the hajj terminal, and staying right in Terminal 2D was a total game‑changer—just a short stroll to check‑in. The room? Nothing fancy. The decor is dated, but the bed’s comfy and everything was clean. The real treat was the window facing the runway—grown‑ups will feel like kids again watching the planes roll by. Breakfast kicks off at 3 AM and has more variety than you’d expect. I stuck to tea, but my family seemed to enjoy the spread. Yes, it’s a bit pricey, but you’re paying for unbeatable location and zero morning stress. For my next super‑early flight, I’d book here again without thinking twice."
"7.","Retno Trimbos","68","2025-07-31","5","Layanan ramah dan cepat. Lokasi strategis bila hendak terbang dgn Batik Air (terminal 2). Sarapan dari jam 3-9. Fasilitas di kamar lengkap (sabun, sikat gigi, pemasak air, tidak ada hair dryer). Kamar bersih dan pemandangan bagus (lapangan udara)."
"8.","Chester","1","2025-10-01","5","Okie was outstanding—always welcoming, attentive, and ready to help with a smile. His professionalism and genuine care made my stay comfortable and memorable. He truly goes above and beyond to ensure guests feel valued."
"9.","E Durman","437","2025-07-31","5","Booked this hotel previously for my daughter due to its convenience being within T2 of CGK airport. This time I booked for myself. I doubted at the beginning as it is an old hotel. But I must admit that it is so convenient and clean. The corridor does look a bit dated. If you arrive at T3, there's a free shuttle train service, and bus (airport operated one) to take you to T2. Perfect if your next flight is a domestic one. You only need to walk about 5 minutes without leaving the building. Breakfast is served from 3am for those travellers with early flights; very considerate. It is quiet, didn't hear planes taking off or landing. Plenty of places to eat of course or you can eat at their restaurant. It's clean and spacious. A swimming pool would have been a bonus!"
"10.","Alberto Bet","8","2025-08-31","5","We’re very grateful to Riki from Jakarta Airport Hotel for his outstanding help. He went out of his way to assist us in purchasing an accessory we needed, and was extremely kind, attentive, and helpful throughout. His support made a real difference during our stay. Thank you, Riki!"

"21.","albert.p","216","2025-05-31","4","Menginap awal mei 2025. Pintu masuk dekat pintu 2F. Dekat juga dengan kalayang. Kamar bersih meski hotel tua. Air panas ada, tekanan besar. Bagusnya view langsung landasan pesawat. Yang perlu perbaikan kualitas breakfast karena sederhana dan tidak ada egg station. Kopi diseduh manual tidak ada mesin kopi"

"23.","Tariq Khan","244","2025-07-01","4","There are no rooms at this airport which I used so cannot comment. But the staff I dealt with and people I spoke to were very friendly and helpful. It's a very nice airport and very big. Lots of places to eat and sit."
"24.","Nicky Jurd","681","2025-01-31","5","We had an excellent stay here which we chose because of a very early morning connection. The beds are firm and comfortable, the rooms are spacious by comparison to other hotels I’ve stayed in and everything was very clean. Amazingly breakfast starts at 3am, and the selection was excellent! We have booked this hotel again in a few days when we have another early connection. Also worth noting the staff are very friendly and accommodating!"
"25.","Selfi Irawan","4","2025-05-01","5","spent a night here before my next flight and it’s really worth it! nice view, breakfast starts at 3am, friendly and helpful staff, and i love that they really provide a great service including for those who needs wheelchair support. highly recommend this place for transit flight passengers!"
"26.","Taslimah Taslimah","1","2025-05-01","5","Walaupun sedikit redup penerangan ruangan tapi lumayan bersih, air hangat ok, room service yang pertama ok yang kedua kalj pesan chamomile tea tidak dikasih gelas dan pengaduknya, mungkin karena order pas midnight 😀, untuk soto ayam kalau bisa disedikan kacap manisnya agar lebih mantab rasanya. Hotel ini nyaman sekali, pelayanan ramah, lelah setelah 33 jam penerbangan hilang. Lokasi strategis di terminal 2e dekat untuk koneksi penerbangan domestik dan breakfastnya bisa pagi sekali cocok untuk yang punya penerbangan pagi seperti saya jam 6 pagi. Awesome job jakarta airport hotel!!"
"27.","Heru Triyana","15","2025-07-31","5","Great nice for flight transit, worth of spent, love the plane view ...my 3,5 year old boy keep screaming any time plane take off, nice experience for kid"
"28.","Selma Aulina","21","2025-03-03","1","Oh well, we arrived in Jakarta late and this hotel location is super close to our arrival gate. - They have a lot of stairs, so if you have many big luggage, avoid this hotel. - The room smells moldy. - No hot water. We showered with cold water at night. - I asked for a hairdryer and they said they’ll send it. I waited for long time, so I called then again and they said “oh we don’t have it anymore”. Dude! The service is really really bad. Just avoid this hotel."

"33.","Naura Naufal","260","2025-10-01","4","Kamar tidur yang nyaman dan bersih Layanan memuaskan Lokasi strategis di pusat kota"
"34.","R M","61","2025-05-01","5","Kurang nya hanya dapat kamar nya agak jauh. Mungkin next time aku harus request yang agak dekat dengan loby karena kondisi ku yang keterbatasan gerak (disabilitas). Untuk disabilitas yang harus menggunakan kursi roda, butuh bantuan karena serba tangga. Untuk suasana sangat nyaman, petugas nya juga ramah dan baik. Makanan nya enak enak meskipun agak asin sedikit di aku but overall 👌. Cocok yang transit atau sekedar nginap aja. Bagi kamu yang menggunakan Skytrain, dari turun tangga masuk pintu terus ke kiri. Hotel nya tepat dikanan."
"35.","Ing Mei","98","2025-03-03","5","This is a good 3 stars hotel inside the airport for able-bodied person. They don't have a lift or elevator to the room, and your journey started with a set of stairs to the elevator. A friendly staff will be more than happy to help you carry your suitcases and belongings to your room, provided they aren't helping otherspassanger to the shuttles. Or, during peak hours, check in when everybody tried to climb the stairs with their luggage at the same time. The room is clean and spacious. Check-in and out were quick and hassle free. They provided free shuttles to T1 and T3 every hour. Breakfast is included, and the chef did a good job with food selection on the day I was there. I didn't take the picture of the hot food selection. Bubur ayam and fried rice are highly recommended. Warning, no wheelchair access. If you are unable to climb the stairs, please give yourself a favour, book elsewhere."

"39.","YinTeng Chew","2","2025-05-31","5","Jakarta CGK airport is very advanced in immigration clearance in comparison to other neighboring countries. Stronger wifi than the airport one can be obtained to speed up clearance. Luggage collection area is beautiful with nature-like design, bringing some peace to baggage waiting area. Officers are always there to help."

"41.","jenny vanesa quintero moreno","12","2025-07-01","1","the immigration service is the worst I have ever dealt with in my life, they do not collaborate, they spend their time eating in your face as if they did not have a space and time for their break, they make fun of your misfortune since I had to pay a fine, I saw them with a mocking face and celebrating that I had to pay them millions just because of their own negligence, it is an underdeveloped country with so much technology and others, you make it difficult to take advantage of tourists, it is a place that I do not recommend and I hope I never have to return to, a girl who was in the same situation as me and with the lack of resources missed her flight and could not take another one until the following Monday being Friday night and knowing that that was not the place where she began her trip, truly unconscious people"
"42.","CJ","7","2025-03-31","3","Wlpn saya pesan sarapan American pas check-in, ternyata saat check out. Tidak ada. Mba yg bertugas d depan mngkn lupa pesanin. Ternyata, wlpn termaduk d harga, tdk ada jamin bisa bnr2 dapat. Saya sangat kecewa dengan Jamarta Airport Hotel. Dulu sy stay d situ 2/3 setahun, tetapi sy akan nyari opsi lain."
"43.","Antonio Benasaglio","12","2025-05-31","4","The hotel is nice but it does NOT have a pool. I’d encourage the hotel staff to remove that picture which is misleading. It is convenient it you have to catch a flight from Jakarta Airport."
"44.","zulfiarrahman","61","2024-12-31","5","Jakarta airport hotel Ada di terminal 2F bandara soeta Baru pertama kali saya dan istri mencoba menginap di jakarta airport hotel, karena sampai di jakarta sore dan besok paginya terbang lagi, Gak expect ternyata bagus sekali kalau dibandingkan hotel hotel di bandara lainnya, Kamarnya bersih, kamar mandi bersih, setelan air panas nya juga lancar, lengkap dengan hairdryer. staf sigap membantu membawakan barang dan ramah. Breakfast dibuka mulai jam 03.00 pagi 👍"
"45.","Rob 1","40","2025-01-31","4","Our second stay here. Location works well for us - flying internationally then internal flight. Same on way back. Free shuttle bus also works well. Reception staff and porters great. There is no lift from the ground floor. Escalators take you to reception. Rooms more than adequate and clean/comfy for the price. The only thing that doesn’t work for us is the breakfast. This mornings experience was pretty poor. We laughed about it but there were no coffee cups, cutlery forks and when I eventually got a cup (espresso size) the coffee looked and tasted like it had only looked at some coffee grounds. Milk for cereal was warm. Asked for cold milk and was told there was none. Then 5 minutes later the milk was replenished with cold milk! This should be on ice. Block of melting butter sits on a plastic dish (no ice) that looks terrible when a couple of people have had a stab at it. In some circumstances I do believe pre packaged butter and jams is required to provide a good food hygiene environment. This is a great place to stay but please do review your breakfast service. We walked into the terminal downstairs and ate at one of the dozens of food outlets there."
"46.","N.R.H","87","2024-12-31","5","Sedang transit dan cari hotel terdekat di terminal 2? Jakarta Airport hotel ini pilihannya. Lokasinya ada di Terminal 2E Bandara Soekarno Hatta, mau ke kalayang untuk pindah terminal juga mudah, tinggal keluar hotel ke kiri, lanjut ke kanan naik eskalator. Kamarnya luas dan tempatnya nyaman, staffnya sangat helpfull dan ramah Sarapan mulai dari jam 03.00 WIB sampai 10.00 WIB Bisa request sarapan dibungkus untuk di bawa di pesawat."

Kamarnya viewnya juga keren langsung bisa lihat pesawat2 yang take off dan landing . Tersedia restaurant juga . Pokoknya nggak nyesel daripada nunggu jadwal penerbangan berjam jam di bandara mending tunggu di hotel ini sambil tiduran. Keberadaan hotel ini Cukup membantu musafir macam saya ."
"50.","Muhammad Zahid","45","2025-03-31","5","Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (CGK) - Busy Yet Efficient Airport Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (CGK) is the main airport serving Jakarta and one of the busiest airports in Southeast Asia. Despite its high traffic, the airport manages to provide a smooth and efficient experience for travelers. The terminals are spacious, clean, and equipped with modern facilities, making it a comfortable place to navigate. The airport offers various amenities, including duty-free shops, restaurants, lounges, and prayer rooms. The food options are diverse, featuring both local Indonesian dishes and international cuisine. The signage is clear, and the staff are friendly and helpful, especially when providing guidance to foreign visitors. Transportation to and from the airport is convenient, with various options such as taxis, buses, and the Airport Rail Link. While traffic congestion can be an issue on the road, the train service provides a reliable and fast alternative for reaching the city center. The only downside is that the airport can get crowded during peak hours, but the well-organized layout helps in managing the flow of passengers effectively. Overall, Soekarno-Hatta International Airport is a well-managed facility that provides a positive travel experience for both domestic and international travelers."

"53.","Wes","18","2024-12-31","5","Excellent service. It's right in the airport so was perfect for our next day flight. Great buffet breakfast. The receptionist printed off our boarding passes. Our picture window looked over the runway, but it was quiet. Free shuttle to our terminal. The hall rugs were faded, but other than that, it was a great stay."
"54.","Bambang Sugiyanto","46","2025-12-01","5","Tempat strategis karena ada di seputaran bandara soeta"
"55.","Zaki Rahman","123","2025-01-31","5","Kapan lagi sarapan sambil lihat pesawat landing atau depart. Lokasi di Terminal 2 Soeta, di atas 2E, dekat dengan skytrain Terminal 2. Cocok buat yang ingin istirahat semalam sebelum melanjutkan penerbangan ke luar maupun kembali ke dalam"
"56.","Lester","70","2025-10-31","5","Nice and relaxing ambiance. Love the garden like theme."
"57.","Danijel Bubanovic","40","2024-12-31","5","Very practical and affordable hotel! For a very low price, you get a lot: Despite being right at the airport, the hotel is extremely quiet; no airplane noise whatsoever. The hotel restaurant serves huge portions of food, pleasantly surprising and more than enough, especially if you're hungry. The staff is very professional, courteous, and accommodating. The hotel is clean. The hotel provides a free taxi to your terminal (if you're traveling outside the sky train operating hours)."
"58.","Chef Benz","1","2025-05-31","1","When we check out we have to go to terminal 1,the concierge told me no free shuttle bus because of group booking.so the put us in private car and we have to pay Rp 350 000. After we arrive at terminal 1 I saw a few free shuttle bus arriving and almost empty, we feel cheated"
"59.","Heidi Fisher","78","2024-12-31","3","If you have to spend the night in Jakarta, this is a very convenient place to stay. Room was pretty clean but although we were no-smoking side, you could still smell smoke. You can also hear the flight announcements all night. We were only there 7 hrs between flights and that was enough. Glad to have a place to sleep but it was the worst place we stayed in our couple weeks traveling. And they really need to invest in new towels."
"60.","Luki E H","125","2024-12-31","5","Overall good, the service to check in and transfer to the airport is really helpful. They offer a shuttle car from the hotel to T3, and helped me alot with my luggage. Got a lot of steps in the entrance but the hotel guy will help you. Nice breakfast and it was served starting at 3am, good for those with early flight. The room window will give you flying airplane view."

"64.","Wiley Spears","11","2024-12-31","5","Stayed here twice during my travels across Indonesia. Very convenient shuttle that meets you upon arrival and runs every hour 24/7 for your return to the terminal. Easy to coordinate with the driver via WhatsApp and they are waiting for you with a sign upon exiting the arrival hall. The hotel’s location is also right next to the Sky Train, which is very convenient and runs every 5 or so minutes during the day. Shoutout to Han for his fantastic service when he picked us up. Food is pretty good, rooms are clean, A/C blows cold, and shower was very hot with excellent pressure. Highly recommend to anyone who needs a bed while they pass through Soekarno-Hatta airport."
"65.","Marcin Stepien","171","2025-07-31","5","Great option to wait for next flight when your waiting time for flight is long or you have change of flights as we had."
"66.","Nadia Putri","20","2024-12-31","5","Hotel yang menarik ada didalam Bandara. Kamarnya nyaman, luas dan bersih. Apalagi dengan view landasan membuat anak2 sangat senang. Hotel transit yang sangat cocok untuk dikunjungi, makanannya juga enak lho 😍"
"67.","Michael D.","195","2024-12-31","3","This place is recommendable. The hotel does not have an elevator. You can easily reach the terminals or the train from the hotel. The rooms are simple. The air is stale. The windows cannot be opened for security reasons. Breakfast could not be offered to me. Although I booked and paid for the room for one day!"
"68.","L T","255","2024-12-31","3","Location - conveniently located within terminal 2 and connected by shuttle train service between the terminals. However, the access is via a flight of stairs followed by escalator. If you have heavy luggages, this can be challenging. Although there’s some sort of conveyor belt to bring the luggage up but it was not operational when we got there and there was no porter in sight too to help. Service - friendly service in general. The breakfast starts at 3 am which is amazing for early flights. Food is average. A huge plus is the airport shuttle service to other terminals. Just book and enquire at reception. Rooms - dated furnishings. Worst of all, there was a blood stain on the duvet cover. This is still unacceptable even if it is a clean sheet with stain that cannot be removed. Further, repair work was ongoing even at 11 pm. The drilling and hammering noise was almost unbearable. Although we were so closely located next to the runway (as seen in the photo taken from the hotel room), there was no disturbance from the planes."
"69.","Devi Sagita Ratri","8","2024-12-31","1","Saat saya memesan dari aplikasi Agoda yang mana seharusnya hal ini adalah kerjasama dengan pihak hotel Jakarta Airport Hotel, saya merasa dibohongi karena seharusnya pembayaran adalah hal yg seharusnya paling DIMUDAHKAN pihak HOTEL. Saya ingin segera membayar, dan mendapatkan bukti bayar namun di AGODA pihak HOTEL hanya memberikan opsi debit/credit, pembayaran lewat debit tidak langsung bisa ditarik oleh pihak hotel, namun harus bayar langsung di hotel sementara saya memesankan untuk client, (masa client harus bayarin hotel dulu di tempat kalo misal ada masalah dengan pembayaran debit) terkadang pembayaran melalui debit beberapa kali tertolak walaupun saat itu saldo debit tersedia beberapa kali lipat dari yg seharusnya dibutuhkan, bahkan ketika saya berusaha menelpon pihak hotel, hotel terus berkelit dengan mengatakan bahwa pembayaran harus dilakukan di hotel dan itu adalah SOP. SOP mana yang malah menyulitkan customer membayar, hal ini sangat menghambat saya untuk melakukan administrasi kantor. Hotel tidak mau memberikan kemudahan dan tidak memberikan opsi penyelesaian masalah selain dengan yang mereka berikan (Pembayaran ditarik saat hari H customer datang). Selain tanpa solusi pihak HOTEL tidak memiliki komunikasi yang baik karena tidak bisa menjelaskan dasar keputusan dari ketidak mampuannya menarik pembiayaan segera, ditambah dengan sikap yang AROGAN. Minus banget, tanpa penyelesaian. Pengalaman pertama dan terkahir saya disini. Saya yakin banyak hotel yang Jauh lebih baik namun lebih Affordable dari Jakarta Airport Hotel. Kalau ditanya KENAPA TIDAK DIBATALKAN SAJA? KARENA PIHAK HOTEL TIDAK MENYEDIAKAN KEBIJAKAN UNTUK CANCEL BAIK DARI HOTEL NYA ATAU DARI APLIKASI, KARENA TIDAK AKAN DI REFUND WALAUPUN SAYA PESAN MASIH ADA 8 HARI (11 NOVEMBER 2024) SEBELUM AKHIRNYA MENGINAP DI TANGGAL 19 NOVEMBER 2024. APAKAH TIDAK ADA KETERANGAN DARI AWAL BAYAR DI HOTEL? TIDAK ADA. SILAHKAN LIHAT DI GAMBAR JADI BENAR2 TIDAK ADA PENYELESAIAN YANG WIN WIN SOLUTION. Makasih buat mas2 yang ga bisa ngasih solusi via telpon kantor hotel tanggal 11 November 2024 jam 15.46, BAD ATTITUDE."

"71.","Giyarti Arti","7","2024-12-31","5","Hotel yang sangat strategis untuk transit... kami menginap apabila ada lanjutan penerbangan internasional atau selepas kedatangan internasional. Saya tidak pedulikan lemari atau kulkas atau dengan lainnya karena hotel ini memang hotel yang berdiri lumayan lama dari hotel hotel baru disekitaran airport. Saya hanya perlu bantalnya yang tinggi tapi sangat empuk terasa sangat NYAMAN setelah berjam jam penerbangan. Terima kasih Jakarta Airport Hotel🙏🙏"
"72.","Reta Yudistyana","55","2024-12-31","5","Hotel favorit baru kalau lagi travelling bareng anak-anak. Lokasinya ada di dalam terminal 2, jadi jangan heran kalau maps mungkin akan mengarahkan kita turun di depan pintu masuk terminal. Kamarnya cukup luas, viewnya langsung ke runway. Melihat pesawat lepas landas atau mendarat bisa menjadi atraksi sendiri yang bisa dinikmati di hotel ini. Karena tujuan nginepnya untuk mengejar pesawat pagi, sarapannya selalu minta take away. Ada dua pilihan set menu, American atau Indonesian breakfast. Keduanya sama enaknya, porsinya pas dan bumbunya berasa."

"75.","Amy Toi","36","2023-12-31","3","Stayed at the Jakarta Airport Hotel for one night before catching an early morning flight the following day. While the hotel is quite basic and in need of some renovations, the staff's friendliness and helpfulness made the stay bearable. The rooms themselves are a bit dated, with outdated furniture and a lack of modern amenities like hairdryers or irons. The safe in my room was also broken, and the toilet flush was quite weak. Additionally, the pillowcase on my bed had a noticeable stain. Upon requesting a replacement, the housekeeper who was cleaning the next room promptly provided me with a fresh pillowcase. Despite the hotel's shortcomings, I must commend the staff for their genuine hospitality and willingness to assist guests. The concierge was particularly helpful in providing information and addressing my requests. The hotel offers a complimentary breakfast, which was simple but adequate. It consisted of basic staples like bread, cereal, and eggs and traditional Indonesian morning porridge. Overall, the Jakarta Airport Hotel is a decent option for those seeking a convenient and affordable place to stay near the airport."
"76.","Kitty Lakatos","29","2023-12-31","3","Pros: - Very friendly and polite staff. - The room is clean, the bed is comfy. - The view is awesome! - The breakfast selection is limited, but the food is tasty. Cons: - It is very annoying to carry the bags on the stairs - The edge of the towel frays - The fridge needs maintenance, because is not working properly"

"78.","Bintang Meilita P","9","2024-12-31","5","Lokasinya di terminal 2e. Cocok untuk yg ingin transit atau ada penerbangan pagi2 sekali. Kamarnya bersih, staffnya ramah dan sangat membantu.

"79.","Reza Femi Depta Fandari","26","2023-12-31","4","I stayed for one night at this airport hotel. The hotel was easy to locate, which was a relief. The room itself was quite spacious and had an old, but decent interior. The view from the room was also quite good, adding to the overall experience. However, I did notice that the corridor was quite long and dark, which could be improved to enhance the overall ambiance. Despite this minor drawback, my stay was pleasant, and I appreciated the spaciousness and decent interior of the room."

"82.","Andy Mengz","183","2023-12-31","4","Lokasinya sangat strategis di terminal 2e dan 2f bandara. Kamarnya banyak ada sekitar 80 kamar, memanjang hanya 1 lantai. Kamarnya kamar tua tapi masih lumayan bagus. Pelayanan juga bagus, hanya saja telepon untuk room service rusak tapi untung bisa telopon liat nomornya di google, buat minta hairdryer. Sarapan lumayan enak, tapi variasinya standar. Oiya bisa shuttle juga ke ke terminal lainya. Oke no komplain sih."
"83.","Muhammad Muqsith","129","2024-12-31","4","Perfect for those in transit, waiting for next flight but does not intend to go anywhere outside the airport area. Exiting the hotel brings you very close to the departure hall of Terminal 2, and right in front of Shuttle train station. This hotel fulfills basic needs and amenities, so you cannot expect much. Breakfast is between 0300 to 0900 local time. Window view is interesting. Your kids will love to watch airplanes going by on the tarmac and runway, viewing right from the comfort of your noiseproof room. One thing about the access though, it is only by a pair of escalators and sone stairs, so wheelchair access is absent."

"85.","Putu Aditya Perdana Giri","211","2024-12-31","4","It's good if you need to transit overnight. Pretty convenience location right in front of skytrain platform at the international departure of Soekarno-Hatta International Airport Terminal 2E. As the location is at the departure hall, you also can get easily to any shop at the terminal. If you need to go to other terminal, you can take skytrain right in front of you or take a shuttle bus. The room is not luxury but clean, comfortable, and quiet. Not for long vacation but if it's just short stay, it's more than enough. Extra perk. You can directly see the apron and taxiway from your room window."
"86.","Dee","733","2025-03-03","5","Berlokasi di dalam terminal 2D - 2E, hotel ini menjadi pilihan bagi penumpang yg butuh hotel untk melanjutkan perjalanan dg pesawat di bandara Soekarno Hatta. Hotelnya ga luas, sepanjang lorong terdiri dari banyak kamar yg menghadap bandara. Kamarnya standart, tidak luas tapi bersih dan cukup lengkap fasilitasnya. Breakfastnya ada beberapa pilihan dg rasa yg lumayan enak. Staffnya ramah dan membantu para customer yg ingin nginap di hotel tersebut. Sayangnya ketika membayar, saya minta struk pembayaran, tidak diberikan oleh resepsionist, nanti saja ketika check out diberikannya, ujar receptionist tsb. Ternyata ketika saya check out, struk pembayaran / bill tidak diberikan oleh receptionist."
"87.","Madison P","219","2023-12-31","4","We were there for only a few short hours overnight between flights but it was a good experience. They also accommodated us at the last minute which was a life saver! The front desk staff were very quick and helpful, and the free shuttle service to a different terminal was great. They also nicely provided a breakfast box for our early flight. However, it’s a good thing we were there for such a short time because the bathroom was leaking everywhere. Not only from the caulking on the toilet but also the shower. On top of that, the drain in the shower seemed super clogged and the rooms themselves were clearly built/furnished a long time ago."
"88.","Josh Hixson","50","2024-12-31","2","Old, run down hotel. Shower clogged and curtain ripped, but most importantly it’s in the wrong terminal, so if your flight is early the tram is closed and shuttle is only on the hour. We found ourselves trying to negotiate a 300,000 rupee taxi for only 10 mins of travel time!"

Inside the airport, in terminal 2 which is between terminal 1 and 3, and exactly in-front of the skytrain gate. They also have very convenient free shuttle between terminals. The staffs are nice, and the breakfast also delicious Indonesian foods. The room is enough for two adult, not that spacious but has very beautiful view. The cons is the hotel furniture is little bit old, also when first time enter the room, it has mold smell. If only they can improve this, for sure we are willing to pay more."

The AC dripped water on the floor, the doors on the closet were almost falling off, there were cracks etc in the walls, closet doors were almost falling off and would not shut completely leaving a light on that i couldn't turn off. And worst of all the shower would not drain. I complained and the staff came in to fix it and found a hug and super disgusting clump of hair and i dont know what else clogging the drain. I was completely grossed out. However, once they put me in a different room, everything was fine. The room was in decent repair and everything worked. Restaurant is fine and location is good for long layovers. Just be sure to fully check out your room before trying to settle in or relax. Evidently they have some that are much better than others."
"98.","Waqar Ali Gill","146","2024-12-31","3","Very confused location its on terminal 2 gate 4 and all the international flights landed on terminal 1. From T1 to T2 you need a taxi who will charge you between 10 to 20$ and 20 minutes. Becareful drivers are also not good and very tricky. Hotel is old and small. Rooms are also very small i think the photos here are old."
"99.","Padraig Seif","331","2022-12-31","5","As airport hotels go, they're usually expensive and not particularly good. You pay for the convenience. Well, this hotel may be an exception. Reasonably priced, located directly between Terminal 2D and 2E on the second floor, they have revamped the lobby area and bar/cafe. The rooms are nothing to write home about, but they're clean and the bathrooms are large. The bed is fine. The view is fantastic if you are interested in planes: you overlook the runway and apron of Terminal 2. Staff is friendly and speaks great English. Prices are reasonable. And the room service food was tasty and cheap. The inroom massage was not the best I've ever had, but for a layover hotel actually not bad."
"100.","Muhammad A","88","2023-12-31","4","Kamar dan pelayanan bagus sekali. Rekom buat para traveller utk menginap disini jika transit. Sudah dilengkapi pengantaran gratis ke bandara.

"101.","Master of Asia","543","2023-12-31","5","Hotel is located terminal 2. My first impression is so many stairs lol. Even though this hotel is indicated transit hotel on the signboard in the airport but first impression is stairs when you arrive here.But you don’t worry about that, there is a porter and he could help you to bring your luggage to your room. They will help you when checkout as well. Staffs are kindly and Room is also clean, we can see airport from room or cockpit restaurant. Restaurant has beer. Totally here is good hotel I think."

"107.","Sergejs Ponomarjovs","64","2024-12-31","5","An Unforgettable Night at Jakarta’s Most Conveniently Located Time Capsule: Jakarta Airport Hotel 🏨 😀 ✈️✈️✈️ Imagine being so close to your next flight you could practically board in your pajamas. Welcome to Jakarta Airport Hotel, the only place where “catching a flight” might mean literally jogging from your room to the gate. This isn’t just a hotel; it’s a limbo between time zones, a haven for the perpetually jet-lagged, and a masterclass in airport convenience. The location is so good, it’s almost comical. Nestled in the heart of Terminal 2E, it’s like sleeping in the belly of the airport beast without the inconvenience of actually having to sleep on the floor. Forget about shuttle buses or waking up 4 hours before your flight; here, you can roll out of bed and into security check in less time than it takes to say “overslept.” Service and staff? Picture this: a group of the friendliest people you’ve never met, treating you like the long-lost relative who’s just returned from an exotic adventure. Their warmth is so genuine, you might start to wonder if you accidentally stumbled into a family gathering rather than a hotel lobby. Ah, but let’s not forget the exclusive VIP treatment: the extra security. Nothing says “welcome” like having your bags X-rayed and walking through a metal detector. It’s like they’re saying, “We’re so glad you’re here, now prove you’re not a spy.” It adds a layer of excitement to your stay - a little taste of espionage fiction before bedtime. Breakfast from 3 AM to 9 AM is a concept so revolutionary, it challenges the very fabric of time. It’s perfect for those who’ve convinced themselves that jet lag is just a state of mind. The range of hours is so accommodating, you could have a meal in two different time zones and still have time to spare. The rooms are a treasure trove of essentials – free water, because you might have forgotten what hydration feels like; toothbrush and toothpaste, for when your luggage is on a different continent; and the elusive “etcetera,” a mystery assortment that keeps you guessing. The windows offer a silent movie of planes taking off, a serene experience disconnected from the roar of engines. It’s like nature watching, if nature was made of 100-ton metal birds. Now, the decor. Ah, the decor. It’s as if the 90s called and forgot to ask for their interior design back. The charm of the hotel lies in its ability to transport you back to a time when the internet was a novelty and mobile phones were the size of bricks. It’s not outdated; it’s retro-chic without trying, a living museum exhibit titled “The Great Airport Sleepover of ’98.” In conclusion, my stay at the Jakarta Airport Hotel was an adventure in itself. Between the unparalleled convenience, the breakfast time travel, and the nostalgic ambiance, it’s a reminder that sometimes, the journey can be just as memorable as the destination. And if your journey includes a layover here, well, you’re in for a treat."
"108.","Ree Zee","9","2022-12-31","5","The breakfast is superb!! Giving the five stars is under rated, I’ll easily give them more than five stars.

"117.","James Kerr","574","2023-12-31","4","Somewhat hard to find from the sky train, but in a good spot close to the terminal. Food is good and staff are lovely. Ask for a room close to reception so you're not walking 1.5km down the corridor to your room."

Check in and extension of our checkout time (since we were waiting for a late flight) went smoothly. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant, but we did have easy access to a range of in-airport restaurants within walking distance as well as some stores (most notably a convenience store with strawberry slushies that my friend still raves about). The price was very affordable."

Believing them I stayed up all night uploading, and didn’t make it. Fearful of my job, I went into the airport right next door and the internet there was super fast! But the staff at hotel said they shared the airport WiFi but did not! All I had to do was visit a coffee shop in airport to get WiFi. For anyone needing WiFi, avoid. For everyone else, a good stay over hotel. Clean and located perfectly."

As I had to wait over 20 hours for my flight I came here to eat right upon entry in Indonesia and until I left Jakarta I have been eating here, as well as take take out to Sorong.

"135.","Regina","209","2020-12-31","3","Ini pertama kalinya saya menginap di hotel ini. Saya menginap disini karena pihak maskapai reschedule penerbangan saya secara sepihak tanpa pemberitahuan apapun yang saya dapat ! Karena terlalu kesal dan emosi, saya pun memutuskan untuk segera mungkin beristirahat dan mencari tempat terdekat, tidak sengaja saya melihat hotel ini karena kebetulan saya sedang berada di T2. Saat checkin sebagai walk in guest, saya bertanya berapa room rate untuk 1 malam. Dan FO menjawab Rp. 900.000,- / night untuk tipe kamar executive deluxe .. Dan saya menanyakan apakah ada tipe dibawah itu dengan harga yang agak masuk akal ? Kemudian front desk agent itu mengatakan tidak ada, karena kebetulan hotel sedang full... Menurut saya , ini harga yang kurang wajar ya untuk hotel tua yang kelebihannya hanya berada dalam terminal.. Jujur saya, ini lebih mahal daripada harga tiket saya yang hanya 800 ribuan .. 😂 Tapi pada akhirnya, saya tetap checkin kok. Karena saya sudah terlalu lelah untuk membawa barang2 lagi dan berpikir untuk mencari hotel lain. Dengan 1 kelebihan, hotel ini ternyata lebih banyak minusnya. Saya minta kamar yang tidak terlalu jauh dari lobby tapi tidak dipenuhi. Saya diberi room nomor 30 yang berada di tengah2. Kemudian ketika ingin masuk kamar, kunci tidak bisa digunakan ! Untungnya waktu itu saya dibantu oleh bellboy yang mengangkatkan barang saya, jadi dia membuka pintu kamar dengan mastercard nya. Ketika masuk kamar, saya langsung merebahkan diri dan baru saja berpikir untuk membuka OTA, dan iseng2 membuka hotel ini. And what ? Ternyata ada pilihan tipe kamar dengan harga yang cukup miring.. What theee.......? Baru kali ini saya menemukan bahwa walk in guest dijadikan subjek untuk mengambil keuntungan lebih dimasa pandemi yang sulit ini ~~ Saya pernah jadi orang perhotelan, dan pengalaman saya, meskipun harga yang ditawarkan OTA lebih murah, tapi room rate untuk walk in guest tidak pernah sejauh itu perbedaannya ! But, nasi sudah jadi bubur. Saya memang apes hari ini. Mencoba menenangkan diri dengan menonton TV, ternyata channel TV nya tidak lengkap sama sekali. Banyak channel yang tidak ada dan itu sangat menyebalkan untuk saya ! Saat masih di FO, saya sudah mengatakan ingin meminjam mukena dan sajadah, tapi tidak datang2 sampai saya kembali keluar untuk cari makan.. Ngomong2 tentang makanan, dengan room rate 900k / night, di hotel ini tidak tersedia sarapan. Wow benar2 menambah nilai minusnya ! Saya ga tau ya dengan hotel2 transit lainnya, tapi ya aneh aja gitu dengan breakfast yang ditiadakan ini. Oke setelah bicara tentang kekurangannya , mari kita bahas tentang kelebihannya. Ga banyak sih, tapi ya lumayan lah masih ada kelebihannya. Yang pertama, ada di lokasi yang sangat pas untuk orang yang ingin mepet2 aja checkin nya. Karena berada di dalam area terminal 2 itu sendiri ! Persis di samping apron pesawat. Dan dari kamar kita bisa melihat pesawat take off ataupun landing. Dan yang kedua, meskipun berada sangat dekat dengan pesawat, suara dari luar tidak kedengaran sama sekali ! Benar2 kedap suara dan itu oke banget. Kayaknya itu saja deh yang bisa saya ulas pada kesempatan kali ini. Jika ditanya apakah saya akan menginap lagi ? Yaaaa dalam keadaan tertentu, mungkin bisa saja ! Tapi saya akan booked via OTA."

Since the check-in time is at 2 pm, a few days ago I wrote an email to the hotel to ask if it was possible to anticipate it and the very kind Lia told us that they would do their best to give us the room at 11 am .

It got every standard toiletry and hot showers in its bathroom. Sadly, if you're unlucky enough, you'll have to walk a long way to get into your room. The lobby is at the middle of the airport's second terminal. The guest rooms are in this long hallway which you have to walk through to get into your room. It can be a little tiring exercise for your legs if you brought along a lot of heavy stuffs so I suggest asking the hotel's porter to bring your cases."

"144.","Michael Myers","8","2022-12-31","3","Cons: Was a bit different from how it's portrayed in it's online advertising where it is made up to be modern and chic. Accidentally went to the nice hotel in the international terminal first, and when I arrived here it was a bit disappointing in comparison. It felt like a nice hotel circa 1970s or 1980s. But to be honest the whole terminal is a bit old and outdated. There was only one person on the front desk and had to wait standing for a long while after a very long and exhausting journey. Room was a bit dingy, especially the bathroom. And there was only 10 or so channels on the tv. Pros:. The restaurant was excellent and above expectation. The nasi bakar was delicious. It was the ONLY PLACE IN THE AIRPORT TO BUY BEER as far as I could find, including the international terminal. It's location is very convenient for domestic travel. All of the staff were very very polite, helpful, friendly and professional. In sum: I was hoping for a bit of luxury and some feelings of home after a long hard stint working in the kampung and some of the rougher parts of the city. And while I don't think the hotel quite met the mark for luxury, it was comfortable, convenient, and has a wonderful staff."

Pelayanan sangat baik, barang dibawakan sampai kamar dan saat check out dibawakan kebawah dan dicarikan troli. Ada layanan print tapi agak mahal, 15k/lembar. Kamar luas dengan karpet, heater, air minum 2 botol, safety box, kulkas, toiletteries. Pemandangan langsung landasan. Lemari luas, kamar mandi bersih dan air berfungsi baik. Hotelnya bentuknya memanjang gitu, jadi kamarnya agak jauh jalannya."

However, the burgers we ordered were inedible: stale bun and tiny patty with crunchy bits of mystery meat. I see that others have commented that the food was good or the room was bad. This just underscores a common issue we’ve found across Indonesia: a lack of consistency. Some, but not all, of the rooms are good and some, but not all, of the food is good. And you never know which one you’re getting."
"166.","Elz","54","2022-12-31","3","Karena posisi panik bingung mau nginap dimana & udah malam juga. Tanyain sama petugas cs terminal 2 dimana posisi hotel bandara & dikasih petunjuk. Posisi hotel letaknya sebelah kiri dari pintu keluar depan pos polisi. Tapi sayangnya tidak ada plang nama hotel di depan eskalator yg menuju hotel bandara tsb emg ada petujuk arah hotel dmn. Tapi tetap aja ngebingungkan. Yg ada cuma bapak penjaga untuk cek barang di depan eskalator tersebut. Karena saya tidak menemukan hotel tsb lalu saya bertanya kepada bapak yg jaga dimana hotelnya? Lalu dia bertanya sudah booking atau belum? Jika belum harga kamar hotel tsb 1 malam 1 jt kelas standar & deluxe 1 jt lebih (bpk ga sebutin lebih berapa). Otomatis kaget dong.. karena saya cm bakalan nginap utk 5 jam menjelang jam 3 pagi. Lalu dia mengarahkan saya ke hotel diluar bandara dengan harga 400rbuan. Dan saya ambil hotel diluar itu. Tapi pas saya cek kembali di traveloka ternyata harga hotel bandara di terminal 2 itu cm sekitaran 300an. Wah parah itu bpk2!!! memanfaatin kesempatan dlm kesempitan. Mungkin dia mau ngelakukan hotel rekan2nya diluar bandara & dia juga dapat fee jika ada yg nginap makanya dia naruh tarif hotel bandara setinggi itu. Semoga pihak bandara soeta bisa memperbaiki & menertipkan manajemen kerjanya dalam melayani custommers. Bandara soeta itu ngebingungkan. Apa lagi pernah transit dibiarkan aja cari bus sendiri ato kereta sendiri tanpa diarahin sama petugasnya. Padahal itu bandara internasional nomor 1 di indonesia tapi pelayanannya kurang bagus."

What I like about this hotel: the room has view to the air field, you can see airplanes taking off, landing, parking all the time just from your window. If you walk outside, you can find lots of food tenants inside the airport terminal, so finding food is no issue here. Also, because of the location, you can go directly to airport check in no time. What I consider some thing need to be improved: during busy hour, I found the receptionists were overwhelmed. Probably the hotel needs to find a way to shorten check in process. Another thing, the entrance to the hotel is via a narrow stairs and eskalator, it can create difficulties for you sometimes."

"222.","Claire Jones","27","2019-12-31","3","This hotel had good and bad points. Good - room was nice, clean, comfortable bed and pillows, soundproofed windows to outside so couldn't hear planes, extremely convenient located on 2nd floor of Terminal 2 where there are plenty of restaurants and the Skytrain is a free ride between all 3 terminals, friendly staff. and easy check in after I booked online. Bad - foyer smelled like disinfectant cleaner the first time I walked in and cigarette smoke the second time, when I wanted to watch tv the people in the room next door banged on the adjoining wall (even when I turned down the volume to low), restaurant is under construction so no food available at the hotel, can be a long walk to your room as hotel is all on one floor, no staff were available to carry my bags and there didn't seem to be a lift to get from foyer upstairs to the rooms but the stairs had an adjoining ramp to drag your bag up while you walk next to it on the stairs."
"223.","halliya citrasari","91","2021-12-31","4","Lokasi di terminal 2E jadi klo mau flight pagi gak buru2, kamar nya seperti lorong jadi lumayan jalan jauh. Kamar bersih, pelayanan baik, selama pandemi tidak ada breakfast dan layanan restoran."
"224.","Ramdani Sama","55","2022-12-31","5","Mau dibilang gimanapun, kalo transit pasti selalu di CGK... Lagian di Indonesia, keknya ga ada yg lbh bagus dan lengkap drpd CGK... Hanya aja ya tiap Terminal beda²... Kudu pinter dan sering nanya kalo buta... Terus kemewahan ruang tunggu tergantung terminal, artinya ya tergantung naik pesawat apa... Ruang tunggu Garuda ya beda sm Lion Group... Ruang tunggu domestik ya beda dgn Internasional apalagi yg pesawat² bagus kek Qatar Airways..."
"225.","Cagan Hakki Sekercioglu","412","2018-12-31","1","Avoid. Noisy. I had to change my flight and leave 2 days earlier due to a family health emergency. Despite writing to them 3 days in advance and going there in person for a refund 2 days before my reservation. Now my credit card company is dealing with them. There are much better places very close to the airport for half the price and with free shuttles."
"226.","Pimonrat Tiansawat","311","2018-12-31","4","Comfortable and convenient when you do not have much time to stay in the city and commute back again. We got a runway view which is awesome. Also easy to find food."

We asked why?? He said that the room hasn’t been cleaned. What?! They gave us a room that hasn’t been cleaned? What kind of hotel is this that didn’t cooperate at all. How can you give out the room without making sure all ready. Super dissapointed. And also they didn’t compensate at all for this fatal mistake We definitely are waiting to hear from the hotel about this"

Look for ‘Transit hotel’ sign. The hotel itself is quite old, no escalator only stairs but if you carry suitcase theres a place to slide it (idk whats its called) the room is clean. If you dont wanna walk so much, choose room in number between 40 - 50 because its near the stairs."
"241.","Alfrets & Connie","189","2021-12-31","5","Very nice hotel, clean room and sanitized. The staff are friendly..Check in during PPKM, only for 12 hours transit flight and I'm satisfied. I don't have anything to complaint."

Kamarnya cukup luas untuk ukuran hotel transit...harga transit nya juga cukup bersaing...kmrn dapat 400rb per 6 jam tetapi jika lebih dari 6 jam di hitung 1 malam... Lumayan lah hotelnya cukup strategis sehingga tidak perlu jauh2 macet dijalan ketika transit..."
"243.","Orie Lim","51","2020-12-31","5","We stayed this hotel twice. Once when we had a redeye flight back home to LA and another one is when we arrived passed midnight. Both experience is nothing but awesome. The hotel is a little older, good reno would be great. But other than that their service is amazing. Room is clean, staff are friendly and prompt, shuttle service is excellent. I would recommend this hotel to everyone that needs accomodation in CGK."
"244.","Rusli Nugroho","36","2019-12-31","1","Very bad receptionist, I was trying to book for my friend from Korea only for transit which will be paid by his personal account (he is not familiar with booking by apps) but the receptionist insist a guarantee by using my credit card. Although I already give him the flight detail and even ask for airport pick up service and no solution from him. Usually if the arrival is later than 5 or 6 pm hotel will ask for credit card guarantee and it is understandable, but this time my friend will be landed on 3PM. Which is only 3hrs after I make a call."

"255.","Fallen Monk","116","2016-12-31","1","So I was stuck at the airport until my flight in the next day and needed a place to rest for the night. It was conveinent that there was a hotel right here at the airport. There was a hotel staff in front that told me the price per night. 688,000 idr and also includes breakfast. Kinda pricey but I liked the convenience of not having to go elsewhere. So I agreed to pay the fee. First off, no wifi... Even the cheapest hotel has wifi and the airport has free wifi. Second, the a/c machine in my room is older than the room itself. Didn't work very well and woke up sweating in the middle of the night. Lastly, went to get my breakfast that was included and made my way to the restaurant. Oops, my breakfast didn't include that kind of breakfast, it was given to me in a box... Cold, tasteless, and proportions that is sufficient enough for a small child... Ate my breakfast box and I'm still hungry... Gonna head to the airport restaurants somewhere to have a proper breakfast... Worse hotel I've ever stayed in, especially what you paid for..."

Great thing is Skytrain and train to central Jakarta, Shia= Soekarno Hatta International Airport, to Batu Ceper, Duri and BNI city near Sudirman station, cost only 50.000rp /pax= 4 usd. Previous Governors did a good job. Traffic in Jakarta was much more clogged in the past."
"259.","Justin Cupler","173","2018-12-31","4","Best Rp525,000 I've ever spent. Our Airbnb forced us to check out 6 hours before our flight, so we were planning to just sit around the airport for that time. Then we saw the Airport Hotel and checked it out. For just rp525,0000 (about $35), we got a comfy ministry room that gave us a nice space to spread out in and catch some sleep before our long flight back to the u.s. And they even keep your luggage in a safe space during your stay for free. The room was un surprisingly good shape with a clear view of the runways."

We arrived at 23:45 and we departed a week later at 06:15, this hotel was right in the terminal and was super convenient to not have to deal with traffic and get some good sleep before and after the long flight. The only downside was the hot water in the room ran out after 2 minutes."
"262.","Jan","243","2018-12-31","5","Very good place to rest during a long layover. They even offer short stays that let you stay for 6 hours for a very low price (about 500.000 IDR). Very clean, quiet and right above Terminal 2."

"599.","Devi Sagita Ratri","8","2025-01-21","1","Saat saya memesan dari aplikasi Agoda yang mana seharusnya hal ini adalah kerjasama dengan pihak hotel Jakarta Airport Hotel, saya merasa dibohongi karena seharusnya pembayaran adalah hal yg seharusnya paling DIMUDAHKAN pihak HOTEL. Saya ingin segera membayar, dan mendapatkan bukti bayar namun di AGODA pihak HOTEL hanya memberikan opsi debit/credit, pembayaran lewat debit tidak langsung bisa ditarik oleh pihak hotel, namun harus bayar langsung di hotel sementara saya memesankan untuk client, (masa client harus bayarin hotel dulu di tempat kalo misal ada masalah dengan pembayaran debit) terkadang pembayaran melalui debit beberapa kali tertolak walaupun saat itu saldo debit tersedia beberapa kali lipat dari yg seharusnya dibutuhkan, bahkan ketika saya berusaha menelpon pihak hotel, hotel terus berkelit dengan mengatakan bahwa pembayaran harus dilakukan di hotel dan itu adalah SOP. SOP mana yang malah menyulitkan customer membayar, hal ini sangat menghambat saya untuk melakukan administrasi kantor. Hotel tidak mau memberikan kemudahan dan tidak memberikan opsi penyelesaian masalah selain dengan yang mereka berikan (Pembayaran ditarik saat hari H customer datang). Selain tanpa solusi pihak HOTEL tidak memiliki komunikasi yang baik karena tidak bisa menjelaskan dasar keputusan dari ketidak mampuannya menarik pembiayaan segera, ditambah dengan sikap yang AROGAN. Minus banget, tanpa penyelesaian. Pengalaman pertama dan terkahir saya disini. Saya yakin banyak hotel yang Jauh lebih baik namun lebih Affordable dari Jakarta Airport Hotel. Kalau ditanya KENAPA TIDAK DIBATALKAN SAJA? KARENA PIHAK HOTEL TIDAK MENYEDIAKAN KEBIJAKAN UNTUK CANCEL BAIK DARI HOTEL NYA ATAU DARI APLIKASI, KARENA TIDAK AKAN DI REFUND WALAUPUN SAYA PESAN MASIH ADA 8 HARI (11 NOVEMBER 2024) SEBELUM AKHIRNYA MENGINAP DI TANGGAL 19 NOVEMBER 2024. APAKAH TIDAK ADA KETERANGAN DARI AWAL BAYAR DI HOTEL? TIDAK ADA. SILAHKAN LIHAT DI GAMBAR JADI BENAR2 TIDAK ADA PENYELESAIAN YANG WIN WIN SOLUTION. Makasih buat mas2 yang ga bisa ngasih solusi via telpon kantor hotel tanggal 11 November 2024 jam 15.46, BAD ATTITUDE."

Kinda pricey but I liked the convenience of not having to go elsewhere. So I agreed to pay the fee. First off, no wifi... Even the cheapest hotel has wifi and the airport has free wifi. Second, the a/c machine in my room is older than the room itself. Didn't work very well and woke up sweating in the middle of the night. Lastly, went to get my breakfast that was included and made my way to the restaurant. Oops, my breakfast didn't include that kind of breakfast, it was given to me in a box... Cold, tasteless, and proportions that is sufficient enough for a small child... Ate my breakfast box and I'm still hungry... Gonna head to the airport restaurants somewhere to have a proper breakfast... Worse hotel I've ever stayed in, especially what you paid for..."

"619.","Jules Brookfield","338","2012-01-21","1","Probably the worst international airport in the world for a city of this size and the capital of a country.

Shower clogged and curtain ripped, but most importantly it’s in the wrong terminal, so if your flight is early the tram is closed and shuttle is only on the hour. We found ourselves trying to negotiate a 300,000 rupee taxi for only 10 mins of travel time!"
"716.","S Smith","152","2023-01-21","2","The first room I was given was in poor repair. The AC dripped water on the floor, the doors on the closet were almost falling off, there were cracks etc in the walls, closet doors were almost falling off and would not shut completely leaving a light on that i couldn't turn off. And worst of all the shower would not drain. I complained and the staff came in to fix it and found a hug and super disgusting clump of hair and i dont know what else clogging the drain. I was completely grossed out. However, once they put me in a different room, everything was fine. The room was in decent repair and everything worked. Restaurant is fine and location is good for long layovers. Just be sure to fully check out your room before trying to settle in or relax. Evidently they have some that are much better than others."

They are incapable and irresponsible. The toilet is stuck. Poor service and slow everywhere here."
"718.","Samuel Vartek","29","2024-01-21","2","The location is great, right at airport, for an overnight stay. The room is small but fine. My issue was the WiFi, which was crawling slow and I had to work and upload files. The staff did not help, they sent a tech who said they’d have to have the whole airport restart modem. Believing them I stayed up all night uploading, and didn’t make it. Fearful of my job, I went into the airport right next door and the internet there was super fast! But the staff at hotel said they shared the airport WiFi but did not! All I had to do was visit a coffee shop in airport to get WiFi. For anyone needing WiFi, avoid. For everyone else, a good stay over hotel. Clean and located perfectly."

"753.","Mercy E","156","2025-01-21","2","Fungsional, tetapi tidak direkomendasikan Kami menginap sebentar di hotel ini selama sekitar 6 jam untuk menyegarkan diri setelah perjalanan 20 jam sebelum melanjutkan perjalanan selama 24 jam. Meskipun kami membayar harga untuk menginap semalam penuh, kami merasa tidak diperlakukan dengan baik secara keseluruhan. Resepsionis awalnya mengizinkan kami check-in lebih awal, tetapi 10 menit kemudian menelepon kami untuk memberi tahu bahwa akan ada biaya tambahan. Ia bisa saja memberikan informasi ini langsung saat check-in, yang akan menghemat kerumitan yang tidak perlu. Pelayanannya juga kurang: Ketika saya meminta handuk ketiga, saya mengalami kesulitan yang tidak perlu. Kamar hanya menyediakan dua handuk dan keset kamar mandi – jelas tidak cukup untuk tiga orang. Ketelnya juga sangat berkapur, yang semakin merusak kesan keseluruhan. Hotel ini mungkin cukup fungsional untuk menginap singkat, tetapi dengan pelayanan yang mengecewakan, Anda tidak bisa berharap banyak."
"754.","Seungjoon Park (박승준)","66","2023-01-21","2","Kelebihan: Terletak di dalam bandara. Layanan antar-jemput gratis tersedia kapan saja. Kekurangan: Pintu masuknya hanya tangga, jadi Anda harus membawa barang bawaan yang berat. Sarapannya kurang enak. Anda bisa mendengar suara pesawat dengan sangat jelas. Kondisi kamar kurang baik. Harganya kurang terjangkau. Saya jarang membaca email. Pesan saja hotel bintang 3 lain di luar bandara."
"755.","Claudia","22","2025-01-21","2","Kamarnya sangat kuno. Kami mendapat dua tempat tidur queen. Tidak ada suara pesawat. Layanan antar-jemput gratis, stafnya sangat ramah. Sarapan disajikan mulai pukul 03.00."
"756.","T Iu","546","2020-01-21","2","Dengan rute Narita dan Haneda yang sekarang berada di Terminal 3, hotel di Terminal 2 ini menjadi sedikit kurang nyaman. Namun, letaknya tepat setelah turun dari Skytrain, jadi masih cukup berguna. Karena bandaranya panjang dan sempit, kamar-kamar di ujung agak repot untuk berjalan kaki. Kamarnya biasa saja. Bersih dan bagus. Namun, ada beberapa detail kecil yang mengganggu saya, seperti pengering rambut di kamar yang rusak. Makanannya mengecewakan. Ada pojok roti gratis di pagi hari, tetapi tutup untuk penerbangan pagi. Ada banyak restoran di bandara setelah pemeriksaan keamanan, tetapi sangat sedikit yang ada di luar, jadi mungkin sulit menemukannya di pagi hari. Saya juga menggunakannya sebagai tempat beristirahat setelah kedatangan, tetapi tidak ada pilihan menginap singkat, jadi saya akhirnya membayar untuk menginap semalam. Secara keseluruhan, saya berharap mereka bisa lebih berusaha."
"757.","Lorena Navarro Carmona","3","2019-01-21","2","Kamarnya lumayan, tapi agak mahal untuk fasilitasnya, apalagi mengingat harga di Jawa. Anda harus membayar untuk menginap di bandara, karena sarapan tidak termasuk, seharga €70 per malam. Kami memilih menginap di sini karena penerbangan pagi ke Yogyakarta keesokan harinya, tapi yang kami tidak tahu adalah lokasinya di terminal yang berbeda, jadi kami harus bepergian sendiri, meskipun hotel menawarkan layanan antar-jemput gratis, jadi kami senang dengan itu. Tidak ada lift, jadi kalau membawa koper, harus naik beberapa anak tangga. Seingat saya, tempat tidurnya cukup nyaman, dan ada AC, yang lumayan bagus di Jakarta, karena cuacanya cukup panas."
"758.","山田一郎","99","2022-01-21","2","Saya hanya menginap sekitar 7 jam, jadi tidak masalah, tapi perlu diketahui bahwa tidak ada sabun mandi cair. Yang ada hanyalah sabun padat. Kata sandi Wi-Fi dimulai dengan huruf kapital! Kulkasnya tidak dingin, jadi sebaiknya suhunya dinaikkan ke maksimum."

"801.","Ed Delaporte","5","2026-01-14","3","Stayed one night. Rooms were clean and showed no signs of bed bug infestations. Bell staff were EXTREMELY helpful. Over the top service. Breakfast was great, the young lady hosting was gracious, helpful and engaging. The downside: absolutely no hot water. Cold showers don't bother me much, I grew up with cold showers. However, if you enjoy a warm to hot shower, this is NOT your hotel."
"802.","Darryl Chew","240","2025-12-21","3","A suitable spot for an overnight if you have a connecting flight to catch. Rooms are clean and easy to get to. They have also a storage area where you can leave luggage you do not need to use during your stay."
"803.","Ira Alamsyah","12","2025-08-21","3","If you’ve got a crack‑of‑dawn flight and don’t fancy a morning marathon through the airport, this place is your lifesaver. We booked it for one night before our umrah flight through the hajj terminal, and staying right in Terminal 2D was a total game‑changer—just a short stroll to check‑in. The room? Nothing fancy. The decor is dated, but the bed’s comfy and everything was clean. The real treat was the window facing the runway—grown‑ups will feel like kids again watching the planes roll by. Breakfast kicks off at 3 AM and has more variety than you’d expect. I stuck to tea, but my family seemed to enjoy the spread. Yes, it’s a bit pricey, but you’re paying for unbeatable location and zero morning stress. For my next super‑early flight, I’d book here again without thinking twice."
"804.","Hin","284","2025-07-21","3","Room, bed, and towels were clean and in fair condition. But hot water wasn’t really hot and bathroom and toilet isn’t too clean. Best location for early morning flight. Also, breakfast are terrible."
"805.","Alwi Dahlan","69","2025-12-21","3","Parkiran nya tidak bersahabat mahal nguras kantong buat driver travel sama bus pariwisata"
"806.","CJ","7","2025-03-21","3","Wlpn saya pesan sarapan American pas check-in, ternyata saat check out. Tidak ada. Mba yg bertugas d depan mngkn lupa pesanin. Ternyata, wlpn termaduk d harga, tdk ada jamin bisa bnr2 dapat. Saya sangat kecewa dengan Jamarta Airport Hotel. Dulu sy stay d situ 2/3 setahun, tetapi sy akan nyari opsi lain."
"807.","Heidi Fisher","78","2025-01-21","3","If you have to spend the night in Jakarta, this is a very convenient place to stay. Room was pretty clean but although we were no-smoking side, you could still smell smoke. You can also hear the flight announcements all night. We were only there 7 hrs between flights and that was enough. Glad to have a place to sleep but it was the worst place we stayed in our couple weeks traveling. And they really need to invest in new towels."
"808.","Michael D.","197","2025-01-21","3","This place is recommendable. The hotel does not have an elevator. You can easily reach the terminals or the train from the hotel. The rooms are simple. The air is stale. The windows cannot be opened for security reasons. Breakfast could not be offered to me. Although I booked and paid for the room for one day!"
"809.","L T","257","2025-01-21","3","Location - conveniently located within terminal 2 and connected by shuttle train service between the terminals. However, the access is via a flight of stairs followed by escalator. If you have heavy luggages, this can be challenging. Although there’s some sort of conveyor belt to bring the luggage up but it was not operational when we got there and there was no porter in sight too to help. Service - friendly service in general. The breakfast starts at 3 am which is amazing for early flights. Food is average. A huge plus is the airport shuttle service to other terminals. Just book and enquire at reception. Rooms - dated furnishings. Worst of all, there was a blood stain on the duvet cover. This is still unacceptable even if it is a clean sheet with stain that cannot be removed. Further, repair work was ongoing even at 11 pm. The drilling and hammering noise was almost unbearable. Although we were so closely located next to the runway (as seen in the photo taken from the hotel room), there was no disturbance from the planes."
"810.","Amy Toi","36","2024-01-21","3","Stayed at the Jakarta Airport Hotel for one night before catching an early morning flight the following day. While the hotel is quite basic and in need of some renovations, the staff's friendliness and helpfulness made the stay bearable. The rooms themselves are a bit dated, with outdated furniture and a lack of modern amenities like hairdryers or irons. The safe in my room was also broken, and the toilet flush was quite weak. Additionally, the pillowcase on my bed had a noticeable stain. Upon requesting a replacement, the housekeeper who was cleaning the next room promptly provided me with a fresh pillowcase. Despite the hotel's shortcomings, I must commend the staff for their genuine hospitality and willingness to assist guests. The concierge was particularly helpful in providing information and addressing my requests. The hotel offers a complimentary breakfast, which was simple but adequate. It consisted of basic staples like bread, cereal, and eggs and traditional Indonesian morning porridge. Overall, the Jakarta Airport Hotel is a decent option for those seeking a convenient and affordable place to stay near the airport."
"811.","Kitty Lakatos","29","2024-01-21","3","Pros: - Very friendly and polite staff. - The room is clean, the bed is comfy. - The view is awesome! - The breakfast selection is limited, but the food is tasty. Cons: - It is very annoying to carry the bags on the stairs - The edge of the towel frays - The fridge needs maintenance, because is not working properly"
"812.","Henk Smit","53","2024-01-21","3","I was here for a short stay between my connecting flights. Convenient that it is on the airport, but the rest is so so. Bathroom is ok and clean, but old. It is noisy. In the room you van hear the airport announcements. Next time? With short time in between I might go again. But with a little more time, I will drive to a more modern hotel (or maybe find it on the airport in different Terminal)"
"813.","archie fleay","51","2024-01-21","3","Hotel layout make a bit difficult to walk up stairs… but staff are kind to help with luggage. Room old fashioned, too warm when check in… need time for room to cool from air cond. Fridge is working good, keep food and drinks cold. Sleep is peaceful and quiet when no flights taking place."
"814.","Simon Proudman","1380","2024-01-21","3","Location is key to this hotel. Inbetween the arrival and departure areas of Terminal 2. Dated rooms but quiet enough. Biggest issue is a lack of lift or escalator. Just lots of steps and steep ramps to drag your luggage up or down which is not ideal if you have a few bags."
"815.","Waqar Ali Gill","145","2025-01-21","3","Very confused location its on terminal 2 gate 4 and all the international flights landed on terminal 1. From T1 to T2 you need a taxi who will charge you between 10 to 20$ and 20 minutes. Becareful drivers are also not good and very tricky. Hotel is old and small. Rooms are also very small i think the photos here are old."

"817.","bliss Song","206","2024-01-21","3","The waiting time at Terminal 2 was too long, so I used a restaurant. There are no using place in Terminal 2 to use late at night. I didn't look at the room. The restaurant was clean and friendly, but it smelled like cigarettes because it was connected to the smoking area."
"818.","galoeh adhiesetyo","124","2021-01-21","3","I was in room number 11. The room is far from receptionist, the shortcut i think better to accelerate access to room with small number. You will feel in the old hotel due to the furniture was vintage style. The towel was bad (edge of towel was torn). Hotel shall provide good quality of towel. It is really disappointed. The bed room was really big. Love it!"

"821.","Superdumpling Photos","124","2018-01-21","3","Room is decent, good enough for an overnight transit. Around 1am , we were woken up with hammering noise from outside. We called reception and were promptly moved to a different room. …"
"822.","Kevin","56","2020-01-21","3","It is ok for a night. Rooms are small but like I said ok for a night. Very convenient if you have an early flight so you don’t have to deal with traffic as it can take 1-6 hrs to get anywhere in Jakarta sometimes. …"

"825.","Christophe Stevens","440","2019-01-21","3","It was okay and nice to see the planes from the room. The service was okay without being super. In the morning we had a shuttle service and their clock was 5 minutes ahead which generated lots of stress. ( They said that we were late and we had to run to go to the shuttle)"
"826.","CMChina遣使會","824","2020-01-21","3","Sebagai hotel transit cukup bagus, namun kebersihan dan koridor kurang terang, handuknya sdh terlalu tua, usang dan terkesan kotor kurang higienis. Aroma kamar juga kurang sedap, sekat antar kamar kurang kedap suara sehingga suara kamar awbelah terdengar jelas dan mengganggu."
"827.","Dave Andrew","114","2019-01-21","3","Location is great, right by terminal 2. Rooms have a view to the active runway which is awesome. Room is basic and clean. Overall decor of the hotel could use some work though."
"828.","Jhonsen Xaverious","41","2020-01-21","3","Yang saya rasakan selalu ada update dr pengelola dr segi kebersihan atupun fasilitas penunjang bandara walaupun bisa dibilang agak lambat krn dr bnyk aspek bandara utama kita ini sudah sangat tertinggal jika di bandingkan dengan bandara negara lain."
