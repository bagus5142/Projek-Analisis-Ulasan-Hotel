"1.","Peter Reinhardt","36","2025-12-01","5","This is an excellent choice for an airport hotel. We booked via Expedia and exchanged several messages to arrange their free airport transport. The pickup point was a walk from international arrivals, but a smiling driver easily found us when we arrived after midnight. The staff is super friendly and helpful, and it was so nice that no one was expecting a tip. The breakfast has lots of yummy choices, and we had a nice, simple dinner there too. The rooms are well-appointed (with robes) but smallish for a hotel of this class."
"2.","Wawan Soerachman","89","2025-12-10","5","Impeccable service from the hotel team members. From management to pool service restaurant staff. Great looking hotel with resort feeling to it. Breakfast choices are plentiful. Complimentary shuttle to CGK airport is a plus. Lounge access for the titanium elite member is good, although complimentary Beers and wine would be a nice addition to the lounge benefit inline with other Sheraton hotels lounges in Jakarta. We had a great stay. Thank you."
"3.","Veer Bharwani","5","2025-12-10","5","Went for a wedding here and stayed 2 nights. It was amazing really spacious and gave great comfortable vibes. Breakfast was amazing, and the café in the lobby had great service. The rooms were really big, clean, and nice. Definitely deserves 5 stars, and I really recommend it for anyone checking in near Jakarta International Airport."
"4.","Mia Novita sari","5","2025-07-31","5","I stayed at Sheraton Bandara on July 15–16 and had a truly pleasant experience. Triana from the reservation team was very helpful, friendly, and responsive. I booked the stay for a special occasion, and everything was arranged beautifully. All the hotel staff were warm and welcoming, which made me feel very comfortable throughout my stay. The hotel has a peaceful and calming atmosphere, perfect for anyone looking for a quiet and relaxing getaway. The service was truly excellent. I did encounter a minor issue when trying to connect to Netflix on the TV, a message appeared asking me to contact the hotel staff. However, I was already quite tired and chose not to follow up. It wasn’t a big deal for me One small suggestion it would be helpful if the security staff at the entrance could inform guests when parking at the hotel lobby is unavailable, to avoid confusion or unnecessary back and forth when looking for a parking spot. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Sheraton Bandara and would highly recommend it.✨"

The breakfast team, including Caca, Nazwa, and Aniza, provided excellent service. For dinner, I opted for the &More restaurant and would like to extend my gratitude to Simar for the outstanding service. This hotel also features a mini zoo and a lovely swimming pool."
"6.","Salsa Mesya","1","2025-10-31","5","Alhamdulillah, my experience at Sheraton Jakarta Soekarno Hatta Airport Hotel was truly exceptional. I had the pleasure of being treated to a rejuvenating spa massage by the incredibly skilled and friendly therapist, Wiji. Her professionalism and expertise were evident in every stroke and technique, leaving me feeling deeply relaxed and refreshed. Wiji's warm smile and attentive service made me feel at ease, and I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the spa. Jazakumullah khairan, Wiji, for an outstanding treatment. Your dedication to your craft is truly appreciated. Insha Allah, I will return and recommend your services to everyone."
"7.","Syahrial Lubis","9","2025-10-01","4","Stayed here as we need to catch an early morning flight from CGK. Room is spacious, clean and modernly decorated and renovated. The hotel's public area including Lobby & Restaurants have also been renovated to a more modern feel. Only the corridor leading to the rooms still has that 90''s feel (the hotel originally opened as Sheraton Bandara back in the 90's/early 2000's). Despite this is an airport hotel but it feels like staying in a resort as the design is low rise and consist of cluster of buildings overlooking an artificial lake. Love to stay there again if we have an early flight out of CGK."

Mungkin kedepan ya bisa banyak lagi promo ya buat member marriot bonvoi"
"9.","Noura","3","2025-12-01","2","We arrived early and asked for early check-in. The staff said they would prepare another room since our booked room wasn’t ready, and asked us to wait by the pool. We waited for a long time with no update. We ended up eating at the restaurant, and only when the staff called the reception did we find out the alternative room was already ready — but no one informed us. In the end, the “early room” was only one hour earlier than our actual check-in. The room had poor ventilation; the AC was too cold, and turning it off made the room too hot to sleep. Breakfast options were average. The best thing about the hotel is its close proximity to the airport."
"10.","John Ricardo","1","2025-10-31","5","My wife and I deliberately vacationed in Indonesia, and stayed at the Sheraton Airport Hotel to take a short break to restore our energy, it turned out that the Sheraton Airport Hotel was extraordinary. It provides comfort and the receptionist was very friendly, the facilities were complete and it turned out there was a spa too, and I stopped by Annathaya Spa, was greeted by the spa receptionist and given a spa menu, I took a 60-minute traditional massage treatment, the massage was very fitting for my tired body, and very detailed when massaging the body, good massage techniques, and I was massaged by therapists Wiji and Bella. Highly recommended, I will definitely come back another time."
"11.","soroush salmani","70","2025-10-01","5","Loved our two days stay at this hotel. The breakfast is next level and the staff is super kind and professional. Special thanks to Kevin who took a great care of us. We loved our stay and you were definitely the reason behind it. Highly recommend this place if you want a nice place near the airport."
"12.","Leony Kartika","4","2025-07-31","5","Our family and I stayed one night, and it was truly a pleasant experience. We were greeted by friendly service. The hotel room was spacious and clean. The restaurant offered a complete menu, from Asian to Western, all freshly prepared. The supporting facilities were complete and clean, including gym, a playground, a mini zoo, and a children's pool. Very satisfying."
"13.","Freya Sophia","3","2025-10-31","5","I recently stayed at the Sheraton Jakarta Soekarno Hatta Airport Hotel and had an exceptional experience! The hotel's facilities were top-notch, especially the Annathaya Spa, which offered an outstanding massage treatment. The therapists were professional, skilled, and made me feel completely relaxed. The spa area was clean, serene, and very comfortable. The hotel's restaurant also impressed me with its delicious food and extensive menu options. I particularly enjoyed the variety of dishes available. Overall, I highly recommend the Sheraton Jakarta Soekarno Hatta Airport Hotel for its excellent service, comfortable stay, and fantastic spa experience. I'll definitely be back!"
"14.","Murad Samaren","167","2025-07-31","4","I love this hotel however location is not good except for airport close. Room are clean, neat. Staff are helpful, respectful and always smile. Special thanks to receptionist THEO was so helpful and helped me in understanding Traveloka payment. Food breakfast was stunning traditional and international food are there with high sheraton standard. Fish outside near fountain were amusing specially if you have kids. However, I couldn't find activities outside the hotel in closer area. Even decent coffee shops are not around. I would go to central Jakarta for variety of activities."
"15.","Kim아영","6","2025-10-01","1","Never use the towels at this hotel. After my shower, the towel turned black just from drying my body. It smelled exactly like a dirty mop. The stains and the overall filthy look made it obvious that these towels had been used for cleaning before being given to guests. Another so-called clean towel even had a dead mosquito stuck in it. Completely disgusting. The towels here are not safe or hygienic. If you stay at this hotel, bring your own towels or you’ll regret it. I never expected to have such an experience at a Sheraton. Truly shocking and unacceptable."
"16.","Slavko Kocijancic","261","2025-10-01","4","We have chosen this hotel since there were protests in Central Jakarta and the hotel is near the airport. Otherwise the location is not that good. Noise insulation in the room is weak so it is loud because of aircrafts. In a walking distance (less than 30 minutes) just a couple of restaurants, no matkets. Chairs at the terrace are not clean, room facilities are average. I wouldn't say it is 5 star hotel. Swimming pool is nice, staff is friendly and work is done adequately. Breakfast was good, but not superb."
"17.","Yosra Hijazy","28","2025-10-01","3","We thought the hotel was inside the airport, but it’s actually 15 minutes away. Breakfast was good and the rooms were nice, but the first room had no balcony or window and felt very stuffy. We paid extra to change rooms, but the new room was right on the hallway with no privacy. The layout requires long walks to reception. Overall, I didn’t enjoy my stay and wouldn’t recommend this hotel."
"18.","Chuleeporn Dechakaisaya","11","2025-10-01","1","I am writing to express my disappointment regarding my recent stay. Upon returning from a long flight, I discovered that the shower drain in my room was not functioning, which led to a significant overflow of water that leaked into the main bedroom area. This situation was highly disruptive and required me to request a room change late at night. Although the room was changed promptly, I was surprised that no further service recovery or assistance was offered to compensate for the significant inconvenience. The experience made what should have been a restful night an incredibly exhausting one."
"19.","Giorgio Saluto Girsang","5","2025-10-31","3","The room is great 5stars, the service is great 5stars. The only issue was on the second dinner, the bagel had raw sloppy salmon, pieces that you would normally not put in a sandwich, it should either be smoked or lean raw salmon. The Philly cheese steak was not a Philly cheese steak nor the good type of meat that they promise on the menu, raw meat hard to chew on. Most importantly, the staff is not paid enough, they all deserve a salary raise. So please Sheraton, ensure that all dinners have high standards and ensure to raise the staff's salary cause they really deserve it."
"20.","Amr Al-Kabr","7","2025-07-31","3","Great rooms, although it looks quite outdated from the outside. Rubbish service for a Sheraton, especially when booking the complimentary airport shuttle. Decent but wide spread of breakfast, had better in other hotels in Jakarta. I personally would never stay in this hotel due to its service, however, I hope that all can be improved. It could be noted that the receptionist who handled the airport shuttle booking looked very very blur when I asked regarding for the booking airport shuttle. I hope the hotel does a better service to NOT TARNISH Sheraton’s name and Indonesian hospitality."
"21.","pika cuuu","1","2025-12-10","5","Beberapa hari lalu saya baru berlibur bersama suami dan menginap dihotel sherathon airport, disambut oleh pelayanan yang baik, apa lagi receptionisnya sangat ramah sekali nuansa hotelnya juga nyaman, dan tidak lupa selalu mampir ke annathaya spa buat massage, pijitan yang bagus ditangani oleh profesional massage, sehingga membuat badan jadi relax kembali, sangat merekomendasikan temen2 yg staycation disini buat mampir ke massage nya🥳"
"22.","Anthony Larkin","3","2025-07-31","5","We had an amazing night here. The airport shuttle was perfect and the driver was patient and kind even though our flight was slightly delayed. Breakfast was superb. I took the recommendations of our waitress and she was 💯 correct with her choice of delicious local food. Thank you."
"23.","iing muttakhiroh","176","2025-07-31","4","I believe this is the best hotel near CGK airport. If you are looking for a very nice place for your transit, this place is definitely a must visit. The room is very spacious, the facilities pretty nice and the services are wonderful. The price is little bit high compared to others, but its worth it. They have very comfy bed, fantastic 🚿 (with the nice amenities) , great food (I definitely recommend to order the breakfast. We ordered for sahoor and with 200k, they give us more than what we paid for), and multiple facilities. What we love the most is the flexibility check in/out which is very useful for travellers. The location is not inside airport, but its next to the airport. So you need shuttle (its not suitable for walking distance). They offered free shuttle every hour and you can request for specific hour if they are available. The building itself is very spacious, with outstanding swimming pool and working area, make it perfect for families or couples. Eventho the location is just next to the runway, but the isolation system is very great make it super calming area to rest. Definitely recommend this place for your excellent transit experience."
"24.","Terry Johns","61","2025-10-31","5","A brilliant place to stay if you have a layover in Jakarta. Hotel bus to hotel and back to airport runs every hour. Takes you directly to your terminal. Nice Indonesian style breakfast."
"25.","Elena Fernández","48","2025-08-31","5","Absolutely perfect!!! The best breakfast I have ever tried! The room was impecable. The modern gym and clean gym. A swimming pool to die for and the food was delicious! The Best Choice and even more conveniente since it is super close to the AirPort! It’s a win win! And all the staff are incredibly nice and helpful. And the cherry in top… the spa! Dont you leave without even trying a 60 minute massage. It is a MUST! Plus, you can enjoy the facilities even after the check out, If you have some cree time until your flight."
"26.","Fong","6","2025-07-31","5","I had an exceptional stay at Sheraton Jakarta Soekarno Hatta Airport! From the moment before my arrival, the concierge team reached out to arrange complimentary pick-up services, ensuring a smooth experience. Check-in was professional and efficient, and my room was spacious and spotless. The lounge staff impressed me with their professionalism and even addressed me by my last name — such a personal touch. Breakfast was delicious, and the team went above and beyond to prepare the local drink *bir pletok* for me. I’m excited to stay again and highly recommend this hotel for its outstanding hospitality!"
"27.","R Lesmn","131","2025-10-01","4","If you're looking for a Bali like hotel near Jakarta's airport this is to go. Room is big and nice, some looking at the planes while they passed (but no noise inside the room). Parking for guess too far away n they dont put parking stop blocks while they put light poles casually in the middle of parking space. This actually caused accident."
"28.","Reddy Panggabean","591","2025-10-01","5","Stay here with my family before our flight to Japan. Checkin process was seamlessly smooth. My toddler daughter had a pleasant experience strolling around the hotel. Our breakfast time was delightful, our daughter received drawing utensils to get her occupied. We also received complimentary cake from Dimas and Tika. These compliments really made our day. A good start for our long flight. We hopefully get another chance to stay here next time."
"29.","Cuisine Quest","339","2025-10-01","4","The only reason I gave it four stars is the lack of an executive lounge, which they make up for by a couple included dishes for dinner. Otherwise, standard Marriott excellence, comfortable beds, very beautiful grounds with nicely manicured vegetation. Close to the airport is a bonus!"
"30.","Aaron Bonvin","32","2025-07-31","5","Close to the airport. Staff is very kind, three people took the time to help me with a problem that I had. Breakfast is excellent with lots of choice. The restaurant is also very good and great cocktails too. Rooms are comfortable, sufficient size and clean."
"31.","Afzal Shaikh","147","2025-07-31","5","My son broke his leg and the manager Nidy and his team took care of us like we we’re family. They escorted us to hospital, translated for us and stayed by our side. When they say they take care of you, they literally make you one of their own. To top things off the breakfast is probably the best I have ever had in my life. I would fly back from 🇨🇦 just to stay at this hotel. Just Amazing!"
"32.","Notyourbusiness","322","2025-08-31","4","Great rooms and pool. Nice restaurants. Shuttle service from and to the airport a massive plus. Location wise, it's basically between two runways in the middle of the airport. No convenience stores nearby so you have to rely 100% on food and beverage from the hotel restaurants. Would recommend for a stopover only."
"33.","Apriliya eriyani","6","2025-08-31","5","2 kali menginap di sini , nyaman banget. Hotel bersih , staff smua ramah , makanan enak semua.menginap bersama keluarga sangat nyaman . Anak2 jg nyaman sekali. Next kalo k jakarta bakal nginap d sini lg 🫶🏻"
"34.","Adrian S. (Xie Zhong Feng)","105","2025-05-31","5","Had a very wonderful experience staying here despite only for a night. During check in I realized that I forgot to use the promotional code for free breakfast, but the front desk staff were so patient and allowed me to make a new booking using the code while cancelling the wrong one. Tania from &More cafe also showed excellent hospitality with her great product knowledge and prompt services - rectifying a very minor issue with utmost care. Very recommended to stay here if you are looking for hotels near airport. The design and ambience made you forgot this is located in the busy street of Jakarta thanks to the lush garden and lake."
"35.","MS Madjid","6","2025-12-01","5","Hotel dekat bandara Soekarno Hatta dengan view danau, bersih, nyaman, tenang. Menu breakfast yg bervariasi serta pelayanan waiters yg ramah (Caca)"
"36.","Man Kien","72","2025-07-01","5","Hotel very near to Soekarno Hatta International Airport, transport was easy. Have shuttle too every hour. Me have room with terrace balcony, can walk from room to nearby swimming pool. Have a small animal garden behind with rabbits, parrots and tortoise. Definitely coming back here on next trip. Have all day dining restaurant too and the mocktail is very very nice taste. Definitely recommend to try. Halal too. Staff was super friendly and very nice in explaining to customer, especially Ms Aileen & Ms Oktri, both was professional and nice."
"37.","Heidi Stegmayer","13","2025-07-01","5","My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our time at this Hotel when in between flights to and from CGK! The rooms were very clean and comfortable, the location near the airport was extremely convenient and the pool and grounds were beautiful! But what made this hotel special was the staff! Every single staff member we encountered was genuinely lovely and helpful! The shuttle drivers, front desk staff, porters, cleaners and staff at both restaurants went above and beyond to make us feel welcome! We enjoyed ourselves so much, that we booked a second night before flying home to Canada! We would highly recommend staying at the Sheraton Jakarta Airport and thank all the staff for their kindness!"
"38.","Henry Hsu","392","2025-07-31","5","A very kids friendly hotel with great location. It is near to the PIK and airport. Very suitable for guests who travels only mainly to the north jakarta The service crews from the reception, room, and especially the restaurant are professional, quick to response and friendly I love the local food that they serve for breakfast. I also enjoyed the freshly squeezed fruit juices.. Kudos to Sheraton team"
"39.","B S","822","2025-07-31","5","I got a special rate at the Sheraton Jakarta Airport for the first anniversary. The rate included afternoon tea. Titanium members get a free evening cocktail, free breakfast, and a suite upgrade. Upon check-in, the desk next to me was given a Sheraton anniversary cake, but they didn't give me. While waiting for the afternoon tea to be prepared, the room wasn't ready yet. I had to ask for it before the cake was given. It turned out they were also confused about the package, so the afternoon tea took a long time to prepare, almost an hour. It was a bit disappointing. Luckily, I was upgraded to a suite. After waiting an hour, the room was finally ready. Not only that, but there were a lot of caterpillars in my wing on the first floor, and one entered my room. Luckily, I was aware of it, and my wife and children were not itchy. I kicked the caterpillars from the hallway to the fish pond, which became fish food. The suite consists of a pantry, living room, bedroom, and bathroom. The pantry only contains a refrigerator and a zinc tank, along with a long table. The living room has a sofa, coffee table, desk, and chair, along with a TV. The floor is made of granite tile, so it's a bit chilly, fortunately, the sofa area has carpet. The living room also has a minibar. The coffee is made from Kovré and the tea is made from Dales Estate. There's also coffee capsules. The bedroom has granite tile, and fortunately, the bed is carpeted. The interior is minimalist, typical of the new Sheraton, with light wood tones. There's a sofa bed and a luggage rack. The mattress is comfortable and soft, still shiny. The TV is a 55-inch. The bathroom has a washbasin, closet, and shower, but no bathtub, even though it's a suite. Amenities are comprehensive, with Gilchrist Soames shampoo and soap, meeting Sheraton standards. Facilities include an adult pool, a children's pool, a gym, and a kids' club. The kids' club seems limited. For afternoon tea, which lasted an hour, there were three sweet cakes, three savory snacks, and two cakes. Evening cocktails were served from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM. You could choose one appetizer or soup, one main course, and one dessert per person, so you get two portions each. We chose wild mushroom soup, la plancha barramundi, and fried vermicelli with green chili oxtail. For dessert, we chose the martini panna cotta and dark chocolate torajan coffee brownie. The portions were large and filling. The taste was good. The restaurant's interior is modern, and the breakfast options are plentiful, and the food is quite tasty. The menu includes: 1. Egg station, beef bacon, mixed vegetables, sausage, Padang omelet, steamed fish, beans 2. Mushrooms, beef Bolognese, potatoes, pasta, pancakes, waffles, pukis, muffins, and toast 3. Mantau, wontons, fish fingers, dim sum, chicken terik, Indian food, salad 4. Indomie corner, noodle corner, ketoprak, yellow rice, porridge, and rujak-style chicken 5. Ika dabu-dabu, baby kailan, salted fish fried rice, pastries, donuts, and bread 6. Cereal, gluten-free, fruit, juice, and smoothies"
"40.","Teri Boswell","5","2025-05-31","5","This Sheraton hotel provided a surprisingly pleasurable experience during my two separate one-night stays in the last 2 weeks. Despite its proximity to CGK, it’s surprisingly quiet, clean, spacious, and has a beautiful pool, gym, and excellent restaurant. Several of the concierge and restaurant staff even remembered me when I returned two weeks later, even though I had only been there once before. The breakfast buffet offers western and Indonesian options, and the restaurant supervisor, Mr. Devin, ensured my meals were to my liking. The supervisors’ active engagement with guests demonstrates expectations, resulting in exceptional service. This hotel is in my top 5% of travel experiences."
"41.","Brandon Enow","6","2025-12-24","5","Dila and vivi were so amazing during my time in the hotel I don’t have words to disturb how nice and caring and affectionate they were with me and my colleagues"
"42.","Danny Kusnardi","4","2025-08-31","5","Conviniently closed to the airport. Room was clean and the service was superb starting from the pick up from airport until check out. Breakfast was really food. A good variety of western, asian and Indonesian food."
"43.","Mei Hui","1","2025-10-01","5","I stayed only a few days here, all the staff were nice, the cleanliness was also good. Thank you to Shimar and Vivi for being so friendly, always offer help after serving deserves a good rating ❗️"
"44.","Christina Meisa","169","2025-05-31","5","Sheraton Airport Jakarta is an unexpectedly tranquil haven, perfect for a weekend staycation just outside the city. Despite being close to Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, the hotel feels worlds away—wrapped in tropical greenery and gentle elegance that instantly evokes Bali resort vibes. The pool is a standout feature, with serene surroundings that invite you to unwind completely. Whether you’re taking a dip or lounging with a book, it’s easy to slip into vacation mode. The rooms are spacious, modern, and quiet, offering a restful retreat with plush bedding and thoughtful amenities. A unique highlight is the jogging track, where guests can spot aircraft gracefully taking off and gliding in for landing. It’s not a direct runway view, but the experience of watching planes in motion against the wide sky adds a playful, almost cinematic touch to your morning walk or evening stroll. Service throughout the hotel is polished and friendly, and the on-site dining options cater to both international and local tastes. Whether you’re traveling solo, as a couple, or with family, Sheraton Airport Jakarta offers the perfect balance of convenience and calm. It’s a mini holiday without the travel fuss—an easy escape wrapped in tropical charm and aviation magic."
"45.","Nata","15","2025-05-01","5","Great stay for our layover in Jakarta. We took advantage of the excellent airport shuttle service offered free of charge to hotel guests. Rohmat, the airport representative, was very punctual and attentive. The shuttle was waiting for us the moment we got out of the Arrivals hall. As platinum members we got complimentary dinner service as well as breakfast. Hotel’s M Club is still under renovation. The food taste and quality were outstanding. The pool was very good as well as the pool’s bar where we got some cold local beers. The bed was very comfortable and contributed significantly to us having no jet lag. Highly recommend for Jakarta airport."

"49.","M7 P7","10","2025-08-31","2","Photos on website clearly enhanced. Property does not look nearly that good in real life. Also made us wait until exactly 3 pm despite requesting early check-in. Will try a different airport property next time."
"50.","JKT Food Squad","3","2024-12-31","5","Our staying experience at Sheraton Jakarta Airport is very pleasant. This reopen hotel keeps its signature Bali vibes design and structure, while adding some modern touch on some part of the building. The overall building is not too high, but very huge with left and right wings. The lobby is spacious with tons of seating area, so your waiting is comfortable. Also, perfect for remote working since they provide chargers and plugs. This hotel provide amazing view for aviation enthusiast with close look to airport runway. Besides, you can chill, relax and zone out while looking for the lake view. Our room is the Deluxe King Room Terrace Lake View - so cozy, spacious, direct access to the view of the lake. The amenities are very comprehensive. And the best part is, eventho located nearby the airport, it's not noisy at all. The foods are also great, the staffs are incredibly friendly, the pool is perfect for sunbathing and it was a great short escape after all. And no worries, it's family & kids friendly hotel!"
"51.","Junivia Krisciptyani","6","2025-07-01","5","Semua staffnya helpful dan ramah2. Di dalam Playground disediakan Snack and drinks buat anak, jadi makin betah. Di bagian belakang, ada kolam ikan (bisa minta makanan di front office), kelinci, kura2 dan burung. Plus kalo beruntung, bisa liat landasan pesawat dari dalam kamar. Anak-anak gak akan bosen. Makanannya enak dan bervariasi. Pertahankan! Lokasi sangat dekat dari Bandara Soekarno Hatta 👍"
"52.","Victor Daniel","18","2024-12-31","5","I recently stayed at the Sheraton Jakarta Airport, and it was an excellent experience. The hotel is conveniently located just minutes from the airport, making it perfect for travelers. The rooms were spacious, clean, and beautifully designed, providing a comfortable retreat after a long journey. The swimming pool give you Bali vibes. The staff was exceptionally friendly and accommodating. They also provide shuttle service, which made getting to and from the airport a breeze. The on-site dining options offered a great variety of delicious food, and the breakfast buffet was a highlight, featuring both local and international dishes. Overall, I highly recommend the Sheraton Jakarta Airport for anyone looking for a convenient and comfortable stay near the airport. I’ll definitely return on my next trip!"
"53.","Jounky Ardyan","7","2025-05-01","4","Our two-night stay at Sheraton Bandara was a truly relaxing experience. From the moment we arrived, the warm hospitality made us feel right at home. The peaceful atmosphere, well-appointed rooms, and attentive service created the perfect getaway. The staff went above and beyond to ensure our comfort, making our stay both seamless and memorable. It wasn’t just a hotel stay—it felt like a home away from home. Looking forward to our next visit!"
"54.","BG Berlin","237","2025-03-31","3","The name Sheraton doesn't mean automatically 5 Star's. For me it's not better than 3.5. After reviewing agai I will take .5 of Star away, leaving 3 Stars only. Started badly with complimentary shuttle Limousine pick up from Airport. To catch the shuttle one has to walk a Kilometer in 32 degree heat with all the luggage, not advisable for the elderly. Reaching this shuttle station we were told to walk a further 400 m to the Limousine. We refused and the driver organized a taxi which we had to pay for. Upon arrival one was told that the room will not be ready for 1 more hour. Only upon complaining a room was made available within 10 minutes. Entering the room ones got a damp smell...Shower and toilet are old fashioned. I have stayed in 3 Star hotel's with automatic toilets."

"59.","Diaz Miguel","404","2025-05-01","3","This hotel, in my opinion, is NOT friendly at all for guests bringing their own vehicles, whether cars or motorcycles. Their target demographic seems to be travelers heading to the airport or in transit, who likely won't have personal transportation (they do offer a free airport shuttle). The parking area for vehicles (both cars and motorcycles) is located a significant 250 meters away from the hotel lobby. This entire 250-meter stretch is outdoors, meaning if it's raining, you'll get wet walking from the parking lot to the lobby or your hotel room. The parking lot itself is also outdoors, and the walk to the lobby is entirely uncovered. The only other option is valet parking, which incurs an additional fee of IDR 100,000 if you want to avoid the walk. Furthermore, to drive from the parking area to the hotel lobby, you have to take a roundabout route of 2.4 kilometers. During peak hours, this can easily take 10-15 minutes due to the one-way street in front of the hotel. This hotel is definitely not suitable if you are traveling with your own vehicle. On a positive note, the rooms have been recently renovated and are very nice, especially the Suite room I stayed in. The Suite room is incredibly spacious, featuring a living room, dining area, another living space, and even a kitchen area with a two-door refrigerator. However, there didn't appear to be a stove. There are two bathrooms; the one near the entrance only has a toilet. The main bathroom, located within the bedroom, has both a shower and a bathtub. The TVs in the living room and bedroom are both very large. However, the breakfast, in my opinion, was very standard, even bordering on lacking for a 5-star hotel. Many other 5-star hotels offer a breakfast experience that is far superior in terms of variety, menu options, and the friendliness of the breakfast staff. The car park also only had about 3 cars (very few for a 5-star hotel parking lot), while the motorcycle parking was full. So, in my opinion, this hotel is very suitable for transit passengers and those without their own vehicles. If you have a car or motorcycle, I would recommend staying at one of the many other hotels in the airport area. Thank you."

Resto nya enak, tapi belum ada lounge nya. Also kafe yang di dalem hotel juga enak-enak makanannya. Karena hotelnya agak jauh dari tempat makan lain ya. Tp ok banget misal ada transit di Jakarta tp ga mau nyari hotel di tengah kota yg agak jauh."
"61.","Ian Macniven","30","2024-12-31","5","We had a fantastic 2 night stay at the Sheraton. The overall experience was excellent. The staff are some of the best we have encountered in all our hotel stays. Every member of staff we Interacted with was ultra professional, helpful, friendly and went out of their way to make sure we had the best stay possible. They are a credit to the Hotel and we cannot thank them enough. The hotel,although a number of years old, has been renovated very nicely and rooms are large, comfortable and well equipped. The pool area and grounds are beautiful. Breakfast was great and offered a large choice of quality options to suit most tastes. We also ate in the Daily Social Restaurant and the quality of the food and service were impeccable. On more than one occasion, in multiple areas, the service went above and beyond what we expected and we would highly recommend a stay at the Sheraton Bandara Soekarno Hatta...p.s. if you are an aviation enthusiast the proximity to the taxi ways at T3 offer an amazing view of the aircraft."

Airport shuttle complimentary. Food quality and breakfast also worth the dime. Gym is nothing though, but there’s a few hundred meters of bike path, which is perfect for a stroll or stretch after/before the flight."
"63.","Nurul","110","2025-03-31","5","Sudah kedua kalinya stay di hotel ini. Pertama tahun 2024 lalu, tapi cuma semalem aja. Untuk tahun ini ada kesempatan stay untuk 1 minggu di hotel ini. Saya ke sini bersama Ibu mertua dan suami. Kami pesan 2 kamar Delux dengan Garden View.. saya lupa video/foto kamarnya. Tapi sesuai dengan yang ada di website. Fasilitas kamarnya juga ok, seperti hotel 5 star pada umumnya. Ditambah, pelayanannya ramah sekali. Setiap bertemu petugas selalu di sapa. Selain itu, kolam renang nya cukup luas. Tapi benar2 di outdoor banget... alias in the center of the building, where it's closed to the cafe and restaurant, introvert must be related. Untuk restaurannya best sekali!! Kami pesan kamar yang include breakfast jadi setiap pagi selalu ke resto nya.. anyway, makannya enak2 tidak ada yang zonk!! Ada room service jugaaaa dan enak juga makanannyaa. Kami pesan hotel di hotel ini karena strategis dekat sekali dengan bandara. Ada shuttle bus nya juga dan itu selalu ada setiap 1 jam, and it's free. Pokoknya saya menikmati dan senang stay di sini. Recommended 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽"

"65.","Mario Delpon","4","2025-01-31","5","The hotel meets 200% expectations, it is spectacular in all aspects, rooms, services, guest service, restaurant, swimming pool... But I want to especially highlight the attention that two people in particular, Cinta and Diana, gave us in their restaurant. Super friendly and attentive at all times with us, for me it has been a spectacularly special memory, without hesitation I will recommend coming to the hotel to anyone who knows and visits Indonesia, and of course I myself will repeat!"
"66.","Coffee Thrills","20","2024-12-31","5","I had one of the best resort hotel experiences ever, with a lovely ambience, cozy room, and super friendly staff; the divine food made it even better! The public coffee shop is perfect for afternoon tea with friends and family. We loved it so much that we returned before our early flight to Bali, enjoying the newly designed interior that truly feels like a mini getaway to Bali, ideal for a family staycation. We got a lakeside room, which has the best view in the morning. And also the jogging track is very convenient, jog by the lake is the perfect way to start the day. Overall, very great experience, I would love to visit again and bring my family to comewith."

We got the room with the terrace/balcony and it was very spacious my only comment is because it was next to a river there were many bugs and insects on the terrace so we couldnt really sit and some even got into the room so take that into account if you want to book this type of room but other than that i loved the hotel their breakfast was nice so much variety, the service was immaculate and the shuttle to the airport was quick and hassle free"
"70.","hape cadangan","7","2025-05-01","4","Sheraton mencerminkan sebuah nama bintang lima. Namun sayang, terdapat sejumlah hal detail yang perlu diperhatikan. Saat check in, tidak ada suguhan welcome drink, apalagi welcome snack. Kamar kami mendapatkan teras yang becek karena saluran air bermasalah pasca hujan. Fasilitas untuk anak ala kadarnya, tidak ada yang benar-benar serius di sana. Menu sarapan kurang variatif. Meskipun demikian, pelayanan hotel ini sangat baik, khususnya para staf hotelnya."

Dari awal hingga akhir, semuanya benar-benar luar biasa. Anak saya bahkan mendapat kejutan manis berupa es krim dan kue di malam hari, lalu pagi harinya disambut lagi dengan kejutan lainnya—benar-benar membuatnya senang dan merasa spesial! Walau kamar kami berada persis di sebelah runway, kualitas arsitektur dan desain akustiknya sangat mengagumkan. Kami tidur dengan sangat nyaman tanpa mendengar suara pesawat sama sekali. Tempat tidurnya super nyaman, membuat istirahat jadi maksimal. Pelayanannya juga bintang lima—ramah, cepat, dan penuh perhatian terhadap detail. Saya sangat merekomendasikan Sheraton Bandara, terutama bagi yang mencari kenyamanan premium sebelum atau sesudah penerbangan. Akan kembali lagi tanpa ragu!"
"74.","Charles PITON","18","2024-12-31","5","One of the best airport hotel! The hotel itself is stunning, heritage building, beautiful and serene lobby, outstanding and large gardens. A pleasure to wake up and have some walks and runs around the gardens and multiple ponds. Titanium member: we received an upgrade to a beautiful one bedroom suite on top floor. Very quiet and comfortable. Club lounge benefits are outstanding. A La carte menu for the evening. And drinks available throughout the day at request. The club lounge itself is also very lovely and pleasant to stay. Breakfast is also outstanding with various choices we don't see at other similar properties in Indonesia. The service was also very good and professional, without being intrusive. On the downside, the airport shuttle system and service needs serious improvement. Few shuttle times and not yet well coordinated. The fitness offering could be a bit bigger as well. Overall, it is surely one of the best and relaxing airport hotel we have been to. We felt the standards of the hotel to be closer to JW Marriott than Sheraton in many areas."

"77.","Genta","1457","2024-12-31","5","Sheraton Jakarta Soekarno Hatta Airport is a refreshing gem and the only 5-star hotel in the airport area. Its sprawling property features a big resort-style pool, serene courtyards, koi ponds, and lush gardens with a lake view. It’s not just a transit hotel—it’s a serene escape from bustling Jakarta and even works wonderfully as a holiday destination. I stayed in their Deluxe Guest Room, 1 King, Terrace, which opened onto a private terrace overlooking the lush gardens and lake. The setting was incredibly tranquil, surrounded by big trees and blooming flowers. Since the property has been newly renovated and reopened, the décor and furniture felt fresh and brand new! The bed was super comfortable, with high-quality linens ensuring a perfect night’s sleep. Food here was a highlight too! The breakfast spread at Daily Social was excellent, with a mix of Indonesian, Western, and Asian options. I also had their festive Christmas dinner, which featured a special menu including fresh seafood on ice and delicious beef brisket. Their &More by Sheraton café was perfect for teatime, offering a great selection of sweet and savory pastries, cakes, and hot tea, all enjoyed with stunning views of the pool and lake. For drinks, the Unspoken Bar provided a cozy and intimate vibe. Fitness enthusiasts will love the gym—it’s well-equipped and in excellent condition. I had a few great workout sessions there. Families are well-catered to as well, with a large kids’ pool complete with fun toys. Overall, this hotel is truly recommended for both transit travelers and those seeking a peaceful getaway. It’s perfect for families, couples, or even solo travelers looking for a refreshing retreat close to the airport!"
"78.","Pilates Peniche","2","2024-12-31","5","Stunning hotel with fantastic facilities (the gym is the best I've seen at a hotel in a long time), the pool has you feeling as if you are in a tropical resort. The room was super comfortable, impecably prepared and had everything you could wish for. The staff deserve special mention, everyone was incredibly welcoming and took time to say hello and make sure we had everything we needed. We were only staying for a night between flights and I wish it would've been longer."
"79.","Freddy Mason","56","2024-12-31","1","Sorry but this hotel is ridiculous. When you book an airport hotel you want convenience and quick check-in without problems. Check in to my room and there is a huge cockroach in the shower. 🪳 Staff come after waiting ages to kill it with sprat, and I request a room change as I really hate cockroaches. I stand outside my room for about 15 minutes and nothing was done to move my room. I go to reception to complain and I was told they were getting the room ready, which was obviously not true. Directions to the pickup transfer were not clear but driver was very nice. Waited 20 minutes for a delayed passenger. Would've been easier to get grab. Finally it's 11pm and the room next door is blaring the TV. I rang reception and was told they can give me earplugs. Won't be back."

No shops nearby. But quite easy to order & get food delivered. Overall, it was an enjoyable stay."
"81.","M","208","2025-01-31","5","Felt like a proper 5 star hotel not just airport hotel, a very pleasant surprise. My trip and mood was ruined by the flight issue and it really made a difference having a good time here since I was stuck in Jakarta for a day anyway. Rooms have everything you would expect at a 5 star except for a bathtub and nespresso coffee machine but they have local coffee bags which is as nice and more sustainable and it’s a nice touch, tea as well. Generous with water (happy about it). Gym was a nice surprise too, super clean and new. Citrus water, cooler, very very clean. Doesn’t have much, only dumbbells and about 6 cardio machines but enough space for a proper cardio/full body workout using benches and dumbbells. Coffee is good and resto has vegan and vegetarian options. I’d like to highlight the staff’s attitude, everyone was awfully polite and helpful, very personal and accommodating, I’d say not all 5 star hotels have this staff. I felt like I was on holiday again even though my actual holiday was affected and I had to stop in Jakarta. Thank you!"
"82.","Ratna Citra Nabila","2","2024-12-31","5","Our flight was delayed so we decided to find a hotel to rest for a while because we had a baby with us but was pleasantly surprised by the amicable service provided and the cleanliness of the room. The atmosphere and the scenery of the hotel are very nice; lots of greenery and shade, along with a nice walkway near the lake. We mentioned in passing as we checked in that it was our baby birthday recently and got a cake for him sent to our room. Overall it was a 10/10 experience and we wished we had more time to stay. Will definitely come back!"

Vibes-nya seperti di Bali dengan suasana resort yang asri, lengkap dengan pepohonan dan kolam renang outdoor yang bikin betah. Kamarnya bagus, modern, dan bersih, plus sentuhan vintage dari renovasi baru bikin pengalaman menginap jadi memorable. Meski bangunannya lama, hotel ini tetap punya kesan fresh dengan kombinasi desain minimalis yang elegan setelah renovasi dan grand Opening di bulan Mei 2024 lalu. Nice! Staff-nya juga super ramah dan helpful dari awal sampai akhir. Makanan di pool deck? Top! Cobain deh Duo Sate Bakar dan Caesar Salad yang light tapi flavorful banget. Kita juga sempet cobain BBQ Buffet night di restoran Daily Social available Sabtu malam—perfect buat santai sambil menikmati aneka daging dan seafood! The only five-star hotel di area bandara ini bener-bener worth it buat quick getaway!"
"84.","Pingkan Putripradita","13","2025-01-31","5","A Hidden Gem for a Perfect Staycation I recently stayed here for a casual staycation, and I must say, this has been my best experience so far. The ambiance is exceptional, it truly feels like a serene Bali resort amidst the bustling Jakarta city. The hotel’s newly renovated rooms and facilities exude a modern yet warm vibe, reflecting the impeccable standards Sheraton is known for. I was fortunate to get a room with a spectacular view overlooking the Soekarno-Hatta runway. Watching planes take off and land up close was a unique experience, and thanks to the double-glass windows, there was absolutely no noise, just a theater-like view to enjoy in peace. The highlight of my stay was the exceptional hospitality. The staff were incredibly friendly, professional, and attentive. A special thanks to Ms. Ni Wayan Sovi (Mbak Sovi), the Front Office Manager, whose warm and welcoming demeanor truly made the experience memorable. The housekeeping and F&B teams also deserve praise for their outstanding service. This hidden gem is highly recommended, and I look forward to returning soon."

"87.","Chrysogonus Siddha Malilang","42","2024-12-31","5","The hotel was not my first choice, since the hotel inside Terminal 3 was fully booked. Some friends even warned me that the hotel might be spooky because it was abandoned for couple of years. My experience? Total opposite!! I was pampered as soon as I entered the lobby. The room was very spacious and cozy. The service made me feel like a king. Too bad I didn’t bring my swimming trunk so I couldn’t enjoy the pool. Should I need another airport transit in the future, this hotel will be on top of my list."

"91.","Andy Lee","82","2024-12-31","5","I recently completed my second stay at Sheraton Bandara Jakarta Soekarno-Hatta, and once again, I was thoroughly impressed. My first experience here, during the soft opening on July 4th, was already perfect. However, this time, I want to focus more on my second stay. I was warmly welcomed by Aileen at the front office, and I had the opportunity to chat with Sophie, the very experienced Front Office Manager, about Marriott's hotel network. Initially, everything went smoothly until I discovered a leak in room 1112. I immediately contacted the front office, and Alitha, who was on duty, handled my complaint very professionally. Without hesitation, she moved me to room 1117 and, in recognition of my Platinum Membership status, even upgraded my room to a Suite. The Suite felt just as impressive as the room I stayed in during my first visit. The service at Unspoken Bar was also commendable. The staff was very prompt, quick, and efficient. The food offered during breakfast and through the complimentary membership was delicious, adding to the positive impression of my stay. I particularly enjoyed the hotel's theme, which evokes the relaxing atmosphere of Bali, providing a sense of calm amidst the city's hustle and bustle. I would also like to express my gratitude to all the staff who assisted me, even though I may have forgotten some of their names. They were all very friendly and ready to help with anything I needed. I hope Sheraton Bandara Jakarta continues to grow and maintains this exceptional level of hospitality. I am eagerly looking forward to my next visit!"

The breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, and the BBQ AYCE dinner were amazing. The location of this hotel is great within Soekarno Hatta Airport area.

"99.","Pig S","155","2024-12-31","4","Coming to this hotel from the airport was a bit farther than it looks w numerous dark and winding streets. So glad I wasnt driving. It was a bit strange that checking in after midnight because of flight delayed. The front desk gentleman mentioned that he would upgrade my room probably because of the bonvoy membership. So last minute, he decided to bring me to the regular room rather than the suite upgrade on the upper level. So he just helped me w my luggage to the 2nd level which was the same level as the lobby. I was very puzzled that why he would bring up the upgrade then ended up not. Very strange there. House keeping upstairs was making a lot of noises in the morning. It was like doing some renovation. The exterior hallway of the rooms was airy. It was nice to experience this even it is in the city of Jakarta. The pool loungers could use some cleaning. The cushions werent appealing. Swimming is large. Quiet and sunny. Poolside bar could up the game a little. Menu is hard to read. Coffee is 1 out of 5 in rating. Restaurant is popular with many guests. It serves the same menu as the in room dining. I didn’t like the dishes I ordered in the morning. So I don’t feel that money was well spent there. Courteous concierge team. Expansive line of staff. And helpful. Restaurant staff were nice too. Food service speed wasn’t up to par though. Bed was quite comfortable. Didn’t particularly like the down pillows and the blanket. It gets too warm personally. But temperature control inside the room is 10/10. Feels clean and cool with auto adjustments which is very appreciative without getting too dry!!! The room reminds me of the Marriott hotel in Bali Laguna. It’s really nice there. Food as well."

Arem² nya tasteless dan pero. Jalan ke meeting room nya jauh banget, belum lagi soal parkirannya yg bikin bingung krn ga ada info parkirnya dmn. Makan siangnya oke lah meski gak exceptional bgt."
"114.","Johnny Tran","12","2024-12-31","5","Recently renovated and reopened in March, we had a wonderful stay with an incredibly delicious buffet breakfast. We checked in late and wanted to stay close to the airport and had a 8pm swim in the heated massive pool. Could not hear the plane above in the evening or during the day inside, the bed and pillows were super comfortable and we slept through uninterrupted, awoke full of energy to smash out two hours in the hotel gym and recovered afterwards into the pool. Each staff were so welcoming, attentive and always smiling, delivering a memorable stay that went above and beyond our expectations. We shall not be staying anywhere else when in Jakarta regardless of how far we are to the main centre which is 30 mins away. Thank you so much to the team from the front desk to the barista (Sidiq) that brew the perfect coffee. Johnny and Michelle"

I was travelling alone and I find that they take a good attention at the public spaces too (good fit for working while you're on vacation). The room is super clean! I love the greeneries that surrounds the hotel and the nature sounds too! The warmth of the staffs from check in until my departure from the hotel is top notch. It is totally worth it!"

Dari persiapan meeting, support dari Bapak Hendrik Simanjuntak sangat baik. Beliau sangat support untuk memenuhi kebutuhan acara saya. Saya diberikan ruangan terbaik mengingat pentingnya Acara saya. Sampai pada saat saya check in sampai dengan cek ruangan meeting Front Office, Pak Agung Priambodo & Rizqi Pangestu (tim teknis/PIC Ruangan) juga turut support memastikan kamar dan ruangan saya sesuai dengan kebutuhan saya. Takjub juga untuk laundry servicenya cepat dan bersih Untuk vibenya juga asik serasa di Bali yaa Oh ya, yang saya kira karena dekat banget dengan runway pesawat akan ribut suara pesawat ternyata dikamar sangat sunyi. Overall saya puas terhadap service dari staff yang tidak bisa saya sebutkan satu persatu. Semuanya cekatan, gercep, tanggung jawab The best laaah ❤️❤️❤️"

Was checked in by Talitha the front desk associate who patiently and clearly briefed me through on all the amenities, benefits and services offered by the hotel. Elisa (or Elsa) another associate brought me to the suite and pointed out the controls, room service, gym location etc. New hotel but with a very seasonsed team of hospitality staff. Loving the urban resort concept. The hotel provides an hourly shuttle service to CKG airport which is just a 7 mins ride away. The physical lounge is not ready yet but usual lounge service (breakfast, evening cocktails, full meal serving etc) is being offered at the onsite &More. Gym is well equipped and spacious. This particular suite room doesn’t have a bathtub. Hotel is not able to hold deposit at this moment so room payment is done during check in, and payment on the spot for all other services. 10/10 will recommend especially those transiting through Jakarta airport. Definitely better than the Fairfield nearby which I stayed in Feb 2024."

"138.","Yadi Yasin","264","2024-12-31","5","Hotel Sheraton ini skrg kembali masuk dalam grup Marriot setelah bbrp tahun diambil oleh manajemennya Accors. Dulu, sejak tahun 1990an akhir dibawah SPG/Starwood Preferred Guest dgn nama Sheraton Bandara. Dr dulu sering menginap disinindr sejak tahun 2000an namun berhenti sejak tdk lagi dalam hotel chain SPG, yg skrg Marriot. Sekarang dgn manajemen Marriot baru hotel di renovasi total, baru selesai sebagian bulan Maret 2024 lalu, tp sdh accept guest. Kamar2 dgn desain interior jadul sdh menjadi modern minimalis. Pool juga di renovasi, dulu pancuran air dr patung kura2 dikolam utama, skrg menjadi patung lumba2 dikolam anak. Ada tambahan 1 pool lagi. Total 3 pool. Spa belum di buka. Jogging track juga belum semua, krn right wing masih dalam proses renovasi. Hotel Sheraton Jakarta Soeta menjadi fresh kembali, dan kembali menjadi fav saya utk stay disini. Oia, Manajemen/receptionist/cheff juga recognize saya sebegai Gold Elite Lifetime Member Marriot Bonvoy. 2 thumbs up 👍🏻👍🏻"

Stafnya luar biasa—penuh perhatian, membantu, dan sopan tanpa mengganggu sama sekali. Namun, hotel ini memiliki satu masalah besar: dua kamar pertama yang kami tempati berbau jamur begitu parah sehingga saya langsung merasakan gejala sakit. Kami kemudian dipindahkan ke lantai empat, di mana bau jamur dan lumut hanya berasal dari AC. Kamarnya bersih tanpa noda dan sebagian besar bebas jamur. Namun, bagian lain hotel, terutama kamar di lantai dasar, memiliki masalah jamur yang signifikan. Siapa pun yang memiliki masalah kesehatan sebaiknya menghindari menginap di hotel ini. Jamur disebarkan ke seluruh kamar oleh sistem AC. Saya tidak bisa tidur sama sekali."
"277.","Paul Gebauer","78","2025-12-01","4","Hotel besar di sebelah bandara. Layanan antar-jemput tersedia melalui bus antar-jemput gratis atau limusin hotel berbayar.

Sarapannya berlimpah, dengan buah dan jus yang lezat! Anda tidak akan salah memilih hotel ini."
"279.","ou s","365","2025-08-31","5","Saya memesan tiket pesawat ke Bali melalui Jakarta, tetapi penerbangan saya dibatalkan tak lama setelah pemesanan, jadi saya akhirnya menginap di hotel dekat bandara. Mereka menawarkan shuttle bus gratis. Bus ini melayani rute domestik. Saya memesan tiket pesawat ke sana, tetapi antrean panjang untuk mendapatkan visa setelah kedatangan sangat menyita waktu, jadi saya akhirnya naik taksi Bluebird. Harganya hampir 5.000 yen, meskipun tampaknya cukup mahal. Grab juga sekitar 3.500 yen, jadi mungkin keberangkatan dari bandara cukup mahal, atau mungkin karena waktu keberangkatan yang kurang tepat. Makan malam tersedia di restoran atau bar kolam renang. Tidak ada lounge. Sarapan prasmanannya lezat. Saya menggunakan shuttle bandara gratis setelah check-out. Secara keseluruhan, saya sangat puas."

Makanan di restorannya lezat, dan stafnya ramah dan penuh perhatian, sehingga membuat pengalaman menginap saya nyaman. Roti dan camilan tersedia untuk dibeli, yang sepertinya merupakan pilihan yang baik untuk dimakan di kamar Anda. Staf mengatakan kepada saya bahwa karena sangat dekat dengan bandara, mereka tidak dapat membangunnya di lantai yang lebih tinggi. Berkat hal ini, bangunannya memiliki suasana tropis 🏝️, menjadikannya tempat menginap yang nyaman seperti hotel. Ada juga bus antar-jemput dari bandara, yang sangat praktis. Anda dapat menggunakan bus antar-jemput terlebih dahulu melalui what's-sup, jadi tidak perlu khawatir."
"286.","Y nis","55","2025-01-31","5","Saya check-in sebelum tengah hari dan check-out pukul 4:00 pagi karena harus pindah dari Terminal Domestik T3 ke Terminal Internasional T3. Sebagaimana tercantum di situs web hotel, bus antar-jemput memerlukan reservasi terlebih dahulu. Saya menghubungi pihak hotel dan menerima balasan yang jelas melalui email dan WhatsApp mengenai halte bus antar-jemput. Bus tersebut ternyata beroperasi sekitar satu jam sekali. Setelah mendarat, saya menerima pesan WhatsApp yang tepat waktu, sehingga saya dapat dengan mudah menemukan staf untuk menyambut saya. Kamar telah direnovasi dan sangat nyaman. Tidak ada bathtub. Sayangnya, Sheraton Club sedang dalam renovasi dan tidak tersedia. Hal ini akan diumumkan di situs web. Namun, sebagai anggota Bonvoy Platinum, saya dapat menikmati minuman di kafe dan beberapa camilan pilihan antara pukul 5:00 sore dan 7:00 malam. Fasilitas bersama yang tersedia terdiri dari restoran yang terang, kafe, kolam renang besar, dan pusat kebugaran. Tidak ada fasilitas spa atau pijat. Tidak ada minimarket, jadi sebaiknya beli kebutuhan kecil di minimarket di sebelah halte bus antar-jemput. Saya makan siang di restoran, dan rasanya lezat. Semua staf hotel sangat ramah, dan meskipun kunjungan singkat, perjalanan saya berakhir dengan menyenangkan."

"292.","Eduardo Jiménez","65","2024-12-31","5","Dalam pencarian saya untuk hotel dekat bandara Jakarta untuk menginap singkat di antara penerbangan, saya sangat senang menemukan bahwa Hotel Sheraton Bandara telah dibuka kembali setelah beberapa tahun tutup. Tanpa ragu, saya langsung memesan lagi. Saya pertama kali mengunjungi hotel ini lima belas tahun yang lalu selama perjalanan bisnis pertama saya ke Indonesia. Itu adalah cinta pada pandangan pertama: sebuah oase sejati di tengah hiruk pikuk lalu lintas kota. Areanya yang luas, kolam renang yang besar, dan kamar-kamar yang luar biasa, yang kini telah direnovasi, meninggalkan kesan yang tak terlupakan. Namun di luar fasilitasnya, yang benar-benar menonjol adalah staf hotel. Setiap anggota staf profesional dan ramah, selalu siap membuat masa menginap Anda senyaman mungkin. Saya ingin menyampaikan rasa terima kasih saya yang tulus kepada seluruh tim Sheraton Bandara, mulai dari manajer, Bapak Rizal Afandi, hingga pengemudi bus antar-jemput, dan terutama kepada Gita, Hanna, dan semua orang lain yang telah memberikan sambutan hangat kepada saya. Saya berharap dapat segera kembali pada penerbangan lanjutan saya berikutnya di Jakarta. --------------------------------------------- Dalam pencarian saya akan hotel yang dekat dengan bandara Jakarta, untuk singgah sebentar di antara penerbangan, sangat menyenangkan mengetahui bahwa Hotel Sheraton Bandara telah dibuka kembali untuk umum setelah berapa tahun ditutup. Saya tidak berpikir dua kali dan segera memesan kembali. Saya memperkenalkan hotel ini lima belas tahun yang lalu, saat perjalanan bisnis pertama saya ke Indonesia. Itu adalah tape pada pandangan pertama: sebuah oasis sejati di tenerh lalu lintas kota yang kacau. Ruang yang luas, kolam renang yang megah, dan kamar-kamar yang luar biasa, yang kini telah hancur, meninggalkan kesan yang tak terlupakan. Namun lebih dari sekedar fasilitasnya, yang benar-benar menonjol adalah staf hotel. Tanpa kecuali, mereka semua profesional dan ramah, selalu siap untuk membuat masa menginap menjadi sebaik mungkin. Saya ingin mengucapkan terima kasih sebesar-besarnya kepada seluruh tim Sheraton Bandara, mulai dari manajer, Bapak Rizal Afandi, hingga sopir Shuttle Bus, dan terutama kepada Gita, Hanna, dan semua yang telah memberikan Berbagai hangat. Saya berharap dapat segera kembali pada koneksi penerbangan saya berikutnya di Jakarta."

Mereka bahkan mengambilkan obat untuk kami dari apotek. Sarapan benar-benar luar biasa – lebih seperti brunch. Namun, untuk memenuhi namanya, masih ada ruang untuk perbaikan, terutama mengenai prosedur dan komunikasi. Jam buka yang diiklankan terus berubah. Misalnya, bar diiklankan buka hingga tengah malam, tetapi sudah tutup pukul 22:45. Beberapa staf restoran hampir tidak bisa berbahasa Inggris. Baterai di brankas kamar kami mati saat kami tiba. Dan proses pembayarannya aneh: Saat tiba, resepsionis memberi tahu kami bahwa semua pembelian akan dibebankan ke kamar kami. Tetapi kemudian di restoran, kami diberitahu bahwa kami belum meninggalkan deposit dan oleh karena itu harus membayar langsung. Tidak satu pun dari hal-hal ini merupakan masalah besar, tetapi secara keseluruhan, hal itu memberi kesan bahwa masih ada pelatihan dan perbaikan yang dibutuhkan untuk memenuhi standar yang diharapkan."
