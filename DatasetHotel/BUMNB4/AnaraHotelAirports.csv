"1.","J.","220","2025-12-10","5","Anara Airport Hotel is an excellent choice if you need a place directly at Jakarta Airport — you can reach it easily on foot, which is incredibly convenient after a long flight. The hotel is modern, clean, and very well organized. If you’re planning to explore the city, you should stay somewhere more central, as this location is purely ideal for airport convenience. But as an airport hotel, it’s absolutely perfect. The breakfast buffet is very extensive, with a wide selection of dishes — everyone will find something they like. I highly recommend it for a comfortable and stress-free stay near the airport."
"2.","John Price","142","2025-12-17","2","This hotel would be excellent but for a few important issues: 1) the Android room TV was the most unnecessarily complicated and user-UNfriendly of any that I have ever attempted to use. We had the technician come to our room and even he struggled to get it to work. BTW, there are controls behind the TV surround/bezel, which hinges to the left. We had to open that to disconnect and kill the image when we wanted to sleep! Who designs these systems?! 2) then we decided to kill all the power to the room with the room-key switch but the emergency torch/flashlight did NOT work. I wonder what other hotel safety facilities are non-functional; management take note! 3) the room fridge was empty - a waste of space. There was nithing inside, not even water!? 4) the shower cubicle door opened inwards - a safey issue - but that did NOT stop water from covering the bathroom floor. However the staff were all very friendly and the breakfast buffet excellent, especially the bubur ayam (chicken rice congee). The location for the airport terminal 3 could not be better: an indoor direct walk to your gate, all air-conditioned."
"3.","Danny Kim","379","2025-12-01","5","Love this airport hotel. Anara airport international hotel is located in the International terminal 3...I believe there is another Anara Grand hotel which is located in Domestic terminal. Be sure which one you want to stay. Our international hotel was very clean and quiet. Would stay here again if we have early flights. Breakfast was provided from 2am which was great plus but don't expect too much...it was not well maintained but understandable since it was early in the morning."

"5.","Magdalena Sudarman","257","2025-10-01","5","I stayed at Anara Airport Hotel Jakarta and was genuinely impressed. The location is unbeatable—right by the terminals—so getting to flights is stress-free. The rooms are modern, spotless, and surprisingly quiet for an airport hotel, with super comfortable beds and great water pressure in the shower. Staff are friendly and efficient, making check-in and check-out quick. The on-site restaurant serves a solid variety of Indonesian and international dishes, perfect if you’re arriving late or leaving early. Overall, it’s one of the best airport hotels I’ve ever experienced and I’d happily stay here again."
"6.","Dian Arum Puspitasari","25","2025-12-01","5","Stayed here in December 2023 for a short transit before and after an international flight. At that time, the hotel direction signs from the arrival area were a bit unclear, but not sure if that’s already improved now. The room view was only of the parking lot and highway, but that’s fine since it was chosen by my office anyway. No complaints since it was just a quick stay. Nice standard breakfast."
"7.","denis calligaris","43","2025-12-10","1","I was supposed to spend a night in this hotel before taking a plane at 6am in the morning. Like the previous year, I asked the hotel staff to wake me up, they propose this service. They forgot to wake me, I missed my plane, I couldn’t leave the same day, I had to buy a ticket again with all my extra bagage, 270€, 315 US dollars, 5,2 million roupies They apologized and offered me a 4€ discount for the following night, lamentable!!!!! I strongly advise against this hotel. Other hotels are just outside the airport, they are easily accessible with a taxi which will not cost you much"
"8.","Ann Supatkitmongkhon","58","2025-10-01","3","5 stars for location : it's inside T3, on 1st Floor, the middle floor between Arrival and Departure. (Departures on 2nd FL, Arrival on Ground Floor) walk only a few minutes to/from hotel. Just follow the sign Hotel Bandara / airport hotel. There is a convention store near hotel. 3 stars for Service: quick check in/out, BUT when calling operator or room seevice or house keeping, nobody picked up the phone, I tried several times. Eventually I need to walk down to the front desk to speak to them. 3 stars for Room : it's spacious, decent room. But the water leaked out from shower door. After shower, the floor and towel was all wet. I saw many complaints about this on review, and it did happen to me too. There is no body lotion, no iron, but u can request for it. Towels in my bathroom were quite old. Food was no good. Better to walk to eat inside the terminal 3. Many restaurants, Starbucks, etc at T3."
"9.","Ginaginagina Gina","185","2025-12-01","4","Setelah beberapa kali tidur disini. Kami baru mengalami yg namanya perbedaan service. Saat breakfast, bule2 ditawari minum kopi atau teh, kita cuma dilewati aja. Saya bukan gila hormat atau gila service, tapi bener2 loh kaya ga dianggap, dilihat juga ga. Kami mungkn ga keliatan apa gimana ya😆. Ya semoga kedepannya tidak ada yg mengalami hal ini. Kalau kamar, memang tetep nyaman. Makanan rasanya cukup aja, byk varian."
"10.","Fawzi M.","29","2025-10-31","4","Check-in was smooth, location was very convenient prior departure, friendly staff, clean room, tv had many options. Rooms should be better isolated, still a lot of sound from airplanes and the corridor. Breakfast had many options but was not the best, didn't look very fresh."
"11.","irien nadiar","432","2025-12-01","4","berada di dlm terminal 3, area keberangkatan di lt mezanine. Bila pakai kendaraan pribadi , naik ke lt 3 gedung parkir. Kami ke sini karena menjadi titik kumpul travel sebelum berangkat umroh. Restonya nyaman dan makanan lumayan"
"12.","jiim test-wp","48","2025-12-01","1","Udah 1x nginep di anara domestik dan 1x di internasional. Semua staf frontdesk kurang ajar, standar service di Jakarta. Untuk hospitality anara buruk sekali. Kasih saran kaya angin lewat, natap tamu kaya ga ada kerjaan, ngobrol sesama staf rajin cekatan, tolong tamu jadi diabaikan. Good workplace mungkin ya buat hangout, cuman customer yg bayar gajih mereka diabaikan."
"13.","Szymon Kadłuczka","135","2025-08-31","5","One of the most comfortable hotel beds we have slept on! Maybe we’re biased having slept all over Indonesia for the last month, but hey, it was great! Shower gel and soap smell very nice. Overall, a great stay! One thing for the staff - if you don’t know opening hours of your facilities, please just say so, don’t make stuff up..:) We came around 8PM and when asked, we were told gym is closed and opens at 7AM. We looked and it was opened. Another person later told us it’s opened from 6AM till 10PM which was the case as we went for a run at 6 before our flight. Gym was the main reason we chose this hotel, so it would have been a bummer, but it worked out fine in the end:)"

"15.","Sisi Sherlie","1","2025-10-01","5","Tempatnya sangat bersih, wangi, AC dingin, staff nya ramah-ramah dan lokasinya strategis banget, cocok untuk menginap sebentar sambil menunggu flight selanjutnya. lokasi nya sangat mudah di temukan. Kalau landing dari International Flight tidak perlu keluar West Lobby bisa langsung naik elevator ke Lantai 1 dan cari petunjuk arah ke Office Airlines, jalan lurus langsung ada arah logo ke Anara. Kalau mau flight ke International juga mudah tinggal keluar dari lobby hotelnya lalu cari elevator di tengah naik ke Lantai 2 sudah langsung Departure Lounge."
"16.","Rose tian88","4","2025-10-31","1","Tidak rekomendasi masih banyak hotel yg security ber attitude baik, pelayanan staff terutama security-nya ketus , kami jamaah umroh sewa room dgn ketus nya mreka mengusir kami dilobby, pdhal kan Bs bilang baik2., pdhal kami juga bayar disana bukan numpang. Tolong ini harus di evaluasi kedepan, front office itu cermin didalamnya. Security gaya nya kek yg punya hotel aj,. Lebih punya attitude cleaning service di bandara yg ramah2 dan welcome."
"17.","era septiani","27","2025-10-31","5","Saya menginap disana karena lokasi strategis dekat dengan bandara spesial terminal 3 , kamar bersih , makanannya taste good , I extended the room karena flight sore . Pelayanannya baik , pertahankan keramahan kepada tamu baik itu local or foreigner . Terimakasih"
"18.","Carey Guan","7","2025-12-01","5","The hotel is located close to gate one at international terminal 3, it’s easy to get to the departure gate. We had a couple’s message at the hotel, Intan and Raya were great, it was so relaxing, makes our transit more enjoyable."
"19.","MW","128","2025-08-31","5","Terletak di Terminal 3 bandara Soetta, lokasi strategis untuk penumpang yang transit dan butuh bermalam di bandara. Kamar cukup luas, bersih, furniture msh baru, amenity lengkap, pegawai hotel ramah. Dekat dengan counter check in F Garuda domestik. Dekat hotel ada beberapa resto."
"20.","Englishbars","252","2025-08-31","4","This is a mid-level airport hotel. Nothing special but it is clean and does the job. Breakfast was an odd thing with a mix of food. I decided to have the corn. The capsule hotel isn't a real option for western folks. This is an ok hotel and access to T3 is a breeze. That is what you are paying for......T3 and comfortable enough."
"21.","Aulia Rahmadina","42","2025-10-01","5","Anara Airport Hotel Jakarta is super convenient, lokasi sangat strategis dekat sekali dengan terminal 3 bandara soetta. the room so comfortable, very clean, cocok untuk sebelum flight. service is good, lobby's very smell good 🥰❤️"
"22.","Steven Stiles","21","2025-10-01","4","A little bit of a musky smell in the entrance. The breakfast buffet was fun to try some different foods. Some of the foods weren’t very warm, they’d been sitting out for a while. Bathroom floor was extremely slippery. Thankfully no slips but we were constantly watching out. Would stay here again for a layover!"
"23.","Yvan A. Digon","258","2025-10-01","2","Good hotel, but it's disappointing that at the check out, I end up being accused of stealing... a pillow. I had to explain for a while that I don't steal pillow, and that it takes space to put it in a suitcase. It doesn't feel like in a premium hotel. I'm always careful not to steal anything, so it feels bitter to be accused of stealing... a pillow. A pillow."
"24.","Melza Putra","10","2025-07-31","5","My number one hotel to stay setiap kali kita transit. Sudah sangat sering kembali ke Anara karena memang hotelnya sangat nyaman, lokasi strategis, kamar nyaman, dan yang paling penting staffnya sangat sangat hands on. Especially Briant, terima kasih untuk service yang luar biasa. Kita landing tadi malam jam 8. Badan capek, jetlav dan super mengantuk tapi Briant kasi kita service dan hospitality terbaik. Well done!👌🏻"
"25.","Rizki Ayu Fitriani","3","2025-10-01","5","Kamar nya sangat bersih dan nyaman, pekerja nya juga ramah dan sopan, Massage nya dengan Duo Sejoli Ibu Intan dan Ibu Oli sangat menyenangkan dan memuaskan dan makanan nya enak sekali. 😊😁 Salam dari Kikiyanti dan Williyanto 😆"
"26.","imbul","115","2025-07-31","5","pertamanya agak bingung masuknya dari mana, soalnya letak lobby hotelnya itu masuk ke terminal 3 dulu (kalo ngga salah ya, lupa gw terminal brp😁). tp ternyata deket dr pintu terminal itu. ngga jauh. petugasnya ramah betul, semuanya. kita nanya apapun jawabnya ramah. nanya arah ke sini ke situ dikasih petunjuk dgn jelas. top markotop lah. lobby hotel ini luas, bagus & nyaman. gw kesini buat anter ortu mau pergi haji jadi di sini banyak jamaah haji yg akan berangkat. ohya di lobby hotelnya disediakan welcome drink. bebas ambil. & di sini wangi bgt. kaya wangi lemon gtu suka deh. kamarnya luas, nyaman. foto seadanya aja itu hehe. it's 9,2 out of 10"
"27.","Baguz Salim","7","2025-07-31","1","Pelayanan staff dan security ketus dan tidak ramah, ada acara di meeting room. Duduk di sofa loby hotel sambil rehat habis turun dari pesawat, harus jajan di Cafenya, kalau gak jajan akan di usir. Kalian pikir kami tidak bisa bayar makan minum di Cafe? sampaikan secara baik di awal, bukan seolah2 ngusir setelah duduk di sofa loby!!!! Hanya hotel ini yang buat pelangganya kesal, dan terngiang2 dengan bad service-nya. Hotel lain banyak yg jauh lebih baik."
"28.","Riska Ananda","6","2025-12-10","5","Thank you, Mr. Heru, for the excellent service. As a guest, I am very satisfied and would recommend Anara for accommodation. I wish Anara continued success and all the best to Mr. Heru."

After a long, tiring journey from the other side of the globe, and the need to catch another flight in the morning,.. this atmosphere of the hotel offered an oasis. Definitely recommend this hotel."
"31.","Sharon L","24","2025-10-01","5","For those having a layover or transit next day flight kinda person, this is really a convenient and excellent hotel where rooms come with breakfast included thay starts at 2am to 10am. Very accommodating to flights in the morning, and a 10mins on foot distance to either arrival or departure hall."
"32.","Christian Kusuma","32","2025-10-01","5","We arrived at midnight with my parent and the staff is super helpful to get us a good room in a super fast mode. Room is super comfortable and quiet even with the take off n landing area is next to our room. BFAST was ok , maybe coz it’s open from 2 Am and we come at 9 am . But the best thing is ICE CREAM for Bast . The kids loves it. Looking forward to stay here again when ever we have an early arrival or connecting flight ."

"40.","Ruth Sinurat","34","2025-05-31","5","Such a convenient location — the hotel is inside the airport itself! After arriving at the international terminal, just head to the 1st floor and walk straight, and you’ll see the hotel sign. Super easy to find. My room was clean, cozy, and very quiet — ideal after a long flight. It was located at the far end of the hallway, so it was a bit of a walk from the elevator, but not a problem at all. The atmosphere was lovely and calming. Personally, I found the room fragrance a little too strong — even with a mask, the scent was noticeable. But I think that comes down to individual sensitivity. One thing I always appreciate about Indonesian hotels is the amazing food — and this hotel didn’t disappoint. Great variety of Indonesian and international options! Would definitely come back if I transit here again."
"41.","Aman S","94","2025-10-31","3","Akses menuju hotel agak ribet bagi yang jarang / gak familier, sebaiknya ambil lajur kiri karena posisi setelah nge tap kartu tol"
"42.","Leny Irawati","162","2025-07-31","5","Hotelnya terletak di sebelah terminal 3. Aksesnya sangat mudah, Hotel yang nyaman, bersih, pelayanan ramah. Menu makanan bervariasi dan sarapan mulai tersedia pukul 02.00 dinihari, sangat membantu untuk tamu yang berangkat pesawat pertama."
"43.","Anggun Dwi Andini","6","2025-07-31","5","Pelayanan sangat ramah dan baik. Saya dibersamai Mbak Della di FO, bisa dapat kamar sesuai request meskipun dadakan. Keep up the good work!"
"44.","Aya","34","2025-12-17","2","You need Indonesian visa to access this hotel. I sent a couple of messages to the hotel to ask about this but they didn't answer. Eventually, I found out this information myself after arriving at Jakarta."
"45.","Alena Taylor","14","2025-10-01","5","Andi’s customer service was absolutely outstanding. He went above and beyond to make my stay comfortable and memorable. Truly one of the best hospitality experiences I’ve had."
"46.","David Vincent","330","2025-05-01","5","This hotel exceeded my expectations for an airport hotel during my two night stay. It was hard to believe I was at an airport it was so quiet. The breakfast buffet was extensive and delicious. The staff were friendly and helpful. The proximity to the airport train station made it easy to get to the heart of Jakarta readily! Of course, it was also easy to catch my international flight from the hotel's lication. Thank you for a great hotel experience!"

"49.","Tom","463","2025-05-31","4","Very convenient location with direct connection to the airport terminal 3. Check-in was fast and staff was friendly. The breakfast was disappointing as the food while impressive to see the big variety, was not hot. The coffee was terrible also."
"50.","Putri R","97","2025-10-01","4","This transit hotel is great! Just a heads-up, the TV isn’t working, and there were some off smells in the room."

"57.","BANGUN OPTIMA SENTOSA","1","2025-07-01","5","I had a very pleasant experience staying at Anara Airport Hotel in Terminal 3 of Soekarno-Hatta International Airport. The location is incredibly convenient for travelers with early or late flights. What really made my stay special was the outstanding service provided by Ms. Tria. She was exceptionally friendly, helpful, and professional. From the moment I checked in, she made sure everything went smoothly and was always ready to assist with a warm smile. Her hospitality truly made a difference! The room was clean, comfortable, and well-equipped for a short stay. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for comfort and convenience at the airport. Big thanks to the team, especially Ms. Tria!"

"59.","Yanuaru やぬある","637","2025-01-31","5","Hotel Anara adalah tempat yang sangat nyaman untuk para pelancong yang butuh akomodasi terdekat dan langsung terintegrasi dengan Bandar Udara Internasional Soekarno-Hatta. Lokasinya yang ada di Terminal 3 bikin akses menjadi sangat mudah, terutama untuk transit atau butuh tempat istirahat sebelum terbang. Kamar-kamarnya cukup luas dan dilengkapi dengan fasilitas yang oke, seperti WiFi dan TV. Suasana di dalam hotel juga enak, dengan desain yang modern dan staf yang ramah. Secara keseluruhan, Hotel Anara adalah pilihan yang pas untuk menginap, terutama jika kamu mencari kenyamanan dan kemudahan akses ke bandara."
"60.","Pauline","95","2025-01-31","4","It's located right next to Terminal 3 Soekarno Hatta Airport. 2 minutes walk to the Terminal within their connecting building. The room is quite spacious and comfortable. The amenities are great, for basic needs. It's also sparkling clean. Unfortunately, the room is quite too dark... it would be nice if there's a standing lamp in the sitting area. The air circulation in the bathroom is also quite bad. If you turned off the bathroom exhaust fan during the night, the bathroom left a bad smells to the entire room. Perhaps, there's a problem with the plumbing system. Despite of these two negativity, overall it's a nice transit hotel... with a great services too."
"61.","Naba Aji","243","2025-05-01","4","Hotel ini letaknya bersebelahan langsung dengan Terminal 3, Bandara Soekarno-Hatta. Pelayanan ramah & helpfull dr semua petugas nya. Suasana nyaman & bersih. Kebetulan kami kesana pas bulan puasa, sekaligus hendak berangkat umrah, sehingga saat berbuka puasa, kami pesan makanan diresto hotel. Menu lengkap & variasi makanan beraneka ragam."
"62.","Brian Nathaniel","11","2024-12-31","3","The room to the hotel is comfortable and well furnished. I did however need to get the floor vacuumed again. Also a recommendation would be to change the policy of charging $25 for a baby cot. No other hotel I’ve been to, even the cheaper ones has charged me for a baby cot for it is a standard amenity. Other than done I would have rated it as a 4 star hotel."
"63.","Paul H","71","2024-12-31","5","Had an 6:00 am flight so I spent the night before here at Anara. It was perfect. Easy walk from hotel to International Terminal. Desk attendant was friendly and helpful. Room was basic but well appointed. This was WAY less stressful than worrying about Jakarta traffic and transportation when catching an early am flight. I suspect I'll be staying again in the near future."
"64.","Ekawati Ningsih","2","2025-05-01","5","Hotelnya bagus dan kamarnya lumayan luas untuk lokasi di dalam bandara jadi sangat mudah untuk bepergian flight international tinggal jalan kaki, thank you kak amalia sudah menyambut dengan sangat ramah dan membantu proses check in/out, btw kak amalia cantik lohhh"
"65.","Jason T","26","2024-12-31","5","Missed our flight and managed to get 2 rooms. Rooms are better than some hotel we stayed in the city area. Staff are friendly. Only down side I think its at the airport so its difficult to do anything else. but u can have some food options at the airport. While leaving, the staff also checked the room and managed to catch up with us and reminded us on the mobile charger we left plugged in. Great Service."
"66.","Vanessa Perth","7","2025-05-31","4","Arrived at 10.50 pm , managed to book an in -room massage just before 11 , so yes the service is good . Location is of course strategic being an airport hotel within the vicinity of the airport . However the shower is not clean enough . And the noises from the outside gets through ( sound proofing system is not good ) . Overall it’s an okay experience. Value is average in comparison with other Indonesian hotels"

"69.","Yumi Hamansen","13","2025-03-31","5","Hotel nya lumayan bagus dan nyaman. Sarapan nya lumayan banyak variasi makanan. Pelayanan bagus, stafnya ramah2 Dan lokasinya di terminal 3. lapar tengah malam tinggal ke bandara saja. 2 menit langsung ke restoran2 di bandara."
"70.","Zaki Rahman","123","2024-12-31","5","Lokasi di lantai 2 terminal 3. Untuk akses ke sana, bisa dari kedatangan area internasional paling ujung kanan kemudian naik lift (atau eskalator ke lantai 2) atau dari keberangkatan internasional (check in area A) kemudian turun 1 lantai. Di situ akan ada sky bridge menuju hotel bandara, ikuti aja terus sampai ada tulisan Anara. Lobby hotel luas, kamar juga luas, fasilitas buat pelancong jauh antara lain ada toiletries (sikat gigi, comb, udah itu aja), tidak ada sendal kamar, tidak ada setrika, tidak ada lemari (kan cuma mampir bentar), tidak ada hanger baju. Untuk sarapan variatif sekali di dalam resto lantai MZ yang cukup luas Harga lumayan tapi worthed lah, nggak perlu taksi bolak balik ke bandara"
"71.","Veronique Godineau","93","2025-03-03","1","We are very concerned that this hotel is asking more fees for my husband who is a wheelchair user. We book a deluxe room through Booking, where they say that this hotel is adapted for disabled person. We choose Deluxe room and they want to charge more than 600000 IDr means around 36€ more for Deluxe disable facilities. What a shame. Be aware if you ask for accessibility. Regarding Indonesia law it is a discrimination that can be pursued. I also send this subject to Booking that cooperates with them and do have working conditions with them . Hope that the hotel will review it's politics regarding disable room access ♿."

Great location, pleasant stays, and the main reason I keep coming back is the incredibly friendly and amazing staff—both the receptionists and concierge. We especially want to acknowledge one of the receptionists, Briant, for being super helpful and patient while assisting me. He responded to every question thoroughly and swiftly!"
"74.","Tiffany Kartanadi","3","2024-12-31","5","I stayed here for one night because I have an early flight the next day. It’s so convenient that it’s located inside the airport itself. I also went to the Spa for a massage and my therapist Lia did such a great job. The atmosphere was so cozy and she was very friendly and she was experienced i. doing what she does. Definitely recommend if you guys ever stay here. Breakfast was also delicious for an early morning flight."

They provided recommendations for interesting places to visit in airport area, and organized transportation with impressive efficiency and punctuality. Moreover, they paid close attention to every detail of my requests. I felt like a VIP guest because every need was perfectly met. This truly enhanced my experience, making it enjoyable and hassle-free. This concierge service is very nice and makes me want to come back again. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a special and personalized experience!"
"76.","Jason Straubinger","283","2024-12-31","5","The room was functional, clean and the bed was comfortable. The soundproofing is excellent, you don't hear anything from the airport. Unfortunately more of the air conditioning and the other guests in the corridor. If you want to eat properly, you have to take a taxi and drive 20 minutes, then good and large selection of restaurants. Not recommended in the hotel itself and at the airport almost only fast food in the public area of T3."
"77.","YM UtuBe","216","2025-03-03","4","Stay here for 1 night, location is easy to find from arrival section , if still confused ask someone with any uniforms duty forsure he/she will know about the place. So from arrival is around 5 to 10 minute by walking All Staff very responsive and helpful. Shout out to security and front line desk And If u stay here with breakfast package, the breakfast is so Many option from Indonesian food and western. And hear me out the breakfast is open from 2 am aka early morning, is Really crazy, is 2 am. I never seen in any hotels who open or ready for breakfast at 2 am, Only one concern I would say about this place the light in the room is not quite bright. It is like dim lights to me and prepare to rest and sleep. Well May be that is the concept from this hotel, for resting and sleep. And also room number is quite confusing at first, so odd number is right side and even number on the left side CMIIW 😬😂 I almost call the receptionist to make sure where’s the room coz I came to realize that I went the odd number which in the right side. Or May be I’m just tired after long flight and delay. Last but not least, thank you for your helpful staff."

"80.","rebecca Parr","9","2025-05-01","1","Very disappointing. I am paying 1,474,305 IRD for a four hour stay as they would not accommodate an early check in. Tried to call them to discuss and was unable to get through each time. No reply to my emails either. I would have thought, being an airport hotel, they would be flexible with check in times, but they insisted on a further 950,000IRD for an early check in. I have rooms booked with them for April and May as I have connecting flights on the same day and I wish I had booked elsewhere. Very poor service."

"82.","Wally Muzlantov","213","2024-12-31","5","If you are looking for a hotel that is convenient and close to the airport then this is the hotel you should choose. All staff at this hotel go out of their way to assist you and do their best to accommodate you. Every team member from reception , luggage storage concierge will do their best for you and will assist you in any way they can . The room was quite big the Junior Suite , the room was quite spacious as you still had plenty of room to move even with your luggage. The bathroom was quite spacious also as you had a shower and there was even room for a bath that you could soak in after a long day's journey. The restaurant was located on level M/Z and you had plenty of choice for breakfast from Indonesian, Western and Japanese. You also could have tea or coffee . The hotel is just a 2 minute walk to the terminal and check in counters. This is as convenient as it can get for you to be have a hotel this close to the airport, but if you want to go anywhere especially the PIK area then it is a 29 minute drive. If I had a chance I would come back to this hotel again just for its pure convenience."

From domestic arrivals, it is a little hard to find. From the T3 outdoor meeting area courtyard, we walked into the parking garage and took the elevator to level 3, where there are signs for Anara. Much easier from international arrivals, just go up a floor and take the enclosed bridge across over the courtyard."

The amenities are quite complete, and they serve a simple breakfast from 2 AM to 5 AM, followed by a full Indonesian breakfast buffet starting at 6 AM. Very convenient.

But the shower temperature was a bit unstable. The service can be better, consider the hotel price is on the higher side. I think the staff should be more communicative, such as inform the guest about the breakfast time and place while check in, and ask first (if guest still want to take more food/drink) before clean up the breakfast buffet."

"104.","Putri A","46","2024-12-31","5","This hotel is a good option for stay if you are planning to fly from T3 because it's exactly next to it. To go here you can go from the parking lot building and go to 4th floor. Clean and decent bedroom, the bed is very comfy. Breakfast available from 2am (a few simple foods) and full breakfast from around 6am. The room is not really soundproof, if you go through the corridor you can heard even people are talking to each other in another room. But the sound of planes are not heard. The tv was ok, could not login to netflix because it said there should be software update. And the tv cable often lagging after quite some time (15-45minutes). The full breakfast is nice with many variety of dish like salads, (many dressings and each of it taste the best!). Doughnuts, croissant, pasta, omelette, dimsum. Fried potato is a bit hard. Beef slice is ok but some are too dry and too salty. Looking forward for another stay, hopefully it would be better."

This is the second time I have used this hotel during my travels. One night stays each time. Rooms are fine, nothing extraordinary and exactly what you would expect from this hotel. The rooms are very well noise insulated so once you are inside, you cannot hear any other room or anything outside (no aircraft noise at all). There is a restaurant with nice food for an evening meal, again, nothing exceptional but very nice. The breakfast buffet is very nice. I was pleasantly surprised at the variety and quantity. I would certainly use this hotel again if needed for a stopover. Note: the first time I used this hotel, the room stank of cigarettes, even though it was a non-smoking room. Reception gave us a different room. We suspect a worker had taken a break, had a sleep and Smoked in the room shortly before we arrived. The second trip we entered the room and there was no power. Reception gave us a different room which worked fine."

Praktis sekali + proses check in cukup cepat + AC lobby dan koridor adem + ruangan cukup luas + kamar bersih, kamar mandi juga bersih, dilengkapi hair dryer + view kamar kebetulan unik, menghadap runway pesawat jadi bisa melihat pesawat parkir dan seliweran + peredaman ruangan cukup baik + in room menu enak2, kecuali nasi gorengnya. Penyajian sekitar 30 menit. Masih acceptable. Minus - AC di kamar 1 ketika diset 17 selalu kembali ke 25 derajat setelah beberapa saat, seolah kami dipaksa menyesuaikan selera temperatur ruangan sesuai keinginan hotel. Kami sudah bayar lho, kok di lock begini AC nya. Saya terbangun setiap 1 2 jam karena panas dan harus setel ulang suhu AC nya. Keterlaluan. - hari ke 2 di kamar 2. Tercium bau asap seperti bakar2an sampah yg cukup menyengat di tengah malam. Sudah coba complain tapi tidak ada tanggapan. Ini sirkulasi hotelnya gimana ? Kok seperti kos2an saja. Padahal hotel masih relatif baru - air panas tidak konstan di kedua kamar. Panas dingin panas dingin begitu terus polanya. - menu breakfast terbatas, staff yang melayani juga terbatas, rasa lumayan untungnya - hanya diberi 1 kartu akses, jika ingin menambah kartu akses perlu deposit IDR 100.000. - menu smart TV tidak user friendly. Baru kali ini nemu hotel dengan menu smart TV yang rumit (sepertinya pakai softwate android stb gratisan). - Whatsapp hotel slow response. Telepon jarang diangkat. - Tarif kamar relatif mahal Semoga ke depannya bisa lebih baik."

Food • Had a continental buffet with a good spread, which was arranged in the main restaurant. • In room dining is possible. Accommodation • We got a deluxe room which in the first floor and request for rooms 130-139, which are very closer to the lift lobby. Value for money: • Value for money was satisfying regarding all aspects of the hotel. Facilities • All rooms had a Dental Kit, Sanity Kit, toiletries, towels and Bed Room Slippers. • Tea/coffee and Creamer are also placed in the rooms along with two 600ml water bottles and a kettle. • Every room comes with a TV and Hot/Cold water for showers.

From the smiling faces at the counter to the perfectly comfortable beds (not too soft, not too hard) to the late check out time (12:00) we soaked up the hotels comfort waiting 24 hours for our next flight. We even sat in the lobby after they held our bags all day and enjoyed a coffee. Very elegant and clean place and the breakfast buffet was great. It’s a little confusing to get to while it is located in the airport the airport is huge. If you try to find it from ground floor you have go into a carpark to the lefts lifts level 3. Please note: they don’t serve alcohol and there is no bar but the room service is 24 hours!"

No vegan food at the buffet. Staff speaks limited English so difficult to explain dietary requirements (even with the help of Google Translate). Booked especially because I was looking forward to the massage after a long flight, and the reviews seemed amazing. Arrived, then was told the spa was closed because of Ramadan. When checking out, I mentioned I would be back in a week, so if I could come back for the massage. Receptionist said okay, yes. I then Whatsapped the hotel the day before I would return to make a reservation, but now they said I couldn't use the spa/massage if I didn't stay at the hotel. I explained the situation, but the person on WA just kept saying no. I requested a reply from a manager, and how I could make a formal complaint, but they ignored the question. One week later I was back at CGK and explained the same situation - no reply. Truly sad about the lack of decent customer service at this hotel."

It overflowed into the toilet area and I had to use all my towels to help dry it. The bathroom floor is marble, so it was very slippery and dangerous to stand on. The curtain rod also broke in the bedroom, so closing them was more difficult. I couldn’t do anything since it was 12am and I needed to check out at 4:30am. How hard is it to manage a room? The front desk acknowledged my complaints about the room but didn’t offer any compensation. For $100 USD, there are better places."

Namun sedikit masukan untuk kualitas ruangan, dimana selimut dan bantalnya aromanya kurang sedap cenderung apek. Yang akhirnya tidak saya pakai, semoga kedepan bisa diperbaiki dan pelayanannya tambah oke 👍🏻"
"147.","Shin","6","2023-12-31","5","Kami ke Anara 26 Juni 2023. Menginap semalam untuk penerbangan keesokan subuh. Kami menuju lobby Anara dari lantai 1 gedung parkir T3. Ada petunjuk di lift. Malamnya, kami baru tahu bahwa lobby juga bisa diakses dari pintu keberangkatan T3. Begitu masuk lalu ketemu deretan loket check in, ambil arah kiri sampai ketemu pintu keluar menuju gedung parkiran terminal 3, setelah lewati jembatan penghubung ambil arah serong kanan. Ada juga petunjuk di gedung parkiran untuk menuju lobby Anara. Kami pesan kamar non smoking. Kamar kedap suara jadi memungkinkan untuk istirahat berkualitas sebelum terbang. Tempat tidur nyaman dan kamar mandi bersih. Air panas berfungsi dengan baik. Hanya, saluran pembuangan air shower tidak terlalu lancar jadi ada genangan setelah mandi. Saluran TV banyak, tersedia 2 botol air mineral 600ml, kettle beserta kopi dan teh. Kalo mau kulineran di T3 juga bisa banget. Sarapan dimulai pukul 2 dini hari. Jadi kami masih bisa sarapan sebelum terbang. Pilihan sarapannya: sandwiches; roti dengan pilihan selai atau butter; omelet; sereal dengan susu; ditemani kopi atau teh panas."

Kami biasa menggunakan room meeting untuk pembekalan jamaah umroh akbar, karena kapasitas ruangan bisa menampung ratusan jamaah. Makanan resto cukup enak, dengan layanan yg ramah dan fasilitas ruangan yg memadai di lengkapi sound sytem. Rate menginap Anara cenderung relatif tinggi di banding hotel yg ada di luar bandara. Bagi yg mengejar kenyamanan dan efisiensi waktu saat hendak bepergian hotel Anara bisa jadi pilihan sebagai salah satu hotel transit."

The only thing is maybe helpful to put some direction sign to find the hotel. We landed at terminal 3, walked out the exit gate, went through the parking lot and took the lift upstairs to the 3rd floor (where we actually landed and we only need to went upstairs). For the rest it is a good airport."

It’s only 5 minutes walk from the arrival hall. The lobby is accessible through the third floor of the parking building, you can easily follow the sign or ask the airport staff. Breakfast was just ok, but the staff are welcoming and work fast. For a long layover at the airport, this is definitely the best choice!"

Sebelumnya, sudah menanyakan ke Resepsionis, apakah breakfast ada pada pukul 5 pagi. Resepsionis dg penuh keyakinan menyatakan bhw Breakfast ada dimulai jam 2 pagi. Besok paginya saat akan breakfast, saya dan suami juga tamu2 lainnya seperti diprank. 95% panci makanan isinya kosong (belum ada masakan apapun yg disajikan). Hanya tersedia sisa2 sosis bbrp biji (Sampai rebutan dg tamu lain), bbrpa lembar roti tawar dan roti bulat biasa. Bahkan egg stationnya pun tidak ada. Pesen telur rebus kayak di warteg, kudu minta dulu ke staff baru dibuatkan di dapur. KECEWA berat dg layanan Anara. Apalagi menginap disini tidak murah. Tarif room 1,4 jt/malam. Saya jg tamu2 lain yg flight pagi alhasil cuma makan 1 butir telur rebus dan teh panas. Rugi banget nginep disini."
"162.","Amy Higgins","437","2023-12-31","5","Highly recommend for when you have a long layover in Jakarta. The hotel is easy to get to from a sky bridge on the second floor of Terminal 3. The rooms are well done with comfy beds and modern bathrooms. All the staff is welcoming and helpful. The massages are inexpensive and worth every penny. They can be done in your room or in the spa. Only negative is the coffee at breakfast- just head to the lobby and order a decent cup."
"163.","Craig H","28","2024-12-31","5","Stayed at Anara Hotel Airport in Jakarta. It is in the perfect location on Airport Property but outside terminal.

She was very attentive and very good. I felt so relaxed after massage. Thanks Anara Hotel in Jakarta!"

"166.","Ronny Wijaya","462","2023-12-31","3","The hotel is located at terminal 3 so ensure you tell your taxi driver about this as not all taxi driver know this place. The lobby look like a supermarket especially when it's so busy and everyone hang in there. Do not expect a luxury entrance, I thought I was going to a wet market when I got down from my taxi due to the number of people. Room is quite spacious and I can see the terminal from my windows. Tips : you can actually ask the hotel to help you check in your luggage instead of lugging it through. However due to the lack of staff when i checked out they could not do it for me 😩😩 Would I go back again to this hotel? I would say yes especially if I got early flight to catch and you have kids in your party."
"167.","Ronny Hendra","358","2023-12-31","4","Great location, if you can find it. It's on the 1st floor of terminal 3.

Eventhough it’s located inside the Terminal 3, thanks to their soundproof, we don’t hear the airport noise (but yeah we can still hear some noise from neighbor’s room). To go here, directly go to the international parking area terminal 3, 3rd floor. Here, you will find a lobby and direction sign to the hotel."

Bahkan karen kami menginap karena transit beda hari, bagasi besar bisa dititip ke storage room-nya hotel. Hanya perlu bawa barang berharga dan koper yg diperlukan ke kamar. Room 330, view-nya ke parkiran mobil. Pilihan makanan yaa semua yg ada di terminal 3. Walau karena keluarga ada yang nyamper, uda sekalian dibawain makanan. Karena kami juga uda lelah, malem cuma makan dan langsung istirahat untuk persiapan flight besok pagi, jadi gga kepikiran jalan-jalan di terminal 3. Padahal uda ngincer photo booth di gate E Sarapan jam 6 tp kami juga uda mau check out jd sarapannya kami kasi ke keluarga yg nganterin kami. Untuk check out cuma perlu balikin kunci aja. Kamar mandinya ada shower yg bisa diambil. Jadi pas buat mandiin anak bayi."

"174.","Who's The Kitchen Fairy","145","2023-12-31","3","Service was great, staff were so friendly! We ordered room service and were sent free pudding and ice tea, thank you! We ordered STMJ among others, and it was only tea, no milk nor ginger flavor, btw! But the free pudding and ice lemon tea made up the missing flavor, I guess 😁 Rooms were clean and comfy. Now the downside, if you just came out of international flight(s), super not easy to reach this hotel if you know nothing/around. Map at the airport wasn't that helpful. Airport Housekeeping staffs were kind and tried to help, but it was still not clear enough on how to get to this hotel. You had to go to parking lot area outside, that was so busy and confusing, to go to the elevator. Somehow it was the only access, we were told left and right, so inconvenient. Once you reached the hotel tho, it was easy to go back inside the airport. Which I don't understand why people couldn't go the same way to reach the hotel? 😅 The other thing to note, towels smelled old and moldy. Would still recommend tho as staffs were great and rooms were clean."

My tickets has a transfer at CGK airport so this hotel is the most convenient option. I checked in in the late night passed by 12am. After shower, when i was ready to go to bed, this is exactly what I saw on the sheet. Very terrible and disgusting. That was around 3am. Spent a night sleepless. Next day after I checked out, i saw they have SPA services. A 150-minute services is a good option for me to kill time waiting for my next flight. We started the SPA at 1:10pm. She finished at 2:58pm. I asked shouldn’t a 150 minutes spa ends at 3:40pm? The masseuse said the rest of time is for me to shower. This is very dishonest services. I complained at the front desk but the front desk has nothing to do with this SPA services. If you consider to have the SPA services in this hotel, don’t waste your money. Because it is like throwing your money in the toilet."

"181.","Rio Akbar","146","2023-12-31","3","I give 3 stars because of how infuriating it was that someone (i presume housekeeping) kept ringing the bell at 7am in the morning even though I was staying for 1 night. They stopped ringing as soon as i pushed the do not disturb button. Unsure why housekeeping or anyone would bother me if I’m only staying for ONE night. People come to this hotel to sleep. Especially after a long flight or a flight to catch the next day. Why in the world would you bother someone in the early morning THAT’S ONLY STAYING 1 NIGHT??? Besides that the room is pretty modern and has a nice feel to it."
"182.","Robert Wyrod","9","2023-12-31","1","FRAUD ALERT. I rarely write reviews and have never written a negative hotel review before. However, be warned I was charged twice for my room (once online on the hotel's website and again in-person at check in). At check in the hotel said my online payment was declined. However, that was not true. The hotel has been extremely uncooperative addressing the error on their part. I have submitted extensive documentation from my credit card for the double charge and all the hotel's payment receipts. Yet, weeks later they have not address the error or issued a refund of one charge. They had been completely unresponsive to recent emails and completely unprofessional, not to mention unscrupulous. This lack of communication on their part is as problematic, if not more, than their initial error. I WILL NEVER STAY AT THIS HOTEL AGAIN AND I ADVISE YOU TO AVOID IT REGARDLESS OF THE INCONVENIENCE OF STAYING AT AN OFF-SITE HOTEL."

Unfortunately, a customer from the USA who left their room until nighttime keep turning on the TV with the loudest sound made us move to another room. I asked to turn off the TV to hotel staff, they couldn’t handle it. When they came back to the hotel, their attitude was like “it’s over. It’s done!”. They never apologized voluntarily. They finally apologized after we said that they have to say sorry. That’s never the hotel’s fail, but still, we wished that if they could handle it more."
"187.","Andi Muhlis","298","2022-12-31","5","Pertama dan yg utama adalah lokasi! Hotel ini benar-benar hanya sepelemparan batu dari Terminal 3. Hanya dengan berjalan kaki dari T3 anda sudah bisa menjangkaunya. Level lobby berada di lantai 3 yang juga bisa dijangkau dari gedung parkir penumpang internasional dan juga area penjemputan di West Gate. Kedua adalah kualitas kamar. Interiornya bagus. Kedap suara dari luar sehingga suara lalu lalang pesawat tidak akan mengganggu istirahat anda, meski disayangkan justru suara dari koridor yang bisa masuk ke dalam kamar. Kelengkapan kamar memenuhi standar minimal dari sebuah hotel yang baik. Fasilitas restaurant mendukung kebutuhan para pengguna bandara yg membutuhkan sarapan yang siap dini hari. Hanya sedikit komplain yang bisa saya sampaikan dan tampaknya mungkin hanya karena kebetulan saja, bahwa tv di kamar tidak bisa diaktifkan kembali saat dimatikan. Dan interkom ke frontdesk tidak tersambung. Selebihnya adalah kepuasan, dan jika diperlukan maka sangat mungkin saya akan senang hati menggunakan hotel ini lagi."

The bedrooms are quite spacious and the location is inside Terminal 3 airport. everything was quite satisfied, but I was surprised by the slippery bathroom surface and the same floor height as the shower room - caused a water puddle and not dry in a short time. I hope Anara can redesign about bathroom interior. It is dangerous for the guest since the bathroom floor is always wet."

Only small criticism would be that when I arrived domestically (t3) at night and needed to search for the hotel there were no signs whatsoever where to go. After asking around I understood that you had to go out the terminal building, go to your right, straight to the parking lot building and there take the elevator to the 3rd floor. Only arrived there there were some signs for the last metres. The next morning getting to T3 international departures I saw several airport hotel signs, so i guess this drawback doesn't apply for international arrivals."

"215.","Fauzan Zamzami","49","2022-12-31","5","The best hotel di sekitar bandara. Kamarnya bagus view dari jendela kamar langsung gate buat boarding pesawat. Lokasi tepatnya di terminal 3, gabung sama bangunan terminal 3 international, akses masuknya dari parkiran international lantai 3. Agak bingung sih waktu awal nyari hotelnya, karna petunjuk arah ke hotelnya di terminal 3 kurang informatif"
"216.","wening insani","45","2021-12-31","5","Superb hospitality, superb room, superb location, and greaaattttt price. Only 5 minutes walking distance to the international gate and approx. 10-15 min to the domestic gate in Terminal 3. Remember to bring cash tho, cause they will ask for a key card deposit (only IDR 100K) and will return it when you check out. During the pandemic, they will deliver the breakfast straight to your room, start from 2 am, very convenient for you who have a super early flight. They also have a smoking room in the lobby, and it's quite cozy and seems to have good air circulation cause it doesn't feel... too smokey (?!). Overall, it was an awesome experience!"

Jika menggunakan Kendaraan Roda 4, akses ke Hotel Anara berada di lantai 3 Gedung Parkir Terminal 3 Bandara Internasional Soekarno Hatta, dan bisa juga dengan berjalan kaki dari Gate 1 dan turun ke lantai 1 Pelayananya sangat baik dan cepat, membuat Hotel Anara sangat nyaman dan melebihi dari sekedar Hotel untuk istirahat transit menunggu penerbangan selanjutnya atau takut ketinggalan pesawat karna harus berangkat pagi² buta .. Memiliki 2 waktu sarapan .. jadi tak perlu khawatir lapar sebelum check out karna bisa sarapan lebih awal di jam 2 pagi atau standar hotel² biasanya di jam 6 atau 7 gitu saya lupa .. Dan smoking roomnya manusiawi,, soalnya saya perokok .."

Wonderful breakfast with many choices. Love itttt. Services were spot on!!! The view from our window were surprising!!!! We could see departure gates right before our eyes... My baby was soooo excited to see that there were parking airplanes and taking off ones outside our window first thing in the morning. Makes it sooo unique. Overall impression... Don't even ask, wish we could stay longer next time!!!"

Be prepared to ask 4 different people where it is, before you finally stumble upon it. It's on the 3rd floor, down through the carpark. Insanely annoying. But rooms and staff lovely."
"226.","Kure Gile","8","2021-12-31","3","Saya memesan untuk 1 malam transit 2 hari sebelum check in, tapi terpaksa saya cancel karena tempat tujuan saya terkena gempa. Saya coba merefund tapi tidak bisa karena dalam CL harus 3 hari sebelum check in. Padahal menelpon hotel ini cukup sulit karena telepon tidak direspon sampai 10 kali, padahal saya menelpon kisaran jam 6 sore. Belum terlalu malam untuk pesanan mendadak. Mohon dipastikan bahwa S&K di hotel ini cukup membuat saya kesulitan karena terkadang saya pribadi jarang membuat keputusan untuk menginap dari jauh hari. Apalagi kondisi saya saat itu ternyata lokasi tujuan saya mengalami gempa Untuk selanjutnya mungkin saya akan lebih memilih hotel lain untuk transit daripada hotel ini. Terima kasih 🙏🙏🙏"

"228.","Mat Dodol","685","2021-12-31","4","This hotel is relatively new (9 months or so, I think). The rooms are great, well equipped and secure, but no English speaking TV channels. The people are helpful and smiley. Because of Covid very quiet so no restaurants open (not even sure they have any, though!) but there is room service. Dinner (we chose Nasi G) was good. The complimentary breakfast was not so good. Toast but no jam/butter. Scrambled egg, or omelette, made exactly the same way, with same taste, just the presentation changed. They will help you wheel your luggage to the check-in desks, which is very helpful and you pay what you feel like. We gave 100k - we had 3 large suitcases and 2 small ones. Would recommend if you need a hotel at the airport overnight 👍"
"229.","BeWee","495","2024-12-31","5","Location is the only reason you pay that much for a night. But the room is ok. Just the morning sahur restaurant is not capable to handle...

"230.","Shane Faulkwell","139","2022-12-31","5","This is the second time I've stayed here, but the first time I realized just how nice the rooms are for the price I paid (800K+ IDR). Well worth the money if you're stuck at the airport anywhere from 5 hours or longer, or if you have an early morning flight and don't want to worry about Jakarta traffic! We will be coming back in Feb and staying the night since I have a really early morning flight to Singapore."

"236.","K S","150","2023-12-31","5","This was a great hotel to spend a layover in - extremely good value for money with very spacious, clean rooms. However, it is very difficult to find if you are unfamiliar with the airport. As all instructions online are vague, so here is how to get to the hotel when arriving into Terminal 3. After leaving the customs/immigration area and entering the arrivals hall you are looking for the escalators up to the departures level on your right. If you get to the exit doors to go outside you have gone too far, turn back and look for the escalators up to the check-in/departures hall. When you are on the upper level, continue straight following signs for the carpark/airport hotel. This will take you through an indoor walkway into a building with airline offices that is attached to the carpark. Anara Airport Hotel is inside this building on its right hand side - it is reasonably well signposted once you are inside this building but it can be confusing getting there in the first place. In summary - up the escalators, then straight ahead, then it's on your right once you are no longer inside the terminal and have crossed into the office building."

Besides that, they dont have vegetarian/vegan options at the menu besides the ‘clean soup’. They did for me a vegetarian mie goreng (very nice though) but they should definitely add some vegetarian proper meals.... I was really hungry and didnt feel like eating “fried noodles”... but it was the only option:("

I very dissapointed that 1 small bottle of mineral water they don't even want to give me whereas if I sit for their buffet breakfast I would've been eating and drinking as much as I want, what a pity for such a 4 star hotel.

Because, from domestic arrival, there is no direction how to go to this hotel. Finally, I call the hotel staff via whatsapp. U can find the whatsapp number of this hotel in google. Their responds were nice. If you are from domestic arrival, after claiming ur baggage, go out and find the direction to the international departure or international arrival. Go to the second floor and find airport hotel. Airport hotel will direct you to the Anara hotel. U can bring ur trolley to the hotel and the staff also can help you bring your baggage. Food: I tried beef soup in the hotel. The taste was best. I like it. Especially because they served it warm. But, I don’t really enjoy the breakfast. For the breakfast, i only ate the fruits."

"390.","Christina Beatrice","97","2021-12-31","5","Spacious, clean, and comfy. Very close to International Airport. If you are around International Airport, you can find Anara Hotel very easily. Enter the airport, and then go to the left walk passing the A/B/C counter check in, then go straight to find elevator. Open the elevator by pushing it using your foot. And then go to 2nd floor, then you will see sign to Anara. BUT, last time i arrived in Domestic Arrival. This is kinda tricky. So this is the ways: Wait for FREE SHUTTLE BUS by going up to 2nd floor via escalator. Wait for around 15-30 mins for the bus to come. The bus passes Terminal 1 - 2 - and Cargo every day. ( I couldn't use taxi as they charge minimum fare for 100k) Go in it and get down in International airport on terminal 3. Good luck"

They forgot to wake me, I missed my plane, I couldn’t leave the same day, I had to buy a ticket again with all my extra bagage, 270€, 315 US dollars, 5,2 million roupies They apologized and offered me a 4€ discount for the following night, lamentable!!!!! I strongly advise against this hotel. Other hotels are just outside the airport, they are easily accessible with a taxi which will not cost you much"

Tolong ini harus di evaluasi kedepan, front office itu cermin didalamnya. Security gaya nya kek yg punya hotel aj,. Lebih punya attitude cleaning service di bandara yg ramah2 dan welcome."

Untuk hospitality anara buruk sekali. Kasih saran kaya angin lewat, natap tamu kaya ga ada kerjaan, ngobrol sesama staf rajin cekatan, tolong tamu jadi diabaikan. Good workplace mungkin ya buat hangout, cuman customer yg bayar gajih mereka diabaikan."

Tried to call them to discuss and was unable to get through each time. No reply to my emails either. I would have thought, being an airport hotel, they would be flexible with check in times, but they insisted on a further 950,000IRD for an early check in. I have rooms booked with them for April and May as I have connecting flights on the same day and I wish I had booked elsewhere. Very poor service."

We book a deluxe room through Booking, where they say that this hotel is adapted for disabled person. We choose Deluxe room and they want to charge more than 600000 IDr means around 36€ more for Deluxe disable facilities. What a shame. Be aware if you ask for accessibility. Regarding Indonesia law it is a discrimination that can be pursued. I also send this subject to Booking that cooperates with them and do have working conditions with them . Hope that the hotel will review it's politics regarding disable room access ♿."

Resepsionis minta maaf ketika dikomplen, tapi kyknya ga akan berbuat apa2 juga. Kompensasi pun tentu tidak ada. Bintang 4?

"699.","Emiline Smith","47","2025-01-14","1","I'm appalled by the service I have received here, absolutely would NOT recommend. The rooms smell like smoke and have a loud noise (I think the fridge). No vegan food at the buffet. Staff speaks limited English so difficult to explain dietary requirements (even with the help of Google Translate). Booked especially because I was looking forward to the massage after a long flight, and the reviews seemed amazing. Arrived, then was told the spa was closed because of Ramadan. When checking out, I mentioned I would be back in a week, so if I could come back for the massage. Receptionist said okay, yes. I then Whatsapped the hotel the day before I would return to make a reservation, but now they said I couldn't use the spa/massage if I didn't stay at the hotel. I explained the situation, but the person on WA just kept saying no. I requested a reply from a manager, and how I could make a formal complaint, but they ignored the question. One week later I was back at CGK and explained the same situation - no reply. Truly sad about the lack of decent customer service at this hotel."

It overflowed into the toilet area and I had to use all my towels to help dry it. The bathroom floor is marble, so it was very slippery and dangerous to stand on. The curtain rod also broke in the bedroom, so closing them was more difficult. I couldn’t do anything since it was 12am and I needed to check out at 4:30am. How hard is it to manage a room? The front desk acknowledged my complaints about the room but didn’t offer any compensation. For $100 USD, there are better places."

My tickets has a transfer at CGK airport so this hotel is the most convenient option. I checked in in the late night passed by 12am. After shower, when i was ready to go to bed, this is exactly what I saw on the sheet. Very terrible and disgusting. That was around 3am. Spent a night sleepless. Next day after I checked out, i saw they have SPA services. A 150-minute services is a good option for me to kill time waiting for my next flight. We started the SPA at 1:10pm. She finished at 2:58pm. I asked shouldn’t a 150 minutes spa ends at 3:40pm? The masseuse said the rest of time is for me to shower. This is very dishonest services. I complained at the front desk but the front desk has nothing to do with this SPA services. If you consider to have the SPA services in this hotel, don’t waste your money. Because it is like throwing your money in the toilet."

However, be warned I was charged twice for my room (once online on the hotel's website and again in-person at check in). At check in the hotel said my online payment was declined. However, that was not true. The hotel has been extremely uncooperative addressing the error on their part. I have submitted extensive documentation from my credit card for the double charge and all the hotel's payment receipts. Yet, weeks later they have not address the error or issued a refund of one charge. They had been completely unresponsive to recent emails and completely unprofessional, not to mention unscrupulous. This lack of communication on their part is as problematic, if not more, than their initial error. I WILL NEVER STAY AT THIS HOTEL AGAIN AND I ADVISE YOU TO AVOID IT REGARDLESS OF THE INCONVENIENCE OF STAYING AT AN OFF-SITE HOTEL."

We had the technician come to our room and even he struggled to get it to work. BTW, there are controls behind the TV surround/bezel, which hinges to the left. We had to open that to disconnect and kill the image when we wanted to sleep! Who designs these systems?! 2) then we decided to kill all the power to the room with the room-key switch but the emergency torch/flashlight did NOT work. I wonder what other hotel safety facilities are non-functional; management take note! 3) the room fridge was empty - a waste of space. There was nithing inside, not even water!? 4) the shower cubicle door opened inwards - a safey issue - but that did NOT stop water from covering the bathroom floor. However the staff were all very friendly and the breakfast buffet excellent, especially the bubur ayam (chicken rice congee). The location for the airport terminal 3 could not be better: an indoor direct walk to your gate, all air-conditioned."

Penyajian sekitar 30 menit. Masih acceptable. Minus - AC di kamar 1 ketika diset 17 selalu kembali ke 25 derajat setelah beberapa saat, seolah kami dipaksa menyesuaikan selera temperatur ruangan sesuai keinginan hotel. Kami sudah bayar lho, kok di lock begini AC nya. Saya terbangun setiap 1 2 jam karena panas dan harus setel ulang suhu AC nya. Keterlaluan. - hari ke 2 di kamar 2. Tercium bau asap seperti bakar2an sampah yg cukup menyengat di tengah malam. Sudah coba complain tapi tidak ada tanggapan. Ini sirkulasi hotelnya gimana ? Kok seperti kos2an saja. Padahal hotel masih relatif baru - air panas tidak konstan di kedua kamar. Panas dingin panas dingin begitu terus polanya. - menu breakfast terbatas, staff yang melayani juga terbatas, rasa lumayan untungnya - hanya diberi 1 kartu akses, jika ingin menambah kartu akses perlu deposit IDR 100.000. - menu smart TV tidak user friendly. Baru kali ini nemu hotel dengan menu smart TV yang rumit (sepertinya pakai softwate android stb gratisan). - Whatsapp hotel slow response.

Besok paginya saat akan breakfast, saya dan suami juga tamu2 lainnya seperti diprank. 95% panci makanan isinya kosong (belum ada masakan apapun yg disajikan). Hanya tersedia sisa2 sosis bbrp biji (Sampai rebutan dg tamu lain), bbrpa lembar roti tawar dan roti bulat biasa. Bahkan egg stationnya pun tidak ada. Pesen telur rebus kayak di warteg, kudu minta dulu ke staff baru dibuatkan di dapur. KECEWA berat dg layanan Anara. Apalagi menginap disini tidak murah. Tarif room 1,4 jt/malam.

"795.","장기태","2","2024-01-14","2","Jaraknya kurang dari 5 menit berjalan kaki dari Terminal 3. Lokasinya sangat dekat. Lounge check-in di lantai 3 juga bisa ditempuh dengan berjalan kaki. Bagi mereka yang harus meninggalkan hotel keesokan harinya, ini adalah hotel yang sempurna. Namun, handuknya dalam kondisi yang sangat buruk. Dan tidak ada petunjuk tentang cara menggunakan TV atau telepon. Mungkin karena ini adalah hotel untuk menginap singkat, berbagai layanannya kurang lengkap. Sarapannya biasa saja, hanya cukup untuk makan cepat."
"796.","24 mas_","27","2024-01-14","2","Terhubung langsung ke Terminal 3 bandara, sehingga sangat praktis. Namun, ada tiga masalah utama. 1. Kepala pancuran tidak terpasang dengan benar, dan saat mandi, pancuran perlahan mengarah ke bawah. (Lihat videonya.) 2. Pancuran berganti-ganti antara air dingin dan panas kira-kira setiap 3 detik. Saya menyalakan pancuran selama sekitar 5 menit, tetapi masalahnya tetap ada. 3. Ruangan terasa dingin, jadi saya mengubah pengaturan suhu AC menjadi 28°C, yang kemudian menurunkan suhu ruangan. Namun, setelah sekitar satu jam, suhu mulai dingin lagi, jadi saya memeriksa pengaturan suhu dan ternyata sudah diturunkan menjadi 23°C. Saya mengubah pengaturan suhu beberapa kali, tetapi masalahnya tetap ada. Akhirnya, saya mematikan AC dan pergi tidur, tetapi udaranya sangat panas sehingga saya tidak bisa tidur."

"809.","Ann Supatkitmongkhon","61","2025-10-14","3","5 stars for location : it's inside T3, on 1st Floor, the middle floor between Arrival and Departure. (Departures on 2nd FL, Arrival on Ground Floor) walk only a few minutes to/from hotel. Just follow the sign Hotel Bandara / airport hotel. There is a convention store near hotel. 3 stars for Service: quick check in/out, BUT when calling operator or room seevice or house keeping, nobody picked up the phone, I tried several times. Eventually I need to walk down to the front desk to speak to them. 3 stars for Room : it's spacious, decent room. But the water leaked out from shower door. After shower, the floor and towel was all wet. I saw many complaints about this on review, and it did happen to me too. There is no body lotion, no iron, but u can request for it. Towels in my bathroom were quite old. Food was no good. Better to walk to eat inside the terminal 3. Many restaurants, Starbucks, etc at T3."

Also a recommendation would be to change the policy of charging $25 for a baby cot. No other hotel I’ve been to, even the cheaper ones has charged me for a baby cot for it is a standard amenity. Other than done I would have rated it as a 4 star hotel."

"814.","Richard Farr","64","2024-01-14","3","A very short walk from the international terminal. Great for a 1-night stop. I wouldn't stay any longer. This is the second time I have used this hotel during my travels. One night stays each time. Rooms are fine, nothing extraordinary and exactly what you would expect from this hotel. The rooms are very well noise insulated so once you are inside, you cannot hear any other room or anything outside (no aircraft noise at all). There is a restaurant with nice food for an evening meal, again, nothing exceptional but very nice. The breakfast buffet is very nice. I was pleasantly surprised at the variety and quantity. I would certainly use this hotel again if needed for a stopover. Note: the first time I used this hotel, the room stank of cigarettes, even though it was a non-smoking room. Reception gave us a different room. We suspect a worker had taken a break, had a sleep and Smoked in the room shortly before we arrived. The second trip we entered the room and there was no power. Reception gave us a different room which worked fine."
"815.","Rodolfo Rocha","70","2024-01-14","3","The rooms are fine, nothing special, it feels overpriced for the service. The towels are super thin and they were stinky. The breakfast surprised me for the variety, but the taste wasn’t good. The only good thing is the location - a little hard to find but the airport itself is hard to navigate so…"
"816.","Ronny Wijaya","465","2024-01-14","3","The hotel is located at terminal 3 so ensure you tell your taxi driver about this as not all taxi driver know this place. The lobby look like a supermarket especially when it's so busy and everyone hang in there. Do not expect a luxury entrance, I thought I was going to a wet market when I got down from my taxi due to the number of people. Room is quite spacious and I can see the terminal from my windows. Tips : you can actually ask the hotel to help you check in your luggage instead of lugging it through. However due to the lack of staff when i checked out they could not do it for me 😩😩 Would I go back again to this hotel? I would say yes especially if I got early flight to catch and you have kids in your party."
"817.","Apriani Cullen","13","2024-01-14","3","Room is clean, modern, water pressure in bathroom also great. However there is blood stain in the bed sheet, 😥 was too tired to check when we arrive, when about to sleep just notice it , buffet breakfast was ok, nothing special though, i assume they didnt wash the grapes , look so dirty. Will i comeback again to this hotel? Yes, i will stay in this hotel in the future again, location so convenient near the airport. Hopefully wont be a blood stain in my next stay 😣"
"818.","Who's The Kitchen Fairy","146","2024-01-14","3","Service was great, staff were so friendly! We ordered room service and were sent free pudding and ice tea, thank you! We ordered STMJ among others, and it was only tea, no milk nor ginger flavor, btw! But the free pudding and ice lemon tea made up the missing flavor, I guess 😁 Rooms were clean and comfy. Now the downside, if you just came out of international flight(s), super not easy to reach this hotel if you know nothing/around. Map at the airport wasn't that helpful. Airport Housekeeping staffs were kind and tried to help, but it was still not clear enough on how to get to this hotel. You had to go to parking lot area outside, that was so busy and confusing, to go to the elevator. Somehow it was the only access, we were told left and right, so inconvenient. Once you reached the hotel tho, it was easy to go back inside the airport. Which I don't understand why people couldn't go the same way to reach the hotel? 😅 The other thing to note, towels smelled old and moldy. Would still recommend tho as staffs were great and rooms were clean."
"819.","Rio Akbar","147","2024-01-14","3","I give 3 stars because of how infuriating it was that someone (i presume housekeeping) kept ringing the bell at 7am in the morning even though I was staying for 1 night. They stopped ringing as soon as i pushed the do not disturb button. Unsure why housekeeping or anyone would bother me if I’m only staying for ONE night. People come to this hotel to sleep. Especially after a long flight or a flight to catch the next day. Why in the world would you bother someone in the early morning THAT’S ONLY STAYING 1 NIGHT??? Besides that the room is pretty modern and has a nice feel to it."
"820.","Rika","24","2023-01-14","3","The room is clean and very convenient location which is inside the airport. Also, the morning breakfast and staffs are nice. Unfortunately, a customer from the USA who left their room until nighttime keep turning on the TV with the loudest sound made us move to another room. I asked to turn off the TV to hotel staff, they couldn’t handle it. When they came back to the hotel, their attitude was like “it’s over. It’s done!”. They never apologized voluntarily. They finally apologized after we said that they have to say sorry. That’s never the hotel’s fail, but still, we wished that if they could handle it more."
"821.","E. WALUYO","107","2024-01-14","3","Everything is great except the shower. The hot water only flows a few seconds then you get cold water a few other seconds and they just go that way simultaneously.. never got this kind of setting in any other hotels. This kind of setting just ruined the whole experience. I stayed twice already and got the same experience in both stays."
"822.","Kure Gile","9","2022-01-14","3","Saya memesan untuk 1 malam transit 2 hari sebelum check in, tapi terpaksa saya cancel karena tempat tujuan saya terkena gempa. Saya coba merefund tapi tidak bisa karena dalam CL harus 3 hari sebelum check in. Padahal menelpon hotel ini cukup sulit karena telepon tidak direspon sampai 10 kali, padahal saya menelpon kisaran jam 6 sore. Belum terlalu malam untuk pesanan mendadak. Mohon dipastikan bahwa S&K di hotel ini cukup membuat saya kesulitan karena terkadang saya pribadi jarang membuat keputusan untuk menginap dari jauh hari. Apalagi kondisi saya saat itu ternyata lokasi tujuan saya mengalami gempa Untuk selanjutnya mungkin saya akan lebih memilih hotel lain untuk transit daripada hotel ini. Terima kasih 🙏🙏🙏"

"824.","Lasak Air","10","2022-01-14","3","Hotel is inside terminal 3, only around 5min walk to international gate and Garuda check in counters. Receptionist is friendly but not really helpful. Hotel food menu is not interesting. Cost IDR780k (20/10/2021) for just 10hours night stay to catch a flight the next morning. Learnt a lesson to next time hold the room until noon when check out, due to flight was delayed to 1pm, went back to the hotel 2 hours later to ask for the room so can have a quick 4hours rest and clean up, was told room was in preparation for next guest (that is another 6 hours before he/she is allowed to check in?) *reminder to all, it is a good idea to ask to hold the room just in case your flight has delay, room is paid for and you deserve it*"
