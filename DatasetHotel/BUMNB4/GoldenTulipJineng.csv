Hotels is about experience and hospitality, i didn't really get both here"

Kembali ke kamar jam sekitar 22.00, namun AC kamar tidak dingin. Call front desk dan tidak lama teknisi datang sekitar jam 23.00 untuk reset AC dan diminta tggu 30 menit. Jam 00.12 AC tidak kunjung dingin dan lapor ke front desk untuk ditangani lebih lanjut. Dan teknisi datang lagi jam 00.30 dan confirm AC rusak lalu pindah kamar lagi dan upgrade. Room : 1 Pelayan : cepat dan ramah (5) Sangat disayangkan hotel sebagus ini tidak dirawat dengan baik. Harap pihak management hotel bisa review kembali pelayanannya. Trims"

First, the room is spacious, comfortable and the view is very good. The gym and the pool are definitely the things you wouldn't want to miss. The breakfast menu was outstanding, they even catered our special request for food to be taken to our room since one of us was sick. There was a medical aid provided in case someone get sick. Everything was top notch. Definitely top of my list. The service? Cherry on top!"

Special thanks to Mr.Asta and Miss.Bella at the front desk for their warm hospitality and quick assistance with our queries. The restaurant menu also had good options for Indians, which we really appreciated. Overall, a pleasant experience, highly recommend this place!"
"5.","g h","3","2025-10-01","5","Golden Tulip jineng Resort was an absolute gem! The Golden Tulip Jineng Resort, just remember this name for the best hotel in Bali 😊The staff throughout the hotel were incredibly friendly and always ready to help, from the moment we checked in to the resort(specially bella, Ardana, diva, andre and so many forgot the name of some of the staff but all the staffs were good ) . They always greet and smile at us. Our room was very spacious, spotless, and well-equipped with all essentials, and with a fantastic view of the pool from the balcony. We loved the delicious food, especially the fresh buffet breakfast and so many options for breakfast, and the pool area was a beautiful place to relax. The resort's location was also perfect. It was a truly relaxing and peaceful experience, and we're already looking forward to our next stay. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to the tourists who want to go to Bali. Will recommend to my friends and family as well 10/10."

It was truly a wonderful experience the breakfast was amazing, and the evening dinners with relaxing live music created a perfect atmosphere. The rooms were spotless, and the staff were exceptionally kind and friendly. A special mention to Juli, whose warm hospitality made our stay even more memorable. My mother especially appreciated her friendliness and care. Overall, a delightful stay — highly recommended! 🌸✨ Aravind"
"7.","cyntya mitha","14","2025-12-01","2","Dear Golden Tulip, As a luxury resort in the heart of the city, I truly didn’t expect an experience that feels closer to a one-star stay. Quite an achievement for a property of your level. Is it really that difficult for your team to offer a simple apology for assigning us a room like number 350? We stayed only one night and checked in at 8 PM, yet even in that short time we managed to discover: 1. A light that was dripping and making worrying electrical sounds. 2. An air-conditioner that clearly wasn’t cooling easily (compared to the replacement room right beside it). 3. A trainee sent to handle our complaint. Is this the standard of guest service for a “luxury” resort? Even most 4-star hotels can say “sorry” without hesitation, and they certainly don’t send trainees to manage issues of this level or this is the way your service like? I’m giving you 2 stars to respect for the trainee who tried his best"

"9.","Alam Inder Singh Bhatia","11","2025-08-31","5","We had an amazing stay at this hotel! From the moment we arrived, the lobby staff greeted us warmly and made us feel welcome. The reception team was always ready to assist with anything we needed. The kitchen and pool staff were fantastic, and the food was absolutely excellent. The cleaning team did a wonderful job keeping our room spotless throughout our stay. We were also pleasantly surprised when the staff went above and beyond to provide extra items and services that weren’t even included in our package—such a thoughtful gesture! A special mention to Julie, who made our breakfast time extra special every day with her friendly nature and attentive service. This hotel truly delivers exceptional hospitality, and we highly recommend it."

"12.","Kamaldeep Kaur","36","2025-10-31","5","🌴 5/5 ⭐️ – Exceptional Stay at Golden Tulip Jineng Bali! 🌺 We stayed at Golden Tulip Jineng Bali last year and had such a great experience that we decided to come back again this year — and once again, it exceeded our expectations! From the very first moment, the hospitality was outstanding. A big thank you to Asta and Bella at the front desk — both were so warm, professional, and welcoming. They greeted us with genuine smiles and made our check-in process super quick and easy. They patiently answered all our questions, ensured everything was perfect, and even remembered us from our last stay — which felt really special. 💛 Later in the evening, we met Ardana, Andrew, Dian, and Keisya, who were on duty — and they were equally amazing! They were always cheerful, attentive, and ready to help with anything we needed, whether it was arranging something for the room or just checking in to make sure our stay was comfortable. Their friendly nature and positive energy truly made our evenings pleasant. Honestly, it’s the staff that makes Golden Tulip Jineng Bali stand out. Every person here goes above and beyond to make you feel cared for. Their kindness, professionalism, and personal touch make this place feel like a home away from home. The hotel itself is beautiful — peaceful ambiance, spacious rooms, delicious breakfast, and a lovely pool area perfect for relaxing. But what keeps us coming back is the warmth of the people who work here. Thank you once again to Asta, Bella, Ardana, Andrew, Dian, and Keisya, and the entire Golden Tulip team for making our stay truly unforgettable. We’ll definitely be returning again soon! 🌺✨"

Seneng banget bisa dapet kamar special dan keluar kamar langsung bisa berenang 🤩. Kamarnya bersih dan luas. Staffnya ramah dan sangat membantu. Sarapannya lengkap dan enak-enak rasanya. Kalau ada kesempatan akan balik lagi nginep disini ❤️"
"16.","PG Customworkz","199","2025-10-31","1","Pengalaman buruk. Banyak bagian gedung yang tidak terawat, Kamar tidak bersih, lantai kamar terasa lengket, furnitur tua, tidak ada kursi di kamar jadi harus minta, pintu ke teras tidak bisa dikunci (kuncinya rusak), tembok dengan kamar sebelah tipis, suara kamar sebelah yang berisik kedengeran banget (kebetulan kami dapat tetangga yang berisik sekali), di teras banyak semut, suara dari jalan masuk kedalam kamar (tidak kedap), kebetulan kami dapat kamar yg menghadap ke jalan, pilihan & kualitas breakfast yg kurang baik. Satu waktu kami minta tolong panaskan makanan yang kami beli diluar malam sebelumnya tapi tidak diperbolehkan, padahal makanan itu untuk anak kami. Dipastikan kami tidak akan kembali ke hotel ini"
"17.","Mira Obadja","11","2025-10-31","4","This hotel overall is nice. Room has a crack to the patio door which resulted in numerous count of mosquitoes. The first night we came in to the room, we killed more than 10. We were tired after a long day of travel and had to deal with mosquitoes all over. AC was not so cold but thats understandable since it is hot and humid in Bali. Staff are all kind and friendly. Breakfast selection was pretty good."
"18.","Imam Nurhadi","225","2025-10-01","5","Kamarnya Luas ada ruang tamu dan minibar Dan semua kamar model seperti itu.

"19.","Nauval Ep76","1","2025-10-01","5","Liburan dengan keluarga, Saya sangat puas menginap di hotel ini! Kamar sangat nyaman dan bersih, serta fasilitasnya lengkap. Yang paling saya apresiasi adalah pelayanan dari staff Bella yang luar biasa. dia ada di restaurant dan di meja depan, dia sangat ramah, profesional, dan selalu siap membantu kapan saja. Terutama saat saya membutuhkan bantuan dengan transportasi lokal dan rekomendasi tempat wisata,dan dengan sabar memberikan informasi dan bahkan membantu memesan taksi untuk saya. Terima kasih banyak untuk semua bantuan dan pelayanan yang diberikan, saya dan keluarga pasti akan kembali lagi ke sini."
"20.","Bambang Waluyo","420","2025-07-31","4","Hotel bintang 4 daerah Kuta, tepatnya di Sunset Road dekat dg Bali Galleria Mall. Suana & fasilitas okay dg kamar standar *4. Cek in & pelayanan cukup cepat, ramah & baik. Stay 3 malam dg jam 6 pagi saya sdh jalan shg breakfast pesan take away. Menu cukup fariative pilihannya. Di hari ke 2 pesan paket omelet, sosis & potato, sebaiknya saat masak juga di cek safety quality nya karena di dalan omelet yg saya makan ada kawat cukup panjang sepertinya lepas dari alat yg biasa utk cuci pring dsb & kalau tertelan pasti akan berbahaya. (seperti di foto) Harap kedepan di pastikan semua masakan bersih"
"21.","Dini Arcita","2","2025-10-01","5","Garden hotelnya cantik terutama pas sore hari, makanan di breakfast juga enak dan banyak variasinya. Chef Sandy juga atentif dan very helpfull. Waktu di breakfast lagi ramai antriannya dan rempong sama anak, dibantu potong barisan dan dibawakan makanan personally ke meja."
"22.","Shivam Sharma","1","2025-10-01","5","I booked deluxe room with city view. They put us in room facing the big road on the 5th floor as I remember. Over all room condition was very good, complete amenities, and nice furniture. Just a bit noise coming from the road, i think they should start install noise reducer. Special thanks to Mr. Asta and Ms. Bella, one of the reception staff. They listen to my complain carefully and apologize to me and my wife, they also offer us to move to room in the other side wich has less noise. The other staff was very kind and cheerfull though, and we love the breakfast buffet specialy the local dessert."
"23.","Komang Pradnyana","955","2025-07-31","4","Hotel keren di daerah Sunset Road, Kuta. Pengalaman menginap disini selama 2 malam cukup menyenangkan... Lokasinya dekat dengan bandara Ngurah Rai dan dekat dengan banyak tempat makan dan hiburan di Kuta. Untuk kamarnya sendiri bagus. Ukurannya cukup luas dan ada balkon. Fasilitas di kamar juga memadai, dengan adanya air mineral dalam botol kaca, pemanas air, teh/kopi + gula, safe deposit box, sandal hotel, TV dengan jaringan TV kabel. Untuk kamar mandi juga shower ada pemisah pintu dengan kloset dan wastafel. Peralatan mandinya juga lengkap. Cuma sayang saya kebagian kamar yang menghadap jalan, dan suara kendaraan di jalan itu tembus masuk ke kamar. Jadi istirahatnya terasa kurang enak... Restoran untuk sarapan banyak punya pilihan makanan dan minuman, pokoknya standar hotel bintang 4. Ada tempat makan indoor yg adem ber-AC dan outdoor juga bagi yang merokok atau ingin udara segar. Kebun atau taman di dalam hotel yang melingkari kolam renang juga baik dan tertata rapi. Overall, menginap disini menyenangkan"
"24.","Theresa Johannes","6","2025-07-31","4","Hotel ini sebenarnya punya lokasi yang strategis, staf yang cukup ramah, menu sarapan pagi yang variatif & enak. Tapi sayangnya, kebersihan kamar perlu ditingkatkan. Saat check-in, saya menemukan beberapa bagian kamar yang kurang bersih dan kamar mandi yang tampak tidak dibersihkan secara menyeluruh - di area balcony ada sisa puntung rokok, kamar mandi agak bau."

"27.","Balisiwid","6","2025-10-01","5","Offering an excellent balance of comfort, value, and local flavour. The weekend bazaar adds a memorable layer to the stay, making it not just a hotel room but a place that connects you to the local community and culture. With Salsa Marketing ❤ helping to execute and promote the bazaar, you can expect those events to be well organized and worthwhile. It is a solid choice if you want a resort stay in Bali that gives you more than just the basics."

"34.","Arsalan Ghori","55","2025-07-01","5","I recently stayed at Golden Tulip Resort Jineng for 4 nights and had a truly wonderful experience. The room was neat and clean, with a beautiful pool view, and the 24/7 service was prompt and professional. We especially enjoyed the swimming pool area, which added to the relaxing atmosphere of the hotel. The deluxe pool view room was excellent and offered great value for the price. A special appreciation goes to all the staff – they were extremely supportive, friendly, and helpful throughout our stay. Overall, I am very happy with my experience and would definitely recommend this hotel to others looking for a comfortable and affordable stay in Bali. Thank you for the great hospitality!

"39.","Khania Olivia","6","2025-12-01","3","Disappointing, not handling customer complaints well. Definitely not gonna be back. I was long-staying in suite room type for business occasions. They had special benefit that they never communicated to me, not even once, instead they were gaslighting while i was complaining by saying that i could’ve seen that on the tv screen. They didn’t give any other compansation. One of my bad experience 👎🏻"

Got upgraded to their lagoon suite which was nice. Their pool is amazing, my firstborn spend her stay at the pool and the kids-club everyday. The staff were very welcoming, including their trainee. Shout out to Bu Ade in Restaurant, Ayu Sri in pool, the man with blue polo in the kids-club, and Jelita the trainee, those are the one that make our trip memorable, not only they give exceptional services, they even remember both my kids name and preferences."

"44.","Kusumo B.N.","521","2025-05-31","2","Resort tapi fasilitas di kamar sangat buruk. Saya booking kamar suite di 321 untuk 2 malam tapi kamar seperti tidak siap. Pintu pembatas antara ruang tamu dan kamar tidur tdk bs tertutup, kaca kamar kotor, furnitur banyak yg tua dan tdk layak bahkan ada pintu lemari yg jatuh saat dibuka, botol amenities tidak berfungsi sehingga tdk bs digunakan, bidet toilet bocor, sandal hotel tidak disediakan dan baru diantarkan saat minta, lampu balkon mati dan baru diganti saat ditanyakan, tidak ada menu room service dan akhirnya diantarkan buku menu dr pihak resto karena scan QR yg diinfo ada di TV tidak ada. Untuk F&B yaitu room service tampilan bagus tapi rasa kurang baik demikian jg makanan buffet saat sarapan. Hal yg baik dari hotel ini hanya staf cukup ramah dan responsif. Namun sepertinya komplain yang saya sampaikan ke FO saat check out hanya dianggap angin lalu saja."

"46.","I Ketut Rio Surya Jayanta Putra","8","2025-07-01","3","I stayed here about a month ago. While the check-in process went smoothly, there were several issues during my stay that I hope can be improved. Firstly, the restaurant staff were not friendly and rarely smiled, which affected the overall atmosphere. Similarly, during check-out, the staff interaction felt cold — just a simple “okay” and “thank you” without warmth or engagement. There were also issues with the room. The balcony door lock was not functioning properly, which raised safety concerns. Although it was fixed, the repair did not seem to be done properly. Lastly, the pool was dirty at the time we wanted to use it, which was disappointing."
"47.","steven G","24","2025-05-31","1","Will not coming back. Pesen 3 kamar, salah satu kamar ac tidak dingin, berkali2 komplain dan dibenerin hingga akhir masa menginap masih tidak dingin. Beberapa barang di kamar rusak contoh : meja yang miring jadi membahayakan kalo taruh barang karena dikhawatirkan barang jatuh. Shower rusak (selang bocor) korden kamar ada sobek. I mean, ini kenapa gak dicek dulu tp asal langsung dikasih ke cust. 2x dari 4 malam saya menginap, dari pagi hingga kira2 pukul 3 siang house keeping tidak membersihkan kamar. Hingga akhirnya malah agak malam dibersihkan karena saya harus meminta ke resepsionis. Pelayanan house keeping juga kurang bersih dlm membersihkan kamar, washtafel tidak dibersihkan, mug masih ada noda/kopi. Kamar juga berisik, ntah itu dari lorong atau dari luar. Beberapa kali bel kamar di depan terdengar kencang sampai saya kira bel dari kamar saya."

The stay was price-effective without compromising on comfort. The food was good, and an added bonus was the fitness classes in the evening—perfect for a quick workout. The location was excellent, with shopping places nearby and, most importantly, very close to the airport, which was the main reason we booked since we had a return flight. Check-in was smooth, and the staff was polite and welcoming from the entrance to the lobby to room service. Overall, a very good experience—highly recommend!"

The room is cozy and proper. The service is excellent. And the location of the hotel actually quite strategically suitable if you had a plan to go to city center (such as Renon, etc) and directly to Sanur/Nusa Dua (close to toll road access) and... definitely it is not to far (but not too close) from Airport. If you had a plan to spent your time visiting several sites aroung Kuta, Sanur, Nusa Dua but need to move quickly to Airport then this is the hotel that spot on."
"56.","Sarfaraz Sayed","1","2025-08-31","4","Thank Juli for good service and hospitality. We would emphasis you to have Indian shef for India food. Because the preparation of Indian for at your restaurant is not as per Indian flavour. Rest all is very good."

My room had a city view but was a bit old, and the bathroom felt a little cramped. Road noise was also an issue, so I'd recommend choosing a pool-view room for a better experience."

"69.","theresia ayu parinsi","2","2025-03-03","1","Baru aja check out, saya stay 4 hari 3 malam stay di hotel ini. 1. Ac di kamar gak dingin, hari ke 2 nginep udh kasih tau ke receptionist dan katanya sih teknisi nya udh dateng benerin.. tapi tetep gak dingin. 2. Sabun & shampoo di kamar gak langsung di refill? Kenapa? Harus minta dulu apa gimana? 🥲 3. Last but not least yg paling MENGECEWAKAN adalah team restaurant breakfast nya! Saya punya 2 anak umur 4thn & 1thn dan biasanya kalo habis berenang pasti pengen ngemil entah itu di pool side atau di kamar.. jadi seperti biasa sama seperti di hotel2 lain yg pernah Saya kunjungi, saya buat 1 sandwich untuk di bawa incase anak saya pengen ngemil.. tapi saya dibuat seperti pencuri banget ya padahal cuma 1 slice sandwich yg itupun untuk jaga2 anak saya pengen ngemil 😌 saya di tegur pertama kali sama yg incharge di restaurant nya, tapi saya ditegur lagi ke 2 kali sama waitress nya padahal saya belum beranjak dari tempat loh .. sampe di liatin segitunya tas saya untuk makesure makanan mereka gak di bawa 🙂 I mean.. kalo memang regulasi nya tidak bisa di bawa.. gak masalah kasih tau tapi stop sampai disitu gak perlu nyuruh seluruh karyawan breakfast untuk memantau saya seakan2 saya mencuri uang 🙂 Mohon maaf, tapi saya tidak akan rekomendasi hotel ini ke siapapun🙏😊"

The main plus point of the hotel which I liked is the restaurant area with good food and a good view. It had a pool area also. On booking dinner dates are available in the pool area with good arrangements. The staff was good and professional. The morning breakfast buffet was very good and if you eat non - veg food you will get a variety of options available. The fruits were fresh with fresh juices also."

Plus, there’s a Kids Club packed with fun activities for the little ones, and an amphitheater where you can catch live performances or special events. This resort really has it all!❤️"

"83.","Akhil Dharmaraj","45","2024-12-31","3","The location of the Hotel is pretty good right in the city with lot of restaurants close by. However the hotel being in city and the sound insulation being poor, spending the night was tiresome because of the continuous noise from the road / passing vehicles. Housekeeping part was decent , but they forgot to give fresh towels for 4 out of our 5 nights stay. The staff were extremely polite and courteous and should be appreciated. The food was of decent quality , but one thing surprised us as tourists was the cost of water being double that of iced tea 🙄. The pool was good , cleanliness of the rooms were just decent."

"90.","Gerhard Rumintar","8","2024-12-31","1","The reason I give 1 star review is to average down the google rating. In my opinion 4,2 google review is too high. To put you in the perspective, I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights, with pool view room Road noise was very very awful although I was in pool view room. I can't imagine if you get a city view room, I bet you will be a zombie in the next morning. Just don't, please do not ever and ever to choose a city view room. Sometimes at night you can feel the vehicle smokes from the street get into your room. Don't open your balcony door at night or your room will be feel so polluted. The have plenty of rooms, but only two elevators at each wing. It was so exhausted just to walk to the room. But, everything else was decent, The pool was great The park was beautiful The food was nothing to be complained for the price. The staff was nice This hotel should be 3 star rather than a 4 star hotel. But since this place acclaimed as 4 star, you guys really put high expectation for the guests."

"92.","Michael Hutt","235","2024-12-31","1","This is probably one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed in the rooms were all dirty when we moved into the first room, the water coming out of the top was black, so we then asked to be moved to a second room where we had exactly the same problem. Finding we moved to a third room, where the view was good, the room was still filthy, but at least the water was clean. The staff were exceptionally good. They're very kind and helpful, but in terms of the hotel itself, I wouldn't even give it a one star as a hotel and they need to do a lot of work to get it up to standard. The location isn't too bad. I didn't try the food, but I was a bit put off by trying the food by the cleanliness of the rooms. Also very expensive for what it’s worth."

Nginap disini karena suami yang pilih, aku pikir dengan pengalaman nginap di Golden Tulip Batu disini tidak akan jauh beda. Nyatanya?? Sangat jauh beda! Apa yang bikin saya kecewa? 1. Kamar kurang bersih 2. Tidak ada security yang membantu kami perihal parkir & keluar menuju jalan raya 3. Menu makanan restoran saat breakfast kurang variatif. Pemilihan menu & lauknya cukup buruk (saya pun tidak menemukan sayuran hijau/menu berkuah segar lainnya) 4. Karyawan bagian restoran tidak menghargai kami. Makanan belum dihabiskan sudah keburu di angkat aja dengan muka songong! Kita tamu loh, kita bayar tapi diperlakukan kayak begini 🙃🫠 Aku pertama kalinya nginep di hotel & gak mau balik lagi ya disini! Dan disini juga aku pertama kali nulis bad review setelah sekian lama vacum Bintang 4 tapi rasa bintang 3 🫵🏻"

Surrounded by everything you need Cons: We checked in, and the first room we got had a black water came from the tap. They tried to fix it, but didn't work. They said there were some problems with the pump. So they sent us to the other room. The second room was with beautiful view, but after a visit from technician, the water still came out black. Off to the next room - finally got the one with the working water. From one room to another, we noticed that the room and furnitures were quite old. Some corner on the bed were chipped, the floors had stains, bathroom looks murky, the wall were thins, even the headboard was dusty. It was acceptable if you only stay for one night. The pool and garden area has lots of potential."

"103.","Joshua","60","2024-12-31","1","The rooms are terribly soundproofed - you can hear everything the guests next door say, every door slam, footsteps at all hours. The hotel seems to be primarily occupied by Indian tourists who shout down the corridors, leave their doors to their room open, slam their doors and have no sense of consideration for other guests during quiet hoirs. I would avoid this hotel if you enjoy sleeping. That being said, the facilities here are lovely, the restaurant is great and the staff are friendly. Unfortunately the other guests spoil the experience here."

There is a wide variety of options to suit every palate, from traditional Balinese dishes to international favorites. ●Also has great swimming pool. 👎The only dislike is : they give us the road view side room and the vehicles noise is louder even after mid night."

Sudah saatnya peremajaan towel dan beberapa linen karena banyak spot meskipun sudah mencoba penggantian baru oleh pihak house keeping. Enginering terkait AC selalu dibahasakan kondensasi. Bukan kondensasinya namun apakah sudah melakukan maintenance berkala dengan pencucian in dan out nya serta cek freon karena banyak kamar yg mengalami kebocoran.. Dimaksimalkan lagi deh.. Banyak kok hotel lama namun masih ok semua dari segala aspek. Semoga segera ada perubahan"

Tapi voucher hotel jg berbayar bukan gratisan, bahkan rencana additional room, tapi infonya kamar penuh, krn kt mmg request yg berdekatan/connecting room Dan akhirnya setelah melakukan reservasi di info kembali d berikan kamar yg di upgrade ke type suite Thanks to rysa yg sdh handle bookingan & seplin yg fast response. Period stay : 12-13 May 2024 - saat tiba melakukan proses c/i di reception tidak mendapatkan welcome drink, dan lsg saja di antarkan oleh bell boy k kamar, sesampainya dpn kmr, kunci kmr tdk bs di buka oleh bellboy & master key yg d bw oleh HK incharge di lantai tsb jg tdk bs membuka, akhirnya kt d suruh balik k lobby utk menunggu krn kunci katanya mau d cek dlu. Setelah kita menunggu d lobby sekitar 20 menit tanpa welcome drink juga, tdk ada info apakah kunci sdh ready ato blm, akhirnya k receptionistlah utk menanyakan gmn masalah kunci td, di reception ada 3 org yg incharge, yg laki” blg msh d cek & yg wanita blg sdh done kok, gmn ya koordinasi mereka, klo ga d samperin ke meja reception brrti kt ga akan d update & ttp bengong nungguin kunci yg ga jelas - ⁠Pelayanan yg diberikan sgt terlihat perbedaannya antara melayani foreigner & lokal (dgn foreigner sgt sigap, dgn lokal spt ga niat) - ⁠sampai di kamar slipper tdk ada, bathrobe tdk ada, apa mungkin stdnya spt ini di type kmr suite ? - ⁠Extra bed sdh terset up saat masuk kamar sekitar jam 3, pdhal sdh request saat reservasi agar jgn d set up dulu & bs d set up setelah jam 5 krn rencana mau take video - ⁠saat BF di resto diinfo hanya bs bfast utk 3 org yg termasuk EB padahal sdh payment 1 additional bfast di luar EB & tetep di bilang hanya bisa 3 orang, apakah tdk bisa cek di sistem dulu ada note atau tidak - ⁠saat C/O di lobby saya ada titipan paket via go send, dan pas kita C/O receptionist yg incharge diem aja, ga nginfo bahwa kita ada titipan padahal kita sdh mengembalikan kunci kamar utk segera C/O dan untungnya kita belum keluar hotel. Kalau kita ga nanya, berarti itu akan dibiarkan tertinggal di sana. - ⁠untuk dept lain spt reservasi, sales & security pelayanannya bagus"

"114.","Kelly Khoe","11","2024-12-31","3","Stayed there for 4 night in the pool access room, service was great, the staff is really really really helpful and fast respond. Every pool was also very nice. The room is very spacious, there is also sofa bed for my maid. One thing that is lacking is the cleanliness. First there so many drain flies in the bathroom wall and they didn’t seem to clean the bathroom. Because since the first night until the last night all of the drain flies were still there, including their dead bodies on the floor. Secondly, one day i put my kimono on the floor to get the new one, but when i came to my room there was no kimono on the closet, they just put it on the bed with the blanket unfolded. Next day i try to do the same, but again, they just put the kimono on the bed, didn’t even fold and put in the closet to pretend it was a new one 😂 Too bad because actually the hotel is such a really nice place and very kid-friendly… I’ll definitely come back if there is a guarantee that they will clean my room properly 😂😂😂"
"115.","Ibnu Ilmi","285","2024-12-31","3","Lokasi strategis, dekat bandara, tempat oleh oleh dan pantai kuta. Kelebihan : - Variasi harga kamar beragam dan cukup terjangkau - Walaupun bangunan lama, tapi masih bagus, terutama menghadap ke kolam. Lebih bagus dibanding pemandangan kota - Pilihan makanan cukup banyak - Saya coba 2 kamar, lantai 3 dan 5 ukuran luas, ada ruang keluarga. - Petugas ramah ramah - Dapat welcome drink dan roti 2 buah saat baru datang. - Fasilitas fitness cukup lengkap dan luas. Kekurangan - Waktu check in lama, saya sudah datang jam 14.30 - Ranjang lebih lebar dibanding kasur, jadi kaki suka kebentur ranjang jika lalu lalang - Kamar lantai 5 sangat panas, sudah minta diperbaiki sama saja, tetap panas - Ruang meeting terbatas, akhirnya kami difasilitasi kamar dijadikan ruang meeting, bisa masuk 12 orang, tapi panas sekali. AC tidak berasa, tidak layak jadi ruang meeting. - Pinjam alat makan kena charge 15.000. - Area sangat luas, jika kebagian kamar belakang bakal jalan jauh untuk ke lobby. - Rasa makanan terutama nasi goreng 70"

I guess pihak management hotel tidak benar2 berniat untuk memperbaiki pelayanannya, hanya sekedar merespon saja. cukup sekali saya menginap di hotel ini. please do not stay here."

The food is varied, they serve a different menu at each meal time, even the snacks always change. The garden is in good condition so it's comfortable to relax. Cleanliness and comfort in all areas are also maintained. You can leave your luggage at reception, and all the staff are very friendly and helpful.

"129.","Cialiv Anderson","12","2024-12-31","1","I have stayed here 5 times. The first time was 5 yrs ago. It was pretty good, at least up to standart. After that, it went down hill after 2019 to the point that i have to write a review. I’m pretty sure there is a BIG problem with its air conditioning system because 4 out of the 5 times i stayed there, the room is always humid and wet. I couldn’t even step on the floor without leaving a Mark because of how wet it is. It is not a location problem because other hotel in this area doesn’t have this problem. The bed feels somewhat wet/cold because of the humidity. The wall have some water drop mark and even black mold. The wallpaper is peeling on some of the area. A little advice, If you are staying here for a log time, you might want to go to check your respitary system 😀 The photos included are taken 15 minute after checking in. I also included a picture of a towel that i used for wiping down the wet floor."

"131.","Yohana Dee","353","2023-12-31","2","Pros dan cons menginap di sini menurut saya: Pros: 1. Lokasi sangat stragetis. Dekat ke bandara dan tempat oleh² ataupun pusat keramaian seperti Kuta dan Legian 2. Kamarnya luas dan kita bisa memilih pool view atau city view. 3. Opsi sarapan pagi lumayan banyak 4. Kolam renang dan gym yang cukup luas, pemandangan dan layoutnya juga bagus 5. Pegawai yang membersihkan kamar tidak berusaha memindahkan barang² atau merapikan barang yg berserak di meja. Bagi saya ini bagus. Cons: 1. Sekalipun kamarnya cukup luas namun kebersihannya kurang. Tiga malam saya menginap di sana...saya menemukan anak kecoak dari pembuangan air di kamar mandi. 2. Pengatur suhu air di shower kamar mandi tidak berfungsi. 3. Memesan makanan dari luar hotel diperbolehkan tetapi jika meminjam alat makan dari hotel, tamu dikenakan biaya 15.000 rupiah. Selama saya menginap di hotel dari yang bintang 3 sampai yang bintang 5 di Nusa Dua misalnya...tidak pernah dikenai biaya jika meminjam piring atau alat makan lainnya dari hotel. 4. Hal yang sama juga berlaku jika kita ingin menambah bantal. Per bantal dikenai biaya 15.000 rupiah. Saya tidak pernah menjumpai hal seperti ini selama menginap di hotel lainnya. Saya memerlukan bantal tambahan karena kaki saya bengkak (sprained ankle) dan harus dielevasi dengan diganjal bantal."
"132.","Andy Wiharja","77","2024-12-31","5","Area hotel nya sangat luas, sangat banyak kamar. Secara design bagus, dengan area kolam yang luas. Kamar nuansa kayu, seperti natural, tapi kebetulan saya pribadi kurang suka dengan nuansa begitu karena terasa lebih gelap. Satu lagi yang kurang disukai adalah lorong nya yang sangat panjang dan harus dikelilingi, karena tidak ada akses langsung. Overall, nice stay."
"133.","Surya Gunawan","18","2024-12-31","2","I was staying as a family last week and the room (number 555) was a bit dirty. Lots of interiors was visibly old and broken, the qibla sign was removed from its position. The worst thing about the room was that the running water was extremely weak. When I lift up the shower head, water barely came out. Imagine trying to refresh yourself by taking a warm shower before going to bed and the water was annoyingly slow. It was a real mood killer. The room was not safe either as we cant lock the balcony because the lock was broken. The room lighting was a bit too dim, I still could barely see something (I guess). The hotel is located in a main boulevard (and underpasses too). So it was noisy all day long and may spoil your sleep. I could not sleep really well. A roach managed to climb up the table when we were having breakfast too. Taste was below standard (overall), but they made perfect sunny side up. Fortunately, the staffs were super friendly and helpful. Definitely won't come back."

Apart from that, the staff were were friendly and I sincerely rate it a 4.5/5 overall."

Sangat tidak nyaman dan membuat saya dan anak-anak saya tidak bisa tidur semalaman. Sungguh pengalaman yg tidak enak dan kami tidak berharap mengulanginya untuk yg ke 2x nya Mungkin solusi yg terbaik adalah peredaman di kamar dapat ditingkatkan, karena suara jalan yg masuk ke kamar sudah sangat berisik dan sangat mengganggu."

Tamu yg antri di belakang kami ternyata sudah dpt kamar, sdgkn kami blum. Itu uda capek, nunggu pula lama, eh ternyata receptionist tdi ternyata ganti shift, kenapa tdk diberitahukan ke penggantinya? Akhirnya krn terlalu lama menunggu sy coba minta suami untuk menanyakan kembali kamar kami , klo tdk kami cuma menunggu tanpa konfirmasi kamar sudah tersedia tdk. Pas ditnyakan ternyata kamar sudah tersedia, kenapa receptionist tdi tdk memberi tahukan ke kami? Klo memang dia ganti shift harusnya menginfokan kpd penggantinya untung sj kami menanyakan kembali, klo tdk… kami akan tetap menunggu.

They assist me with many things starting from catching stranded gecko in my room, printing, package delivery and more. Good place for long term residence. The hotel is quite safe as well. I had few friends coming over and each time the security interview them to make sure they are expected before they bother to call my room. Room service and restaurant is pretty decent. Food is tasty, however quality varies. I ordered the same thing few times and almost each time the food came out a bit different. But still tasty. Room sizes and quality varies as well. The room (on the left side of the lobby) seems older than the one on their right wing. Had some problems with my first room ( AC wasnt working properly) so the staff moved me to other room and gave me an upgrade. Hot water was not really working in both room i stayed in. They limit contact during COVID-19 pandemic and only clean my room every few days."

"160.","Maddie McDermott","16","2024-12-31","1","How to start this review. Here are some of the few negatives that left my friend and I in utter shock. - Mouldy doors, walls, shower - Very loud traffic noises and bad soundproofing, hearing constant thumping from upper floor and surrounding rooms. - Leaking dripping A/C - Terrible smell from bathroom and sink - Disgustingly dirty bathroom counter with stains everywhere, didnt even want to put my phone down on it. - Insanely priced food with a 25% (!!) tax charge on total… AND; - They CHARGED us to use CUTLERY. Like a knife and fork? Even more for plates. They RELUCTANTLY heated up our own food in the microwave (which we waited 10 minutes for them to do even though the place was empty) - Broken table which was previously connected to wall and was now tilting down so everything falls off it, I broke my speaker trying to rest it there. - Very dirty balcony with dusty dirty floors - CONSTANT BUZZING SOUND FROM MAIN LIGHT. Stayed in darkness to avoid the buzzing sound. - Cigarette smell through air vents - Unfriendly front desk service Positives - None. Maybe the lounge area in lobby and by the pool? Recommendations: Stay at Villa Kayu Raja in Seminyak. Lovely place, we stayed there before golden tulip and the downgrade made us cry."

Saya diceritakan suami saya, saking dia penasarannya juga, dia lihat dulu suara langkah kaki yang terus menerus di depan lorong kamar, katanya dia melihat Poci lagi keliling tapi ga mengganggu penghuni kamar, cuma karena saya sudah tidur jadinya gatau apa apa, dan dia baru berani cerita waktu sudah chekout dari hotel.

Dan yang terakhir, saat checkout saya mau ambil coklat yang saya titipkan di kulkas hotel namun ternyata coklat saya terbawa oleh tamu lain, staff hotel salah memberikan barang yang tidak sesuai dengan kamar tamunya, apakah ini bisa disebut profesional?

Jika ingin merasakan sensasi tidur di jalanan/sensasi tidur di circuit grandprix Sepang (bagi pecinta balap mobil) silahkan book di kamar 201. Luarrr binasa, suara motor mobil sangat amat memekakan telinga spt berada di sirkuit balap mobil motor grandprix even sdh pakai ear plugs. Nyamuk dan bintang kecil hitam yg terbang2 dr kamar mandi juga ada. Pindah ke kamar 218 juga ada sensasi tembok tipis dimana bisa mendengar semua percakapan kamar sebelah dari jam 1-3 pagi lanjut jam 6 pagi, sungguh luarrr biasa deh, ada romobongan tur vespa dan anak SMA kayaknya. Sudah telp ke front desk tapi tidak digubris sama tamu nya. Intinya: 1. Material yg digunakan utk dinding/pintu/kaca sangat tidak bermutu, sangat tipis, jd tdk kedap 2. Pembuangan kamar mandi tdk baik, jadi semua shower room akan bau pesing/tdk dibersihin. 3. Handuk yg selalu berwarna abu2 bukan putih, gak tau bersih/tidak. Positive nya: Untuk staff rata2 attitude nya baik. Mulai dr check in dgn pak Indra, welcome drink di bar sampai check out dgn staff lain. Parkiran yg cukup luas dan ada valet. AC di kamar yg dingin, air panas yg baik di kamar mandi. Terima kasih utk hospitality nya. Skrg kami tau sensasi tidur di sirkuit grandprix."

They have beautifully set up meeting amenities with luxury look of black theme. Audio and video system are properly equipped on each meeting room. The male restroom are clean although most things need some renovation; mirrors are badly stained and closet are oddly old. Restaurant is cozy and have a proper size to cater all participants. Great and lovely hotel."

The breakfast was also good. The rooms were spacious and clean (I only stayed one night). The road noise penetrated the bedroom on the road side. So I would suggest you to avoid those rooms if you are sensitive to the noise."

This time they just passing us most of the times. First day went to chill in the pool while waiting for our room 2 pool staff were looking at us like dead looking!!!! Until we felt so awkward and left. Room, is old and after cleaning we still found dirty cups stayed where it was!!!! it used to be they cleaned and changed everything even sometimes they tidy more than they need to as it was my belongings. EVERYTIME I CAME BACK FROM OUTSIDE MY KEY DID NOT WORK!! after tiring going out and wanted to go to my room instead I have to sit on the ground in front of my room waiting for staff to give me a new key! DID NOT HAPPEN 3 times but 7 TIMES!!!!! This was so annoying! Breakfast was so awful and less option that my other stay back then! I literally missed my breakfast and chose to eat outside. This stay I brought my in law and I was feeling so bad as I told them that this hotel was so good when we stayed there first time but turned out to be so awful. Wanted to complain when I check out, but then when I checked out they did not ask me about my stay so here it isssss…"

That room accommodates 3 guests albeit my confirmation of a single traveller. Aircon wasn't working properly, with strong odor and mosquitos in the room. I cautiously mentioned to the Front Office that I didn't want the upgrade and wished for a smaller room where aircon works. She replied oh, it's actually the same Deluxe room category you paid for. They then moved me into a proper room, one I initially booked and paid for but my first day of short holiday had been ruined. I'd rather spend my money elsewhere where the service is honest. Good location, but doesn't matter, choose others in the area."

Dalam kamar paletnya perlu di benarnya karena ada bagian yang bergelombang, kebersihan kamar dan area diluar kamar sangat kurang, mungkin karena usia hotel yang tua dan maintenance kurang, untuk makan pagi baik dan kualitas makanan cukup baik."

The restaurant had some nice options for a reasonable price. The hotel itself has some signs of wear but it appeared they were doing some maintenance when we were there. The gardens and pool area are beautiful and well kept. The pool is nice but doesn’t get a lot of sun. It has a pretty sweet bar which is a little pricey for the area but the drinks are good! Definitely hit it up for happy hour 🍸 The rooms were nice without being amazing. Fridge didn’t seem to work too well though. The only downside (for us) is the hotel was very quiet and a fair drive from the beach and shops. So if your looking for a pumping pool area with lots of socialising this may not be for you. But if you’re looking for some peace and quiet this place will be great for you. Enjoyed our staff and a big thanks to the amazing staff! 😊"

The location is quite strategic, at the main road and you have many choices of restaurants, cafes and shop around. For the breakfast menu, they have various menu.

Anak2 suka bermain disana karena abang staff yg incharge di kids club (lupa tanya nama tp pict terlampir) sangat frindly dan mau bermain serta offer game unt anak spt mewarnai, x-box dan PS, dll. 10/10 untuk service dari staff di kids club tsb. Minus : untuk kamar city view 208/209 ada balcony dan view nya menghadap ke pintu keluar yg ada tulisan golden tulip dan jalanan sunset road yg padat dan ramai. Room nya tidak kedap suara dimana suara kamar sebelah dan orang di koridor sangat jelas terdengar. Apalagi saat malam hari suara kendaraan di jalan raya sunset road yang padat maupun suara motor ngebut di jalan sangat jelas terdengar dari kamar sehingga sangat mengganggu tidur. Harusnya kaca sliding door nya itu dibuat kedap lah untuk kenyamanan. Tidak menyalahkan sih karena tupe kamar ini yg termurah dikelasnya. Selain itu juga, sempet minta handuk ke FO karena satu kamar cuma dapat 1 handuk, dan kamar satunya sama sekali tidak ada handuk. Tapi sampai jam 4.30 sore belum dibawakan juga. Akhirnya minta sendiri dengan staff HK yg kebetulan ada di koridor. Overall, pengalaman menginap yg menyenangkan bareng keluarga.."

"207.","Edbert Prathama","22","2023-12-31","1","One of the noisiest hotels I've ever stayed. This is one of my worst experiences in staying at a hotel in Bali. There was a pool and garden in front of my room, I stayed on the 5th floor which was the highest floor in the hotel. There were back to back night events in the pool area at night, and the noise was crazy, truly crazy, people shouted at night (even at 10-11pm at night). Yes, you read that right. The hotel didn't have any noise policy. If you want a relaxing stay in Bali, PLEASE AVOID THIS HOTEL. It didn't feel like a hotel at all, the noise was like in a music festival, traditional market with people shouting. Although the location is great, but the noise really made this hotel an unpleasant stay. Note that the interior and appliances are outdated as well. 1/5 stars stay experience here. NOISE."
"208.","Joyce Kemala","291","2022-12-31","3","Review saya hanya terbatas pada penggunaan kolam, lokasi dan restorannya saja. Tanggal 3/7/2022 Kami coba pool package dengan 50ribu per orang sudah dapat 1 meal dan es teh, gratis sewa handuk kolam. Menunya beragam bisa langsung dipesan di restorannya. Cukup terjangkau dan makanannya ya standar aja enaknya. Kolamnya kecil dan pendek, cocok untuk anak-anak SMP. Yang kami sayangkan, kebersihan kolamnya yg penuh bunga dan ranting , warna airnya hijau agak keruh seperti jarang di bersihkan. Tapi yg paling kami tidak suka itu kebersihan shower roommya, becek, kotor, airnya berpasir dan kotor, sampai staff yg bersih-bersih tidak bisa berbuat apa2 lagi dengan air berpasir itu. Saya sampai tidak jadi mandi, hanya ganti baju saja setelah renang. Toiletnya juga tidak kinclong. Sangat disayangkan, hotel dengan lokasi premium dan terlihat mewah ini kenyamanan tamunya tidak dijaga. Tapi setiap awal bulan mrk mengadakan Sunday bazzar yg bisa dicoba untuk liburan keluarga, karena banyak tenant yg gabung disini, live music dll."

Overall alot of maintenance needs to be done to the building and rooms need updating and maintenance. Staff: The staff was cheerful, polite, helpful and always around to help. Menu: Menu was ok.

We arrived at 4.30pm and was told room was not ready… when we finally got our rooms at 5pm… shocked to see that room are dirty and toilet exhaust system is not working, it is so smelly. Could tell that previous guest has been smoking in the toilet even though room was a non smoking room. Just look at the mold and flies in the toilet. House keeping didn't even clear leftover food left outside the room from previous guest. They have no sense of cleanliness at all! Horrible and I can't wait to check out asap. Just I thought this was the worse.... came back to hotel at 11pm and thought I could have a hot shower. But THERE WAS NO HOT WATER! Ended up taking a cold shower!!! There is even CATS trying to come into my room in the night and morning! Walls are also paper thin. I could literally hear the door bell of next door! I really thought someone was pressing my door bell until I went to open my door. JUST DON'T STAY HERE!!!"

The AC is bad. we set it to the coldest settings and it felt like the AC was at 27 degrees. We ended up changing hotels"
"218.","Yan Then","6","2023-12-31","1","Saya Customer yang selalu ke Bali kebanyakan tinggal di Golden Tulip Jinreng Bali, Trip kali ini saya sangat kanget mendapatkan service yang tidak menyenangkan yaitu : 1. Bilamana minta tambahan air minum di kenakan charge dengan alasan Management Baru. 2. Bila mana minta tambahan bantal kepala pun di kena charge ( padahal biasa nya tidak ada charge apapun apalagi saya ada mengambil extra bed dan hanya di kasih satu bantal kepala, juga di beri kejelasan bahwa alasan management baru. 3. Bilamana minta piring kosong dan sendok juga akan di kenakan charge. (Alasan Management Baru) 4. Di saat saya memakai Extra bed hrg sdh termasuk makan pagi, di hari pertama saya dapat sarapan pagi, yang membingungkan di hari kedua saya di info bahwa Extra bed saya tidak termasuk breakfast. Yang membingungkan saya adalah kenapa pada saat pertama kali di system saya sudah termasuk breakfast bisa berubah di hari kedua. Dan akhirnnya saya memgalah dan tidak ribut saya tidak makan sarapan. Saya setelah itu langsung ke FRont Office menanyakan masalah Breakfast. Langsung Di Front Office mengatakan bahwa memang tidak termasuk breakfast. Akhirnnya saya suruh mereka untuk konfirmasi dengan marketingnya Hotel, dan ternyata di info bahwa termasuk breakfast. Setelah saya di sambut dengan perkataan maaf. Saya sangat kecewa dengan pelayanan sekarang dan profesional kerja karyawan Golden Tulip Jinreng Bali, selama ini saya selalu memakai Golden tulip sebagai hotel saya sewaktu di bali. Di data system merekapun jelas sewaktu saya menyampaikan ke FO Manager nya bahwa saya ini customer loyal, akhirnnya saya putuskan Check Out lebih cepet dari hari yang sehrusnnya saya check out karena sudah terlanjur kecewa. Dan yang lucu hanya FO Manager aja yang memita maaf, dimana FB Manager , Marketing nya dan Genenal Manager nya. Pada tidak berani menemui saya. Saya berharap bilamana ingin menginap di golden tulip jinreng bali dapat mikir dua tig kali karena selama ini saya menginap di hotel di mana saja tidak pernah terjadi charge semacam ini. Jadi janganlah salah pilih dengan hotel service semacam ini. Pilihlah hotel yang bener ..Be Smart Guys"

Saya yakin, jika tidak ada pandemi, menu BF nya pasti banyak dan lengkap. Untuk kamar mandi, masih ada aroma orang lain, dan saya coba gosok bagian nat keramik kamar mandi, masih ada bekas kuning, coba kalau dibersihkan, sambil disikat, kalau tidak disikat, bekas kuningnya itu akan membekas permanen. Bersihkan bagian toilette bowlnya juga agar sisa buang air kecilnya tidak menimbulkan bau. Ada kolam renang, tempat fitness, tempat bermain anak yang luas dan nyaman."

Worst, the water temperature keep on changing from super hot to normal and also the lighting in the room is very dim. Second night was upgraded to suite after i complained but the improvement was very minimal. Water and lighting issues stay. Worst in both morning, so many kids playing in the pool and very noisy that you can barely sleep after 830 (might not be an issue if its not holiday season). The only bright side in this place is the helpful and friendly staff. Overall, will not come back here again even for the strategic location."

"232.","Yohana Tania","14","2022-12-31","4","So far I like the hotel. The staffs are friendly and gave fast response. I stayed for 5d4n, the room is big and clean. But when they did the make up room, they always forgot to put something, like: toilet tissues, toiletries (like soap and shampoo), and towels. Oh and the breakfast was quite good actually."
"233.","Axel Juan Yuwono","40","2021-12-31","4","Tempatnya nyaman, sejuk, dan cocok untuk digunakan sebagai tempat istirahat. Namun, fasilitas disini terbilang kurang baik. Sabun, shampoo, handuk harus request untuk mendapatkannya. Kamar tidak kedap suara, dan kulkas tidak dingin. Untuk sarapannya enak dan memiliki banyak pilihan, tempatnya jg ada dua pilihan ; di dalam ruangan (non smoking), dan di luar ruangan (smoking area). Terdapat kolam renang, dan tempat yang cocok digunakan sebagai tempat berfoto."

The pool looked very inviting, unfortunately I wasn't able to try it. My only complain was the lunch and dinner food. It was so bland. Maybe because it's the buffet? Because my room service order had much better taste."

Hotelnya nyaman, bersih, dan sangat ramah para staff hotelnya tiap bertemu akan mengucap salam dan menanyakan ada yang bisa dibantu atau tidak. Pelayanan berkelas, pertahankan!! Minusnya saya mendapat kamar yang menghadap jalan sunset road, suara bising kendaraan saat malam pertama sangat mengganggu tembus sampai kekamar, serasa tidur di pinggir sirkuit. Saat jam makan juga, kadang meja pada full jadi harus mengantri, tapi tidak begitu lama."

Harga pool pass juga menarik dengan 50 ribu aja kita bisa berenang sampai puas dan ada fnb creditnya 50rb juga. Makanannya enak, ngenyangin bamget abis capek berenang. Tapi dapet minum air cuma segelas jadi saran harus bawa minum sendiri lg biar ga kehausan. Yang kami sayangkan adalah air kolam yg kotor, banyak pasir2 kecil di dasar kolam dan daun2an yg jatuh. Tapi dengan deal yg menurut saya oke, I can't complain much! 🙂 will definitely come again dengan harapan kolamnya sudah lebih bersih 😊"

"265.","chocy leta","1","2022-12-31","5","Out of the three hotels I stayed at in bali, Golden Tulip was the best. I stayed for 8 nights and the customer service was amazing. Every staff member I passed, they all greeted me with a smile. The front desk was so kind when I first arrived. This hotel was very well staffed, which other hotels lacked. I like how they cater everything for guests, like how there is a worker on standby near the pool and a pool boy keeping the water clean. The other hotels I have been to failed to keep their pools clean. The room service menu was reasonably priced and was easy to find by simply scanning the QR code on the TV. It also came in quickly. They also sent in a note to everyone’s door in case of any hotel disturbances like a meeting and offered us to join. On Sunday night there was a live singer in the lobby. They had fast wifi and the breakfast food was amazing. They always had workers at the front to open your car door when you arrive or leave. Some things to improve on for this hotel The air conditioner was poor and their mini fridge did not work. This led to me having to order an ice bucket frequently, one time they forgot to bring it. The TV was difficult to use as the remote didn’t really work. I will definitely be staying here when I come visit agian! Instantly missed golden tulip once I moved hotels 😭"

Bagian pool juga salah satu favorite saya di hotel ini, pool yang lumayan besar with side bar. Suasananya juga enak, kalo sore biasanya ada barbeque season"

But their suite room was good enough."

"270.","Melissa MW","40","2022-12-31","1","Kali ini kecewa dengan golden tulip jineng bali. Bikin acara zumba dipagi hari tapi ngga mikirin customer yg lain. Acara jam 6 wita = 5 wib Kamar di lantai 5 kedengaran sangat brisik! Kl sound proofnya ngga baik, tolong lah kl mau buat acara yg brisik dipikir dulu tamu yg lain bagaimana. Kita ke bali untk kerja, malah trganggu karena super berisik Update : Terimakasih untuk Manager golden tulip yg sudah merespon review saya. Setelah review ini anda balas, saya lgs di tlp oleh pihak hotel dan sbg permintaan maaf, mereka memberikan upgrade kamar. Setelah itu, dm ig saya br direspon oleh pihak hotel FYI : 1. 2x saya tlp ke front office untuk complain pada saat acara masih berlangsung, but no sincerly apologize from them 2. DM Ig no respon sampai review ini muncul 3. Komen di ig tdk ada respon 4. Google review di complain br dapat respon Dan staff anda (melalui dm Ig) sepertinya “mengeluhkan” karena saya komplen diberbagai media yg anda punya, jika menurut anda saya berlebihan karena merasa terganggu dengan kebisingan yg anda buat, tidak akan saya menerima komplimen yg anda berikan. And i dont think its a sincerly apologize. Dikatakan dari pihak hotel memberikan “beberapa upaya” pdhl baru 1x menelpon saya secara langsung untk memberikan komplimen. Wow sekali hotel bintang 4 bisa memiliki staff seperti ini"

Btw wkt pas check in, kita book dr agoda itu twin bed , tp ternyata sampai resepsionist bilang bhw kamar itu habis tdk tersedia, maka dikasih extra bed , ya sdh ok lah awalnya Lalu kita masuk ke kamarnya n kamarnya bau rokok sekali ( sedangkan suami sy tdk merokok n tdk kuat dgn bau rokok yg sdh nempel di kamar, pdhl dr golden tulip sendiri disaat check in blg klo ketahuan merokok di dlm kamar kena charge 2 jt n mrk mmg tdk ada kamar yg khusus smoking, nah knp bisa bau rokok ?) lalu akhirnya kita komplain n akhirnya di upgrade ke kamar suite n menunggu 1 jam lg utk persiapan kamar suite nya .

Ketika masuk ke ruang resepsionis Anda akan merasa biasa saja, namun ketika akan menuju ke kamar, akan didapati nuansa yang indah menyegarkan. Hal menarik adalah jika Anda mendapatkan kamar di lantai 1, akan ada kolam renang sedalam 60 cm di depan balkon kamar Anda yang terhubung dengan balkon kamar-kamar di sebelahnya, sehingga anak-anak dapat bermain air sepuasnya tanpa harus menuju ke kolam renang. Menu sarapan sangat bervariasi dan kualitasnya baik. Sinyal wifi dapat Anda peroleh di kamar dengan kecepatan yang lumayan. Saat dinner di malam Sabtu kami disuguhi tarian Kecak tentang Ramayana yang dapat kami nikmati secara langsung dari restoran. Hal ini cukup mengejutkan sekaligus menyenangkan, karena tidak perlu ke sanggar budaya atau ke pentas seni untuk menyaksikannya. Luar biasa!"

"285.","Stephan Spolet","4","2022-12-31","1","Booked this hotel for 11 days. One of the worst hotels I have ever been to. At the day of arrival the room we booked was not right. We ordered a room with two seperate beds, sadly there was only 1 bed. The hotel fixed this by giving us a premier room + 1 extra bed. The next morning we got our original room. The bathroom smelled like urine and our toilet was put on a wooden block. Shower looked really old and it looked like it hasn’t been cleaned for a long time. For some reason roomservice went knocking on our door at 8 in the morning for cleaning. Told the guy it was way too early and asked him to come back after 2 hours. Never came and our room was dirty for 2 days. Had to call everyday for new towels. Staff however were really friendly and the hotel was luckily cheap. I cannot recommend this hotel to anyone. There is potiental hence the good location."

There was no gate on almirah. All stuff is open to all. I booked 5 rooms,all have same issues. Lots of mosquitoes in all rooms . When we call for mosquitoes repallant spray staff came with 1 bottle in hand saying that they have only one. One more issue is that their lock system is not weak. Everyday I have to ask to change my key as their keys deactivate very soon.taps were also leaking . Room service was also pathetic as they never refill body wash and bottle by their own. Every time I have to remind them and once they even didn’t refill one day. Building of hotel also need maintenance."

You will surely smile when walking in any area of the hotel."

Tapi hari ini saya dibuat sangat kecewa dengan pelayaanannya karena hari ini saya balik jam 10.00 malam ke hotel, kondisi kamar tidak dirapihkan sama sekali. Niatnya mau istrihat tapi malah harus nungguin kamar dirapihkan. Akhir kira kira jam 10.00 malam pihak Staff HK hotel merapikah kamar dengan seadannya saja. Lantai tidak di pel, hanya disapu sapu saja. Urinoir tidak dibersihkan, dan Selimut dan bed cover tidak diganti. Apakah ini karena kondisi pandemic COVID dan penghematan budget sehingga kamar tidak dirapihkan? Lalu apakah ada SOP untuk kamar di semprotkan disinfektan sebagai protokol kesehatan??"

"304.","Nicolas Llovet","42","2023-12-31","4","I delivered a seminar for 60pax in their ballroom and stayed one night at the hotel. The room was clean and comfortable. Very good value for money. For the seminar itself, I used their ballroom. The room is well equipped with several projectors and sound. In my opinion, 60 pax is the maximum for an interractive workshop, there is enough space for 10 round tables for 5-6 pax. If you are planning to do some activities requiring some space, you may need to find an outside space for it. The staff is friendly and helpful. The biggest perk is the location. It is about 15-20 minutes drive from the airport and another 15-20 minutes for Legian and Kuta. So great location for your next business event."
"305.","Ed Joetan","6","2019-12-31","3","Booked online 2nights in street view room and 1 night in a pool view room (i figured i do not need the fancy view as this is a business trip) Cockroaches welcomed me to the room. Very small bathroom and cabinet. No sound proofing to prevent the road noise from getting to the room which stayed busy until past midnight. No solution for the first night since it was fully booked. Since I can not get a confirmed solution/alternative room on the next morning, I decided not to risk it and spend the second night at a 5 star international chain hotel. The pool view room is alot better. Special care was taken to ensure the room in a tip top condition. Hotel manager apologized for my nasty experience and sent a a fruit basket to the pool view room. Avoid the street view room if you are sensitive to loud noise."

Hot water was not working and i got to cotact to fix but not fix and they only let me have cold shower for my whole stay for 2days. Well, i got room changed but still had same problem all over the resort. Night duty manager was not helpful and didn't assist the problem, only ignored whole night without any information updated. It was a shame because all other staff at front desk and restaurant are very engaged and friendly. Other than that, I had a relaxing time by the garden and pool."

Ketika saya mengeluh ke staff yang bernama risa tapi keluhan saya tidak cepat ditanggapi malah dia balas chat saya dengan memberitahu bahwa anak anak GM dari GOLDEN TULIP JINENG RESORT ingin ikut acara nobar DENGAN GRATIS. Dengan semua kendala yang team saya alami selama acara dengan rasa tidak tahu malunya meminta ikut event dengan gratis?!!! Team saya memberitahu staff bahwa wifi bermasalah dan balasannya hanya “astaga” kita juga minta untuk dibawakan kursi untuk meja registrasi didepan ballroom tapi tidak diberikan hingga akhirnya team saya mengambil kursi sendiri di gudang dekat toilet ballroom."

Kolam renangnya tidak terlalu besar, tapi cukup nyaman dan aman karena di sekeliling kolamnya ada taman dengan rumput, jadi anak-anak bisa main sepuasnya tanpa khawatir terpeleset. Kolam dipisah untuk dewasa dan anak. Suasana cukup nyaman untuk dijadikan tempat kumpul ngobrol ibu-ibu sambil nemenin anak renang. Harganya cukup terjangkau karena include makan siang dan handuk, cukup bayar Rp.50.000 per orang, bisa berenang sepuasnya.

Dan sayangnya tempat pakirnya habis, salah satu satpam nya menyuruh kami pakir diluar area hotel, ya jelas kami keberatan. Hotel sekelas bintang menyuruh tamu nya pakir diluar.. Salah seorang staffnya bilang, krn bapak kembali ke hotel pk.22 lebih maka bapak tdk dapat tempat pakir. Lha... Masa kami sbg tamu harus diatur balik hotelnya jam berapa.. Spt tinggal di kos2an aja... Tidak layak lah.. Sekelas hotel bintang, menyarankan tamunya spt itu... Dan impresi pada saat makan pagi, yg seharusnya terjadi: tamu datang dipersikahkan duduk, ditawarkan mau minum apa? Kopi atau teh? Dan setelahnya baru ditanyakan nomor kamar dan berapa orang. Tetapi yg terjadi di hotel ini: Tamu datang masih bingung mau duduk dimana krn meja penuh, langsung ditanya kamar berapa? Lalu ditinggal tanpa di arahkan harus di meja mana.. Hmm.. Mantab deh..

They called engineering to come and fix , but apparently they never come , till 4 hours later we came back to the hotel and still have the same problem. We told the staff hotel at the receptionist that we are going out for few hours so you guys can come fix our hot showe. They never fixed, after I called them again, the engineering , which probably the honest one he told me that from hotel never asked them to come and fix our room. So I made second complaint telling them you guys better have a proper communication. Waiting for nearly half an hour our hot shower is completely broken, so the staff apologized and giving us an anothe room with better hot shower. It’s amazing cos they don’t charge us. I guess I will say thanks for their engineering for being honest and telling us that the room can’t have proper hot showe. The rest is ok can’t complain much.

They only change the sheets they don't actually wash down bathrooms or showers daily etc. pool filthy it had brown scum on tiles they need to scrub them daily not just scoop leaves out of the pool. This hotel is specifically for Asian tourists , they had all Asian dishes and rubber puddings for breakfast no bacon just yuck. Only thing we could eat was egg. The Asian tourists are so rude they swim in your pool access room from 6am to midnight screaming and laughing with their kids just so inconsiderate. pack your own toilet paper as they use thin small paper and only give you one a day. I asked to be upgraded considering all the issues we had and they wanted me to pay hundreds and then said rooms booked which they wernt.....the hotel should be half the price im annoyed how much we paid for the issues we had. The manager not once came to resolve issue. Our friends had issues to they had 2 single beds pushed together to make a queen. we should of be given half our money back considering that issues.

"343.","Matthew Thendian","3","2023-12-31","1","I am a customer who always goes to Bali, mostly staying at Golden Tulip Jinreng Bali. This trip I really getting unpleasant service, such as: 1. If you ask for additional drinking water, you will be charged , the reason they chatge because of the New Management. 2. If you ask for an additional head pillow, you will be charged (even though usually there is no charge whatsoever, especially since I took an extra bed and was only given one head pillow, it was also explained that the reason for this was new management. 3. If you ask for an empty plate and spoon, you will also be charged. (Reason for New Management) 4. When I use an Extra bed the price includes breakfast, on the first day I get breakfast, which is confusing on the second day I am informed that my Extra bed does not include breakfast. What confused me was why the first time my system included breakfast could change on the second day. And finally I gave up and I didn't eat breakfast. After that, I went straight to the Front Office asking about the Breakfast problem. Immediately the Front Office said that it did not include breakfast. Finally I asked them to confirm with the marketing of the hotel, and it turned out that the info included breakfast. After I was greeted with words of apology.but it is too late.. I am very disappointed with the current service and the professional work of Golden Tulip Jinreng Bali employees, so far I have always used Golden Tulip as my hotel when I was in Bali. In their data system it was clear when I conveyed to the FO Manager that I was a loyal customer, in the end I decided to check out earlier than the day I was supposed to check out because I was already disappointed. And what's funny is only the FO Manager who apologizes, where is the FB Manager, the Marketing and the General Manager. Don't dare to meet me. I hope that if you want to stay at Golden Tulip Jinreng Bali, you can think twice because so far I have stayed at hotels where this kind of charge has never happened. So don't choose the wrong hotel service like this. Choose the right hotel..Be Smart Guys Name : Mr Yan . T"

"355.","Balmore Aguilar","34","2020-12-31","2","The place is nice it has a pool not so deep, rooms are ok, and they offer you buffet breakfast of course you have to pay for it. The pool could be deeper tho at least half of it. Or have a pool for kids and a deeper one for adults. There are a lot of mosquitos in the rooms even when your balcony doors are shut. They don’t put everything you need in the bathroom everyday. They do say they have a fitness center but it is very basic and small, limited overall. They don’t offer shuttle bus for free and the one the offer tries to charge you 5 times more than they should or at least than a normal taxi would. If your going to this place download grab in your phone which is an app that works as uber, it’s much easier and cheaper and you can even use it to order food which is much better and cheaper than the one they sell at the hotel. Don’t try to get services from the hotel because they don’t look after you or your pocket, you’re better off reading reviews. Again, grab is the real deal. Break fast stops at 10:30 btw."
"356.","Matt G","19","2018-12-31","1","Westerners steer clear! Had high hopes for this resort with the amazing first impression upon checkin and all the positive reviews however that was short lived. With only a few positives being the first impression from afar, spacious/well presented room and pool view, that ends the moment you move on from reception. For a building that is only a few years old its clear that maintenance is at the lowest priority; as evident in the pictured corridor. Furthermore the pool deck is falling apart and quite hazardous, the shower in our room was poorly maintained and apparently its acceptable for a bar fridge to run at above 10 degrees! (I only know this because the staff member I spoke to in regards to this dismissed me and my request of having someone come and assess it even after another staff member suggested it should be changed upon our arrival.... it took over three hours to have the fridge reluctantly swapped) I would urge any western visitors who are expecting pork bacon in their hamburger to avoid this restaurant/hotel. Not that there is anything wrong with,what was presumably a predominately halal menu, the fact that it was not advertised anywhere is where we have a problem. For instance the buffet breakfast essentially had toast, sweet cakes and cereal that would come under a traditional western breakfast the copious amounts of other food were traditional asian/balinese cuisine (I understand that you go to a different country to experience the culture but the balance was way out here ) Even having conversations with other hotel patrons confirmed that we were not the only ones to feel this way towards this establishment. Over all very disappointed, will not return and will ensure that our opinion is made clear to anyone that asks about our experience here."

Our original plan was to spend the day at the pool but after seeing the room I asked my husband to take me out that I only wanted to return to sleep no option as we had already paid $92 AU we came back to the hotel at 11:30pm to sleep my husband noticed the aircon was not working we called reception and they send a technician I must said the receptionist was really nice but who wants to have someone on the room checking an aircon at 12am we went to the reception and they prepared an other room but to be honest the hotel is overrated the photos are nothing alike very disappointed."

"389.","Akshay Bapat","36","2018-12-31","4","Good Hotel.. We enjoyed our stay at this Hotel at Bali!! Pros: 1. Very clean and spacious rooms, with open Balcony 2. You get rooms with teamaker and other bathing utilities 3. Excellent facility with gym, swimming pool, poolside bar, poolside sunbath, places to sit and relax within the facility, amphi theater 4. Very good options for breakfast. They serve continental, oriental and Indian cuisins during breakfast time 5. Slightly away from kuta and seminyak beach if you want sound and calm sleep in the night as all hotels across Kuta beach are buzzing untill 3am 6. More suitable and recommended for families on leisure trip Cons: 1. Slightly away from happening places like Kuta or Seminyak beach, so its not suitable for you if you are a party animal and have gone to enjoy nightlife at Bali 2. Not across the beach, hence you cannot enjoy beautiful scenic sunsets of bali sitting at your room if you want 3. I would have liked rooms to be bit more lit 4. Lot of mosquitoes not to fully blame the hotel for it as the environment itself is so conducive for mosquitoes, but they could have put some mosquito repellents in lobby and rooms, i would suggest carrying very good mosquito repellant cream 5. This is a no frills hotel so, no welcome drink nothing complimentary except 2 water bottles per day, and toiletries"

They don't wait for you to give tip money, and they don't even expect it, unlike the common practice and custom in Indonesia. They help you professionally. 3. The hotel location surrounded by 3 spas / massage place is plus point for me. I can easily walk out, have message or reflexology, and then come back and sleep. They are good! 4. If you dare to walk 1 rectangle route (Jl. Tegeh Sari, Jl. Raya Kuta, Jl. Setia Budi). you can find a lot of nice food at Jl. Raya Kuta. We tried Rumah Makan Seafood Apong. It is good. 5. If you need basic necessities, Circle K is just a short walk from the hotel 6. My children love the kids club. The staffs in kids club are also friendly. 7. The bar price is reasonable"

"403.","christina mulia","3","2017-12-31","1","Ill-mannered so-called-manager! Case starts when we extend our stay in this hotel, and informed we got the room. Then when we confirm to reservation said full, the room not available. At that moment , we are forced to check out from the room while they offer us smaller room and lower type room from our current room. We reject the offer, and we talked the deal with the hotel manager named Gatot, to wait until 5PM, hope before 5PM got room available for us. So, while waiting until 5PM, our belonging placed in the small room they offered, with agreement they are not allowed to discharge our belonging till 5PM while waiting available same type room or above our room type. Or, honest said were, wait untill we got back to hotel. But before we got back to hotel, our belongings evicted from the room, they put it all in the luggage and bag improperly (note : the luggage and bag not closed ). And the small room already occupied with other guest! So its logic for us to be angry about this inconvenience. They didjt ask for our permission to do such things. The ugliest from this case was, the manager named Gatot , off responsibility and vent his anger back to guest, even we already agreed to pay the room, but not long after changed decision and Drive us away. The management (include the manager, Gatot) not a words saying apologize, he even turn aways ignoring our talks. And he threat us saying they have police acquaintance to back them up. Whats the connection with police anyway? End notes, is this how you treat your guest? Is this man worthy to be called MANAGER? You are working in hospitality area. Where service and manners the most important, especially in hotel management where people rest, relax and have great feeling."

Yes what you have described : Security of our guests and their belongings is paramount to us, we have conducted thorough investigations and we learned that you put your black jean along with your other clothes in our laundry bag without laundry form. Our team reached out to you to confirm whether you wanted them to be laundered and you said no, so our team did not collect them. On the other hand, no missing clothes were reported in our logbook during your period of stay It was correct but not precisely, on that day i didnt report because i havent found that my belongings were some gone. It was few days after i went back to my home that i found out that fact. The fact about my missing belongings, and actually when i checked again recently it were 2 levi jeans (1 black and 1 light grey). I didnt reported it because i knew that my missing belongings will not come back tough i give the report. I didnt need you to pay for my losses too, i just want to share what happenned in my stayed.
