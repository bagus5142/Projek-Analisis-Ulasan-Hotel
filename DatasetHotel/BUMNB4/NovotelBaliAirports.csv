"1.","Dongjae Lee","40","2025-12-17","5","I had a flight departing at around 1AM, so I checked into this hotel near the airport. The staff were incredibly kind and made the whole check-in process smooth. I was able to rest really well before my flight, which I really appreciated. I also visited the Premium Lounge, and the food was noticeably better compared to other lounges. Special thanks to Ms. Sri Wiyani, who was very friendly and helpful, even accommodating requests for my child. Thank you for everything — it was a great experience and strongly recommend!"
"2.","Cindy Nguyen","46","2025-12-01","5","BEST OPTION if you have an early flight, but not only ! Very warm welcoming. Staff are nice and helpful. The room is great, very clean, big enough. We got a voucher for their lounge and decided to try the tea time one. The food there is nothing special and not great but its still nice experience. The pool is great. We didnt try the gym but it looked nice as well. We went in town for dinner, not too far. Totally recommended"
"3.","LGW","14","2025-12-17","5","We had a lovely experience at the Novotel restaurant. Everything we ordered was very tasty, well prepared, and clearly made with care. The service really stood out. Sri Wiyani took excellent care of us, was attentive and genuinely helpful, and made the whole experience feel warm and easy. We would happily come back and highly recommend it."
"4.","Rana Islamiah Zahroh","28","2025-12-01","5","I had such a good night’s sleep after a long-haul flight, genuinely better than I expected! The bed was super comfy and felt really homey, which is exactly what you need after hours in the air. The staff were all so friendly and genuinely helpful. Breakfast was a surprise too, so many choices, way more than I thought an airport hotel would have! Location-wise, it doesn’t get more convenient than this. It’s just a short walk from both international and domestic terminals, which makes everything so easy. I’ve stayed here three times already, and every stay has been consistently good. It’s honestly one of the best airport hotels I’ve ever stayed at. I’ll definitely come back whenever I have an early flight or need an overnight stay in Bali 🩷❤️"
"5.","Tito Haris","115","2025-12-17","5","I highly recommend Novotel Bali Airport for transit stays, especially for travelers with late international arrivals and early domestic departures. ​Choosing Novotel instead of waiting at the domestic terminal was the right decision. Its location between the terminals is extremely strategic. The 24-hour restaurant (Nasi Goreng Oxtail was excellent!), reliable Wi-Fi, and available Musholla offered great comfort. The only minus is just the AC was turn off. , which i can understand for saving as there is rarely a customers at around 12-1am.. ​The security is top-notch, and the staff service is proactive and excellent. Special thanks to Director Ibu Indri and the team for a safe and comfortable stopover."
"6.","p e","12","2025-12-24","5","Very clean and comfortable hotel to stay at. They always have plenty of staffs available anytime and they’re all really helpful too. Breakfast buffet was also great. Loads of selection to choose from and they actually taste good as well. Thanks to Erika and other lovely staffs for taking care of my table !!"
"7.","preethi rao","8","2025-12-17","2","convenient for flights, but for a four star hotel the service was not up to the mark. the breakfast was not great. towels and bed sheets smelt a little off, we had requested for spoons to eat the food we ordered from room service and they gave us plastic spoons. overall it was fine, we needed a place to stay to get to our flight as soon as possible in the morning so it worked out"
"8.","FEB_Ekonomi Pemb_E2***_1023_Debri Adriana Ndun","2","2025-12-01","5","My short layover in Bali turned out to be a treat thanks to Novotel Bali. The hotel's seamless connection to the airport terminal made it incredibly convenient, saving me from dealing with traffic hassles. The rooms were modern and comfortable, offering just the right amount of space to unwind. But the real highlight was the breakfast buffet - a delightful mix of local and international flavors, beautifully presented and full of surprises. The staff were attentive and friendly, adding to the warm atmosphere. If you're looking for a practical, comfy spot to rest before or after your flight, Novotel Bali is a solid choice. It's not a destination resort, but for ease and comfort, it ticks all the boxes."
"9.","Latisha Dutch","289","2025-10-31","5","I stayed at Novotel Bali Airport for just one night, and it was exactly what I needed — convenient, comfortable, and surprisingly stylish. The biggest plus was the location. Being directly connected to the airport made it incredibly easy for a short stay. I didn’t have to deal with shuttles or taxis — just a quick walk from arrivals, and I was checked in and settled. The staff were wonderful — super friendly, polite, and helpful from start to finish. Everyone I encountered seemed genuinely eager to make sure guests were comfortable. Check-in was smooth, and I appreciated how welcoming the team was even for a quick overnight stay. The hotel itself has a really nice ambience — modern design, clean spaces, and plenty of little photo-worthy spots throughout. I especially enjoyed the fun tech touch of the contactless elevator, where you don’t press buttons but wave your hand to select your floor — a small detail, but one that amused me and felt very on-brand for a modern airport hotel. I also had the breakfast buffet, which was plentiful and fun to explore. There were tons of options — most of them new to me, which made it a bit of an adventure. The food presentation was great, and it offered a nice blend of local and international dishes, even if I didn’t recognize all of them. It’s definitely one of those breakfasts that’s worth waking up for, especially if you enjoy trying something different. Between the convenience of being attached to the terminal, the friendly service, and the relaxing atmosphere, Novotel Bali was exactly what I needed for a short layover. It’s not the kind of place you’d go for a long resort-style stay, but for ease, comfort, and a touch of luxury before or after a flight, it’s absolutely perfect."
"10.","Mark W","44","2025-10-31","4","Nice hotel with great access directly to the international airport. Staff are so friendly and helpful, although the spa staff not so. Lovely pool to relax by although would benefit with a ramp access to the pool area. We saw many people having to carry prams with babies down the steps. Food in the restaurant was great with a good range of food choices on the menu. We will definitely stay again when arriving and departing from the airport."
"11.","Ayla Tan","72","2025-12-17","5","Did a layover and the service staff is fantastic. When I left things behind in the rooms, the staff were very helpful in assisting with the retrieval and did so speedily. Shoutout to Erika at the buffet breakfast session for her attentiveness and great service."
"12.","Nurfatma Perveen","8","2025-10-31","5","Just checked out this morning. Had a nice and easy overnight stay while waiting for my flight. Rooms were clean and getting room service was also easy. Special thanks to Asma and Ifan who handled my check-in. They were really polite and made the check-in process smooth and easy. I also appreciate how the hotel is liked to international terminal. Within 5 minutes of check-out, I was alr in the airport's check-in counter. It's my first time staying with ALL but it won't be the last!"
"13.","Ervina Atan","2","2025-12-17","4","A good transit hotel within close proximity to the international terminal of Ngurah Rai. A good overnight stop if you arrive late in Bali. Standard rooms, nice pool, lovely breakfast. (It’s Indonesia anyway, breakfasts are always fab! 😉) Most of the cheaper alternatives are a short transfer ride away. But if you just want to park for the night after a long haul flight (especially for international travellers out of Asia), this is a good overnight stay before your big Bali retreat or next long haul flight out. (This is based on my review as a seasoned traveller in Indonesia and Nusantara.)"
"14.","jnfd cdsw","4","2025-10-31","5","Very nice hotel, Nice room with a nice comfortable bed not like the other hotels with their hard Asian mattress this one was comfortable. Nice bathroom Nice location withing the airport. you almost don't hear any noise from the airport. Perfect if you wanna spend 1 night before leaving Bali"
"15.","Javkhlan Khajidmaa","2","2025-12-10","5","Great hotel for families! Our room was clean and cozy, the staff were very welcoming, and everything was convenient for travelling with kids. Breakfast was enjoyable and the airport access is extremely easy. Thank you for your warm hospitality, Novotel Bali!”"
"16.","Tina Nand","31","2025-10-31","5","We had the pleasure of staying here for a 6days. We had a wonderful experience the rooms were really modern, clean and very new features. I wanted to thank : Novi From the administration front office she was amazing, she helped us with everything we needed.they actually arrange a little something for my husbands 40th. She good with explaining and understanding exactly what you need during our stay. Erika from the square restaurant was so amazing she was very polite, knew everything we liked and accommodated accordingly. Always going the extra mile. Gede from the rooftop bar was a top notch bartender 👌 he made yummy delicious 😋 cocktails and his service was amazing. Thank you again everyone 💗"
"17.","chantal O’Rourke","3","2025-10-01","4","Great location very practical being at the airport. The dinning, food area is very good and the breakfast buffet is amazing. Staff are so kind and helpful. The rooms were a bit damp smelling but they did their best the fix it. After the rains they have had everything is damp."
"18.","Kylie Cowan","12","2025-10-31","5","We had two separate rooms and on arrival we were offered a joined room which was great! It made our stay heaps easier when sharing suitcases and being able to stay together as a family. We were excited to receive some beautiful little treats in our fridge, and bottled water was supplied. I also enjoyed an excellent massage in the day spa, and had the pool to myself for a relaxing afternoon swim. We had dinner at the rooftop bar with a great sunset, game of pool, and delicious food - stacks of options (tricky to find, some minor directional signage improvements needed). The only thing we didn’t like were the big pillows which made you feel like your neck was being propped up. Bed itself was comfy though:) Friendly staff, so very helpful! It’s about a 30 second walk to international departures, which is connected to the accommodation… you don’t even need to walk outside!"
"19.","Marek Rudzki","8","2025-10-01","5","This hotel offers an excellent experience for us, who were arriving late at night. For instance, we arrived at 1 a.m. after a long-haul flight, and the front desk service was outstanding. A staff member named Sani was especially helpful—he was friendly, professional, and very accommodating, readily available to assist with any requests. His dedication to customer service contributed significantly to a smooth and welcoming stay. Based on this experience, I highly recommend this hotel."
"20.","Rebecca Lucas","4","2025-10-01","5","So convenient. After checking out of our hotel at 12 noon, we used the Novotel's day rate to have a base before our midnight flight. Checked in at 2pm, used their pool, had a drink at their rooftop bar, had showers, relaxed in room before checking out at 8pm. Paid for a suite room which also gave us access to their Premier lounge, so we had snacks and beverages in there too. After checking out, we had dinner in their restaurant before walking straight through to the international departure area of the airport. So convenient and easy."
"21.","Elsty Davidz-Morato","1","2025-12-10","5","Tiba di Ngurah Rai tengah malam dalam perjalanan dinas, beruntung sekali bisa dpt room di Novotel Ngurah Rai Bali. Lokasi yg strategis dalam airport sgt baik utk transit semalam. Ada pengalaman beberapa kali tidak berhasil booking karena hotel fully booked. Room dan service sgt memuaskan. Ada free of charge snacks di minibar di kamar, Sgt membantu utk traveller yg tiba tengah malam dan craving food. Breakfast offer variasi makanan. Staff nya sangat ramah. Salah satu staff, Erika, bahkan melayani dan menawarkan fresh juice yg segar dari buah alami.. Terimakasih"
"22.","mohamed haji","2","2025-12-01","5","I just want share my amazing experience while staying in your hotel. The courteous and warm service with friendly gesture displayed by staff Julia and Nilam was so overwhelmed..Alway smiling and willing and ready to help.. I will definitely come to this hotel with my family for holiday..I will also recommend my friends and other families to come here as well."
"23.","Burak Özkan","19","2025-12-03","3","The rooms are average but relatively clean. Although it’s a hotel located inside the airport, it’s quite far from the city. It’s not ideal for a holiday, but it’s a good option if you’re in transit. The garden is decent, and the food was good."
"24.","Mrs Lobo","11","2025-10-31","3","The perfect place to stay if you have a flight landing or taking off at odd hours in Bali. It’s within walking distance from the airport and has all the facilities you could need — including a spa and express laundry service. They also have nice restaurants and a rooftop bar that serves alcohol, great food, and live music."
"25.","Playa Squirrel","386","2025-08-31","5","One of the nicest airport hotels I've been to. Everyone is super-helpful and speak English (as well as tolerate my rudimentary Indonesian). The breakfast buffet is outstanding (lots of vegetarian options). The room is perfectly fine (I appreciate the tea service and the included bottled water). I really appreciate that you have to request new towels or linens (so eco-friendly!). Spa is lovely and such a treat after the very long trip. Big shout-out to Elly at the front desk for exceptional service!"
"26.","08. I GUSTI PUTU RAEYA KESWANANDA","1","2025-12-27","5","Nginep di Novotel tuh enak dan nyaman. Pelayanannya ramah, kamarnya bersih dan modern, fasilitasnya lengkap, plus sarapannya mantap. Lokasinya juga strategis. Pokoknya worth it buat liburan atau urusan kerja"
"27.","Douglas Morton","5","2025-12-01","4","Great hotel for stopover. Good room and restaurant has large choice. Breakfast was great with so much to enjoy. Atima was very helpful and polite and brightened up our morning. Good luck girl."
"28.","Vaibhav Puri","15","2025-07-31","5","Fantastic Stay Near the Airport! Can’t recommend it highly enough! The location is a major plus, especially if you're flying in or out. It's super close to the airport, making arrivals and departures a breeze. Our room was neat, clean, and well-equipped with all the amenities we could possibly need. The hotel itself is beautifully designed, creating a very pleasant atmosphere. What truly made our stay exceptional was the friendly and welcoming staff. Every interaction was a pleasure. A huge bonus for us was the 24/7 restaurant and bar – incredibly convenient for late-night arrivals or early departures! Honestly, I can't think of a single con. This hotel truly exceeded our expectations. If you're looking for a comfortable, convenient, and welcoming place to stay, especially near the airport, this is absolutely the place to choose."
"29.","Kyuka Lamagu","1","2025-12-03","5","A comfortable atmosphere with easy access between international and domestic. While sitting in the restaurant, I was offered a variety of dishes. The service was friendly, and I ordered the recommended menu from the server, Erika. The food was delicious."
"30.","Stacey Pogorecki","35","2025-12-17","5","Perfect spot for the night before an early flight. The rooftop bar is a great spot for a sunset dinner and to play a bit of pool while listening to live music. Ryo behind the bar was a delight, really looked after us"
"31.","Rats47","250","2025-12-01","5","This hotel have a good choice of breakfast, close to the ibn Batuta mall. And if you want to go the mall of Dubai, you can use metro. The station is really close from the hotel. Perfect place. Also I love to watch the city light from the room."
"32.","L B","7","2025-10-01","4","Staff and service excellent. Appreciate having a hotel that can be safely walked to at night after long day of flying. Great breakfast and lot of variety. Rooms are clean and quiet. Wifi was somewhat problematic in the room although an upgrade was underway and they’d had some issues since recent heavy rains."
"33.","Juan Pablo Riveros","35","2025-10-01","5","Best airport hotel in Bali. Breakfast is very good. A great selection of all cuisines. The Runway bar located on the 4th floor provides great views for plane spotting. I'll book into Bali's Airport Driving range next time! (50 balls are included as part of the hotel's perks)"
"34.","eden fyre","6","2025-07-31","5","Day use for 5 hrs before my late departure flight. Had a great experience with the little time I spent at this location. Friendly staff, clean facilities, beautiful hotel & comfy king size bed. Great if you check in late or for day use. Next time ill do an overnight stay so i can try the breakfast. Overall, amazing and pleasant stay. Would diffinitely be back again. Thank you"
"35.","Aprilia Listiarini","16","2025-10-01","5","I love it! I would def stay here again. The hotel is bright, simple, and the facilities like gym, bar, and restaurant open for 24hours. It’s quite pricey but it’s an airport hotel. The services are great, the staff were treat me nicely even though I’m an Indonesian (local tourist)."
"36.","choi vora","1","2025-10-31","5","It's my first trip to Bali! The flight was delayed by an hour due to the airport strike, so I arrived at 2 a.m. The hotel was next to the airport, so I was able to control my condition. Authentic Indonesian soup and watermelon were delicious, and I could also have iced americano and mixed juice. Candra's skillful response in Korean allowed us to get off to a good start to our first schedule!"
"37.","Lisel Von Duyke","9","2025-10-01","5","The hotel is so great. They are very accommodating and the people who work here are so kind. Our flight was cancelled and we had to stay an extra day with no problems from the hotel. The breakfast is delicious and the pool is very relaxing."
"38.","uliana negrei","3","2025-08-31","5","What a great start to the day! The variety was impressive, catering to different tastes with options from a comprehensive breakfast buffet to freshly made omelettes and local specialities. Also, there were excellent options for all dietary needs, including gluten-free, dairy-free, and vegetarian choices that were easily identified by the little notes under each name of the dish. But the day was made by amazing staff. They were super friendly, helpful, and attentive. They had shown a reall concern about their guest stays in Bali. I will definitely recommend this hotel to friends as well. Thank you to the moon and back."
"39.","Soegianto Ali","381","2025-08-31","5","I reserved for ordinary room but was upgraded to suite. The suite room is of course quite spacious. The hotel was fully booked on that day. The room is very clean. The hotel is well maintained considering it has been there for more than 10 years. They have a rooftop bar with view to the airport runway. Plane spotter will be very happy. The breakfast is quite decent as well with a number of live cooking selection.."
"40.","Myles Salud","1","2025-12-01","4","The hotel is pretty accessible as it’s within the airport. A bit of a walk to get there but overall pretty spacious and the rooms were comfortable. Staff were generally nice and helpful as well"
"41.","Luke Heebner","2","2025-10-31","5","Very easy, great staff especially Erica at the The Sauare restaurant. Good breakfast with good variety. Rooms AC was refreshing, cool and less humid after getting boiled alive in the rest of Bali’s hotels."

"43.","Marije Sluis","25","2025-10-01","4","Perfect hotel in case you have a flight early in the morning. Room is fine, we had views on the runway. Breakfast is amazing. Food from the restaurant was okay, not that special. From the hotel you walk straight into the departure area of the airport which is very convenient."
"44.","jisuk park","3","2025-10-01","4","The location here is very good. The staff is friendly. Breakfast is very good for the price. However, I think we should pay attention to cleanliness. There was a dead cockroach in the room, and it was wandering around at breakfast. If you care about this, it's a very good hotel."
"45.","vicki kennedy","10","2025-10-01","5","Fabulous service great food, buffet breakfast was spectacular. Room was spacious and clean. Very helpful staff even helped us check in for our next flight. Definitely returning."

"47.","Ken Knecht","47","2025-12-01","5","Nice hotel. Short walk to Domestic and/or International terminals. Attached to airport. Good for one night. Just like upscale Courtyard Marriott are the rooms."
"48.","laith harb","20","2025-12-01","5","I love this hotel so much, even thought its literally inside the airport, but you will not feel it. Its so relaxing to be there, beautiful gym, amazing food and great spa, i loved their spa services, the staff were so friendly and nice, and their services are top notch, i really recommend the massage."
"49.","Kelly Rey","24","2025-12-10","5","The breakfast and the stay were absolutely great, the service and attention from Sri Wiyani was amazing in the buffet, making sure everything was perfect and we were not missing anything. Recommended 100%"
"50.","Clair Hales","22","2025-10-01","5","Awesome place for 1 night before or after a flight. Dinner and breakfast were great. Saved a lot of stress not being in the Bali traffic. Very quick and easy walk to international departures"
"51.","Rauf ardani","30","2025-12-01","5","Kesini krn ada rapat tapi ngga nginep. Lokasi nempel airport n jalur petunjuknya jelas. 10 mnt lah jalan kaki santai. Kalau diliat2, Dia di tengah2 airport domestik n international deh."
"52.","Dandy Prijatna","8","2025-12-01","5","Everything in Novotel is great!! my room gets a free upgrade to an exclusive room because of the intern problem between staff. The room is clean, tv and wifi work so good, the breakfast is absolutely delicious. 9/10"
"53.","Jeremiah jones","3","2025-12-01","5","Stayed here for one night but still had an amazing time, the staff where very professional and friendly, especially from the security guard Anang Nanda who gave us a very warm welcome in and gave us local knowledge on all the good spots. 100% would recommend and I will definitely be coming back here next time."
"54.","Gee M","1","2025-07-31","5","Booked the Day Stay. It was recommended to us and I thought I would give it a go instead of battling traffic to get to airport. Wow, what can I say. I will be booking this every trip from now on and recommending it. Lovely room, comfortable beds, shower was great, lovely food at restaurant and we even had a drink or two at the Runway Bar. Didn't go for a swim as we ran out of time - next time perhaps"
"55.","Susan Cameron","2","2025-08-31","3","Can't beat location if you have a very early flight. Unfortunately though it was an uncomfortable stay. We booked this hotel to give ourselves and extra few hours of sleep before our long flight. This didn't happen as the room was so hot even though the air-conditioning unit said it was set to cool 18⁰ no one in our family slept a wink. Really made our flight then unbearable. Additionally one of the housekeeping staff walked into our room without knocking whilst my partner was in the shower. He was shocked that we were in the room then proceeded to ask if we needed our sheets changed which made no sense as we checked-in only 20 minutes earlier."
"56.","Jiten Tibrewala","41","2025-07-31","5","Novotel Bali Airport is the ideal choice for transit or late-night arrivals — you simply can’t beat the location, with direct access from the terminal! Check-in was smooth, and the staff were incredibly welcoming, helpful, and professional throughout our stay. The rooms are clean, comfortable, and well-equipped for a restful stopover. But the highlight has to be the rooftop bar — a hidden gem offering beautiful runway views, refreshing drinks, and a relaxed atmosphere to unwind after a flight. Highly recommended for convenience, comfort, and the exceptional service that makes even a short stay memorable."
"57.","Chel O","147","2025-07-01","5","Loved our stay! Friendly staff. So close to airport (can literally walk straight into the departures area). Comfy beds, delicious breakfast with great variety. Our room had complimentary access to the premier lounge which was also great - free food, girl math ;) Which also had delicious food. Make sure to check out the runway bar with great views of all of the planes taking off and landing. Will definitely stay again next time we come to Bali :)"
"58.","Marie Hortis","12","2025-10-01","5","Excellent location for a transit hotel. Overnight stay at this hotel as our flight atrived very late. The staff were friendly and welcoming. The beds were super comfortable as were the pillows. The breakfast staff were lovelt however breakfast options were limited but still wonderful. We didn't use the piol bit it looked good."

The room was comfortable, and I could rest well before starting my trip. During breakfast, Candra was very kind and made the experience even better. Thank you for a great start to my Bali journey!"
"69.","Shannon Smith","310","2025-08-31","4","Flew in from Adelaide two weeks ago. Airport is quite nice. If you are unfortunate enough to not have done your visa online prior to arrival the wait for this can be horrendous, especially if you are arriving with other international flights ( i waited almost 2 hours)."

"73.","Jan Clo","2","2025-10-31","2","So disappointing! Beware the customer service of this Novotel who refused to cancel a double booking made by mistake, even though it was notified 2 months before stay. Offered no alternative, such as upgrade, change of date or a refund if the room was rebooked. When we arrived, the hotel was fully booked and our second room they listed as a no-show. An expensive mistake by us, but surely the Novotel could have accepted another booking and canceled ours."

"84.","NnNn","33","2025-07-31","4","Great hotel, my only negative, is a serious one for safety - in the corridors they have decorative panels that have large open gaps at the bottom that would easily fit a child who might be inquisitive and crawl through and fall straight down to the level below. I know we should all watch out kids but kids are quick and tbh it doesn’t look immediately unsafe until you look through and see the drop. See the photo. This I think needs attention, just a clear panel behind to block access. Otherwise fantastic hotel and the rooftop bar with the tarmac views is outstanding. Pool was freezing!"

"86.","Trent Patterson","12","2025-10-31","5","$50 dollars each to use all the facilities while we waited for a late flight. Worth every cent. And you get the $50 as a credit to use in the restaurant there. Perfect"

Kamar bersih dan nyaman, meskipun agak sempit untuk ukuran keluarga. Fasilitas seperti AC, TV, dan air panas berfungsi dengan baik. Sarapan cukup variatif dan rasanya lumayan. Staf hotel ramah dan sigap membantu kebutuhan tamu. Area parkir terbatas, jadi agak merepotkan jika datang dengan mobil pribadi. Suasana hotel tenang dan cocok untuk istirahat. Harga sesuai dengan fasilitas yang didapat. Secara keseluruhan, hotel ini layak dijadikan pilihan untuk menginap saat di bali."

"99.","Stefanie P.","159","2025-07-31","5","If you’re wondering whether this Novotel is worth it when you’re stuck at the airport with seven hours to kill before a 17-hour flight - yes it is - it is a good place to recover from poor life choices… like trusting your husband to book flights and remember the exact time. In the hotel you’ll find friendly staff, cool air, a nice pool area and very good food (lamb, chocolate lava cake, tiramisu). The daypass is worth it, as it ends dragging luggage through the terminal like lost souls. As you enjoy a surprisingly good tiramisu, your mind might wander to all the things you could have been doing during those seven hours, slowly realising that you should enjoy the moment and order a nice coconut. Sipping your coconut, you’ll find yourself thinking about future plans—and realizing that maybe you don’t really need a child soon, since it feels like you’re already with one. Fortunately, Novotel also has a small area in the pool for children. Highly recommended."

I called them and was told I didn’t need to go through immigration and it was connected to the international departure area. This was not the case so I attempted to get a refund and they denied the refund request. If I was told one thing and that wasn’t true then why should I have to pay for a room that I never stayed in?"

Last Month was our 4th stay at Novotel Bali Ngurah Rai Airport, thought our stay was relative short for Arrival and departure from Bali,but it became one of my favorite Accor Property in Bali. The Staff are friendly and efficient, request by email as accor member or (not) were fast and quick to get the answers, appreciate once they prepare the room for Birthday surprise with cake! The room are comfortable , soundproof tho inside airport terminal you rarely hear any sound of take off and landing. Breakfast are good, easy to get taxis , the connecting area direct to check in counter are the higlight! Transfer to domestic terminal just minutes away! Oh and the Spa!! Recomended! see you in few months Novotel Bali Ngurah Rai AirPort!"
"112.","Karen Enright","26","2025-10-31","5","With a midnight arrival it was wonderful just to go to our room. Think the signage at the airport needs to be more obvious though as we were going round in circles for some time."
"113.","Miky Stefani","13","2025-08-31","5","I always have a wonderful experience with Novotel Ngurah Rai Airport’s pick-up service, especially with Aditya Loban. He has personally picked me up and taken me to the airport gate several times, and each time I’ve felt truly welcomed and cared for. His warm smile, helpful nature, and professionalism make all the difference, especially when traveling can be stressful. I highly recommend his services — thank you, Aditya Loban, for always starting and ending my trips on such a positive note!"
"114.","Sadik A.S. Jamal","42","2025-10-01","5","Novotel Ngurah Rai is located inside the Airport just across International Departures, 2 minutes walk from the check-in gates! Very convenient hotel on transit or shorts stays to visit Kuta or nearby attractions. The premises are quite clean and modern, with very friendly and helpful staff. Breakfast is good both for European and Asian guests. The executive lounge (available for Accor members, is quiet and offers Snack bites from 12:00 -15:00, tea from 15:00-17:00 and cocktail from 17:00-22:00. They also have a flight lounge on the top floor, where you can enjoy a drink while viewing the airport runway. Thanks to all the staff for their friendly approach and readiness to help. Especially appreciation to Mr. Indra Semara (Excecutive Assistant Manager) for personally welcoming me and my wife and showing us the main areas of the hotel. My Accor Status was immediately recognized and all privileges conceded, including an upgrade to a suite, which was quite comfortable. There is an ATM machine just on the way to the terminal, which is very convenient. The bar and restaurant are ample, and had live music at dinner time, which was a surprise. Strongly recommend this hotel to anyone with a layover in Denpasar."

"117.","Deb G","5","2025-07-01","2","Just some feedback ahead of our stay in 2 days - if your system allows to book a Superior room for 2 adults and 1 child (up to age 16 as per your website), the hotel should supply a bed/cot for the child. Being advised 3 days before check-in that we'll have to share a bed with our young child as rollaway beds are only for Suites (which are now sold out), is not OK. My partner will now have to sleep on the floor, which after a long day of travelling and paying AUD$168 for the night, will put a dampener on the start of our holiday. If bed sharing is the only solution for this situation, you need to update your system instead of inconveniencing your guests."

Walking distance from the arrivals, but there was no signs and Google Maps provided no real help trying to find our way there. The pool area was lovely and the restaurant is pricey but open 24/7 if you arrive late. Breakfast was lovely. Reception was not manned when we arrived super late and tired, gym was only a room without aircon and only small weights, and our room could have used a proper deep clean. Closet doors were held together with tape."

"184.","Sarah Denzel","37","2024-12-31","5","Stayed here for our last night in Bali for proximity to the airport. So happy we chose this place. Really nice clean rooms, comfortable bed, amazing blackout curtains. The pool is huge and my son had so much fun in it. We really enjoyed all the choices for breakfast and service was so nice. 24 hour room service was a bonus. Also, it was great just to walk into the airport stress free the next afternoon. The only negatives, not sure why you have to pay for each transaction separately and can't just put a credit card on file and pay for all purchases at once when you check out. I was super excited to see the spa open until 11pm. I booked an hour and a half package and unfortunately it was pretty subpar for paying like at least 4 times more than what you can get out of the hotel. I asked for more pressure and never got it, felt like just barely pressing into my skin and at one point while getting my supposed reflexology on my feet, she was sitting in a chair and I'm pretty sure she either fell asleep (it was after 10pm) or was stopping to check a phone maybe. She would keep a hand on my foot but then would stop moving slower and slower then completely stop and not move for like 30 seconds to a minute before doing it over again. That went on for at least 15 minutes of the 30 minutes. So other than the spa, I highly recommend this hotel!"

"203.","Kaamil Gaffar","80","2024-12-31","5","Had a wonderful stay in this hotel with great staff an amazing breakfast for such a low cost! And a beautiful pool. Gym could be a bit bigger but it's manageable for a quick workout. Location is amazing with loads of restaurants just downstairs by the airport, lots of ATMs and have a great executive lounge with nice cocktail snacks and food facing the airport runways. Great place for a quick stay."

"209.","Renee Taitimu","13","2025-05-31","5","We stayed here the night before leaving bali. This location was ideal. I booked an extra night just in case we had delays it is only a short walk to the airport, and there is no need to rush to check in the food at the restaurant is amazing the service is top-notch I highly recommend staying here before flying out of Bali 😊"
"210.","Eunice roussel","4","2024-12-31","5","The service is incredible, I had such a pleasant and relaxing time. A staff so loving and pleasant and very attentive. I was taken care of at the bottom of the hotel by a hotel agent named ANANG, who helped me and explained, who took care of my suitcases, explained the operation and took me to the reception, an agent with a lot of professionalism, kindness, listening. I highly recommend it. For the first time in Bali, being surrounded and welcomed by a person who puts you so confident and who help you is very rare. I recommend it and I recommend this hotel for its welcome and professionalism. Thank you very much for everything! ❤️"
"211.","Pam Hullinger","107","2024-12-31","5","This hotel, its staff, service, amenities, restaurant and location all deserve more than 5 stars. It is so conveniently located a short walk from the terminals at the airport. The rooms were very clean and comfortable the restaurant had a wonderful variety of food choices at very reasonable prices. Generous portions. All of my friends staying here during a 1 night stop over were very impressed (all 24 of them). I wish every airport had such an ideal choice for a night stay while in transit. Wish I had taken some pics to share."

"217.","Greg Bassett","125","2024-12-31","5","This hotel was both surprisingly affordable and a very nice place to stay. It is a very short walk from both domestic and international terminals. The room was very clean and modern. Being connected to the airport means you can avoid the increasingly bad Bali traffic after or just before a long flight. Also important is the very inexpensive breakfast buffet. It is one of the largest I have seen, but priced far below other major hotels and locations. We also ate dinner there and the food was very good. The service lost a star because the room was missing towels (which were delivered quickly) and the front desk staff were good but certainly not excellent. We will absolutely stay here again during our next Bali visit."

We had 2 rooms for 3 adults and 1 child which were perfect! So handy having multiple universal power points in rooms!! Awesome pool with great mix of sun and shade, amazing selection for breakfast (kids loved the ice-cream machine and donut tree) also loved plane spotting from the rooftop bar! Great location... right at the international airport and only a short walk to busy Kuta area!"

Have nice variety of food However, the rooms can get more clean Washrooms had the dirt lying on the shower area. Needs deep cleaning I informed while checkout about the flies and the bugs in the rooms. These flies are only around the dirt. Means the rooms were not cleaned"

"228.","Lauren Hill","166","2023-12-31","5","Stayed here for one night as we arrived super late in the morning. Offered tea and water complimentary on arrival and had a surprise cake in the room waiting (was on honeymoon). Room was comfy, got our bags taken down by the porter which was nice. Had a lovely shower in the morning, enjoyed a stunning breakfast buffet and enjoyed a rest by the pool before checking out. Pool was clean, restaurant was clean, everything was lovely. It's also worth mentioning it was a very easy walk from the arrival area in the airport. Would recommend and will stay again on our next visit"
"229.","Mick Olsen","29","2024-12-31","4","Great place to bunk down after a late night arrival in Bali or the night prior to an early departure. Close and easy to locate, rooms are well soundproofed with no airport noise detectable. Room was neat and tidy and beds were comfy. Breakfast was great."

"238.","Angela Munise","40","2024-12-31","5","Staff at this hotel is AMAZING! Everyone we encountered from the front desk to the servers were super friendly and eager to accommodate! The location is immediately next to the airport but not something you could walk to. We had to hire a taxi for $120rp to get there."
"239.","Claire Waterfront","10","2024-12-31","5","Location: The hotel is in the middle of airport. Facility: Pool itself is a small garden itself. Cons: smoking area is near. Roof top bar: Can enjoy the Bay Area view especially during sunset. Staff: All staff are delighted and one step forward to help customers. I would like to appreciate ANDRE for impeccable help. When I tried to order GRAB, all delivery drivers said, I had to come to the airport parking lot, which takes 10 mins by walk from hotel. But today when I passed by entrance, he caught that I was going to the parking lot for pick-up GRAB, and assisted me a phone conversation with driver to come to hotel lobby."
"240.","Tracy Andersen","48","2024-12-31","4","This hotel is perfect for early morning fly outs or late arrivals. Rooms are clean and quiet and we included breakfast in our booking, which was fresh and a good selection of choices. The roof top bar provided nice views of planes coming and going and a pool table, live music when we were there and good selection of drinks with complimentary nuts. This hotel is our go to as a stay the night before fly out."

The breakfast buffet was a delightful spread of delicious options, catering to various dietary preferences. The quality of the food was outstanding, with fresh ingredients and a wide array of choices. Whether I wanted a hearty English breakfast or a light and healthy option, the restaurant had it all. The attentive staff ensured prompt service and were always ready to accommodate any special requests. Moving on to the room, it was immaculate. The housekeeping staff did an exceptional job of maintaining cleanliness throughout my stay. The moment I entered the room, I was greeted by a refreshing scent and a spotless environment. The bed was comfortable with crisp linens, and the attention to detail in terms of cleanliness was evident."
"244.","Yonggeun Choi","46","2025-07-01","4","I think it's the best accommodation for flights arriving at night. The downside is that the walking path is a bit hot and long."
"245.","Laura Rees","18","2025-05-01","2","Smelt, no vibe whatsoever, rooms were not cleaned, you could tell sheets hadn't been changed either, other people's hair all over them. Gross. Empty bottles left behind it just wasn't nice at all. $15 just for the cab to drop you there. Only worth it for the super early morning flights out."
"246.","Ryan Samia","6","2024-12-31","5","First time to check-in Novotel Bali Ngurah Rai Airport and the hotel is attached to the airport with easy access to the International and Domestic Terminal. The rooms are clean and modern. Lots of sitting area in the lobby as well. There are many food options when you go out of the hotel and before you enter the Domestic terminal. There is also a pool and a spa in the hotel. It's just like paradise beside the airport."

"251.","Ahmad Obeid","206","2023-12-31","3","Great location, walking distance from the airport but could be tricky to find. Ideal if you are transiting for another flight. Service is friendly all around the hotel. Room is not extra clean, there are a few spots I found on towels which is concerning to me. Breakfast is good but not great, I think you can get better food just outside. The 3 star rating is because I asked them to extend check out time by 1 hour and they wanted to charge me almost half room rate for that. Usually it is the right of the hotel not to extend free of charge, but given that I checked in at 3 am, and the hotel occupancy was apparently low, I expected some consideration."
"252.","Jo Mccoy","9","2024-12-31","5","10 out of 10 for reception staff. Daniel gave us a warm welcome after our long day of travel. Then a young man working the following morning was equally friendly and helpful getting us sorted with domestic check in. Yes it is a bit expensive but totally worth it for the clean, spacious rooms and convenience of being right at the airport. Wonderful start to our Indo adventure."

"256.","Mohit Mehtaji","468","2024-12-31","5","Would recommend for transmitting and connectivity to airport. Great hotel connected to the airport. When you exit baggage claim it is a bit of a walk and you have to go all the way out where folks are waiting with name signs. Follow the direction to the transit hotel and it will take you through a parking garage and another hallway that seems out of place but is not. The staff was great and friendly and check in was smooth. There is a restaurant and bar on site and is open 24/7 - prices are reasonable - food was ok but we only ordered apps. We only stayed the night as we were in transit but the hotel site seems worth she explore. What we made out was certain gardens by the pool - the pool seemed great too but we never used it. You can however walk to the airport area for other restaurants - the connectivity is amazing. Wi-Fi is great too through out the hotel. If you are travelling after your stay the hotel has its own entrance into the international terminal which leads you to the check in counters within seconds. You can’t beat this. That being said get to the airport early specially for morning flights."

We were travelling as a couple with a 17 month old and wanted to get her into bed asap so we could all get some rest. Plan worked perfectly !! This hotel was absolutely wonderful - convenient location meant we could just roll our trolleys with luggage from airport to hotel via a convenient passage way. Room was lovely, clean and spacious, great shower and super comfy bed. Decent breakfast and friendly staff. Couldn’t ask for more !"

I had access to the premium lounge where you could eat while planespotting. You can planespot at the rooftop at 4.00 PM. Overall I had a great experience staying here. 5/5!"

The ones we have now are a little old and grey. I wish they were white and fluffy. The in-room massage is amazing. I booked twice in one day but it is very disruptive that they don't allow you to bill it to the room. Instead, they made me get up and pay. I wanted to just stay in bed and sleep. Would be perfect if they allow it to be billed together when we check out. Food at restaurant was superb. Fantastic service as well!"

We found on our first leg of our journey a month ago (we stayed for three nights) and the hotel exceeded our expectation. And again for two nights to relax before our flight home to New Zealand/Aotearoa. Throughout our stays, we found that all the staff are really attentive, polite and friendly. Staff and management done five star plus jobs in attending to our needs and nothing is a bother, i.e Mr Mukhlis assist in securing additional stays for us that fits with our fluid itinerary and make our travel plan so much easier. The breakfast buffet have a huge selection and all taste are catered for. The staff in the restaurant is very courteous and friendly, ready to makes us feel welcome, especially miss Sri Budi and miss Sri wiryanti. Pool facility are top class and have beautiful ambiance. We would definitely love to stay here again"

"298.","Chrissie MacLean","108","2024-12-31","1","The grossest hotel I have ever stayed in. Honestly, the room smelt of stale cigarettes, the carpet was torn and stained, the sheets were cheap synthetic material, the bed left me with a sore back and the bathroom was grotty. Breakfast was okay, decent variety but nothing special. The best thing is the location when you have a super late or early flight but do yourself a favour and take a 2 minute taxi ride down the road to the Hilton Garden Inn which is a million times better in every way and somehow cheaper. I’m absolutely baffled as to how this disgusting hotel had such a high rating."
"299.","Muhammad Shofiyulloh","2","2023-12-31","5","Very comfortable hotel!!! Especially for transit. Located very close to the airport but not heard of the roar of the planes at all. There is a view of the sea and gwk from a distance. The check process was very fast, immediately put the suitcases in the hotel room. The check out process was fast too. Fast service and very friendly employees. The room is clean and the bed linen pillows smell nice. Good food and cheap. If you want to go for a short walk, you can rent a car from here, it's great to be rich again. Vacation, even though I'm just here in transit because the next day I fly to Aussie.....and there is a connecting road from the hotel to international departures."
"300.","cel","7","2023-12-31","5","Had an amazing time here during my stay. The breakfast buffet was really good. The ambience and environment feels very comfortable and the swimming pool, garden looks so beautiful. What a view! The lobby ambassador, Chandra Dwi was really friendly and checked up on us on our experience here. She's really patient and welcoming. Thank you!!"
"301.","Aggie Sobol","56","2023-12-31","5","We had an unexpectedly wonderful stay at this airport hotel. We arrived very late but restaurant was 24 hours so we were able to get a meal and some drinks. Food was affordably priced and made with love. Our rooms were so comfortable, the shower had good pressure and there was plenty of space and ammenities. The beds offered a great nights sleep with soft cotton linen and supportive mattresses. The breakfast buffet had plenty of options including new to us things to try for the first time. All staff we came into contact with were absolutely lovely. Recommend highly!"
"302.","Robert Ransome","12","2024-12-31","5","On our visits to Bali whenever we have a late arrival or early departure flight we book into the Airport Novotel. We have always been impressed with the service we receive and the appreciation of my husband's Accor platinum status and this last visit was no exception. Dewa greeted us on arrival and was extremely courteous and helpful. It was great to be able to relax in the Executive Lounge whilst waiting for our room to be ready as we were early. Emi in the Executive Lounge was delightful. She is quietly efficient and always ready to offer service. We were impressed with the food and beverage available in the lounge - more then we expected. Rooms are comfortable and clean. We would like to thank Windy on check out who was most accommodating and helpful. All in all another excellent stay. Thank you to all the team for making it such a pleasant one. We will be back for sure!"

"305.","Anna Roiser","23","2023-12-31","4","Good for our needs - a one night stopover between flights. Pool was nice, spa was good and dinner was tasty. Despite being at the airport you don't hear the planes in your room - very good sound-proofing. Loses a star because it was the only place we stayed in six weeks in Indonesia that made you pay for drinking water (after a free small bottle in the room) - despite being quite expensive."
"306.","Divya Gupta","12","2024-12-31","1","Poor location and poor room with no day light . I found ant in room . While checking hotel claims that if u lost the key or any towel and has stain , they will charge half a million in there currency. It is such a big brand of hotel and by saying this I feel this doesn’t make sense ."
"307.","Auldrick Brown","295","2022-12-31","5","Good location, essentially connected to the airport, so it's very convenient especially for overnight or short stay guests, but also for longer stays. Friendly and respectful staff. Small gym but has enough for a workout on the go. The surroundings are sufficiently green and curated that sometimes you don't get that airport feel, you would think you're elsewhere. Restaurant and room service are all good and prices are reasonable."
"308.","shaun koh","18","2024-12-31","2","It’s a four star hotel in intent, but 2 star in execution. I just checked in. My hotel room is filthy: there’s what appears to be blood stains / bodily fluids on the headboard, bed frame, and carpet. If someone was killed in here, you owe it to your customers to deep clean it. At least the bed linens are clean. I thought this would be the well maintained airport hotel their google reviews suggest they are. Considering their price premium, maybe I got a lemon, but it is already systemic process failure that customers would need to vet the basic cleanliness and hygiene of their rooms for them. I’m glad I’m leaving in a few hours."
"309.","Mark Chase","338","2022-12-31","5","We had an 8 hour layover. It was very relaxing to be able to check into a room for 6 of those hours and take a quick shower and nap. The room was clean, quiet and affordable. The staff were friendly and got us checked in pretty quickly. Being in the International terminal a short way from our gate was a nice treat."
"310.","catherine suwardi","5","2023-12-31","5","The location was convenient, situated close to public transportation and within walking distance of various attractions. It made exploring the city hassle-free and saved me time and money on commuting. Though the room was compact, it was clean, well-maintained, and had all the essential amenities needed for a comfortable stay. The bed was cozy, providing a good night's sleep after a day of sightseeing."
"311.","Nugi Antara","2","2025-10-31","5","Clean room and good breakfast before flight"
"312.","Danielle Couch","27","2023-12-31","4","This hotel was just what we needed, arriving late at night after a long flight. Check in was very easy and friendly. Although there could have been better signage walking from the airport as we wandered around but lots of friendly locals sent us the right way! After a good sleep, we were welcomed to a good buffet breakfast. I particularly liked the noodle soup, with great stock and my son was a fan of the doughnuts. Chandra Dwi, the breakfast host, was very helpful and friendly, all all the other staff answered queries with a smile"

"314.","sp hp","229","2023-12-31","3","Good for transfers and transits. While the room was acceptable, a few minor issues. Was greeted by a tray of disposed food at the entrance of our room when we checked in, not sure how that happened. Hair dryer had exposed wires. Shower area does not have a door, so the sink area gets wet after a shower. And as it is a airport hotel, need to walk to the domestic or international terminals to get a cab if you wanna travel."
"315.","Adrien Castera","101","2023-12-31","3","Location is not very convenient except if you just need to stay by the airport. Rooms are dark as window gives to the swimming pool and everyone can see in. Food is good but I consider this just a transient hotel. Forget about going for a walk outside, the place is a maze. Good rooftop bar but place is dead on most nights."
"316.","Stephanie Miller","23","2024-12-31","5","Stayed at Novotel on my way out of Bali. turns out, i got stuck during the global shut down of airline computers. not a huge deal, i just booked a massage! was able to extend my stay easily. entire experience was great."
"317.","Marcus Tanner","47","2024-12-31","5","If you have to transit in Denpasar and want to avoid the potential nightmare that can be Bali's traffic, this is a great hotel. It has a prime position mid-way between the international and domestic terminals and is a very easy walk (less than 10 minutes) to both. The in-house restaurant has some good options, and the breakfast is great. The Runway Bar (which, as the name suggests, overlooks the main runway) is worth a look but can be a little tricky to find. The food court / shopping area opposite the domestic terminal has other dining options. Fantastic service from staff."
"318.","James Mahoney","15","2024-12-31","5","We arrived in Bali at 9:30pm and decided to stay at the Novotel Airport as it would have been too late to organise transportation to a hotel. The hotel is located next to the airport and was a short walk from the arrivals gate to the hotel lobby. We were greeted by the Front Office Manager, Ifan Taufan, who was extremely welcoming. Now, I’ve travelled a lot and stay in plenty of Accor properties (Gold member) and I can say with certainty that I have never been greeted by a Front Office manager on arrival. It was refreshing to see upper management be involved with their guests. We were upgraded to a suite for the night and shown to our room by a porter who helped with our luggage. The room was huge and the member amenity was a dessert platter. That was delicious. Breakfast in the morning was some of the best we’ve had in Asia. Highly recommend. For such a brief stay, this hotel really made an impression on us. Highly recommend staying here for the night if you arrive late or have an early departing flight from the airport. Well done, team."
"319.","Cody","180","2024-12-31","3","These reviews must be false, because by Australian standards this hotel is exceptionally average. The rooms have insects from the dampness, breakfast buffet subpar, and the service pretty slow in attentive. Wouldn’t come back."
"320.","Apoorva","289","2025-01-31","5","Stayed here for a night as our flight reached late at night. The hotels entrance was tricky to find but the service at the hotel made up for that! Good stay."
"321.","Rob Luginbuhl","97","2024-12-31","5","A few minutes walk from the airport entrance, so very convenient. Many amenities, the indoor spaces are very well done with a taste of local character. The breakfast offers many choices. The room was very nice."
"322.","Malcolm Reasons","12","2023-12-31","5","The hotel is an easy, short walk from the arrivals hall at Bali airport. I was approached at check in by Ifan Taufan, who greeted me warmly and checked me in, thanking me for my loyalty (I know, as they all do now) and noting my room request (high floor, runway view). He offered me a choice of ‘second best’ available immediately or his recommended ‘first choice’ if I was happy to wait a short while. I opted for ‘first choice’ and he then invited me to enjoy the club lounge and all its facilities while I waited for my room. He introduced me to his colleagues in the lounge and he and they all made me feel very welcome. I was delighted with my room. It was comfortable, clean, everything worked well (wifi, sockets, shower etc) and the view (of the runway) was exactly what I hoped for. Breakfast each day was delicious. A huge range of food & drink to satisfy every taste. Dinner was also good, whether buffet (some evenings) or à la carte. Pool and gym facilities were also good and all public areas were clean and well presented. Before I left, a huge Christmas display was set up in the reception area, with Santa Claus (well, 3 of them, in fact!), plus a sleigh and reindeers. The kids loved it! The only small criticism I might have is that the Christmas music became somewhat tedious after while. On the day of leaving, I was offered late checkout if I needed it, but left mid-morning. Ifan handled my check out, hoping I’d had a pleasant stay and wishing me well. Everything about my stay was perfect. All staff were extremely polite and helpful and showed warm familiarity and laughed and joked with me once they’d begun to recognise me. I can’t praise this hotel and its staff highly enough. Thank you to Ifan and his colleagues - they all do a wonderful job. I’ll definitely be back!"

The rooms were well-appointed, providing a relaxing and peaceful atmosphere. The hotel's facilities, including the swimming pool and fitness center, added to the overall experience. I highly recommend Novotel Bali Airport Hotel for its convenience, stellar service, and comfortable accommodations."
"324.","Xelcius","953","2022-12-31","5","It is a little difficult to find the hotel because you need to pass through parking lot. but the people around were super friendly to guide us there. The customer service in the hotel was friendly and good. the food was good too. the room was clean but end up I noticed there was a molded area in the wardrobe near the ceiling. but it was okay as it didn't cause the room smelly."
"325.","Hanh Nguyen","102","2023-12-31","4","Good hotel for the price. Recommend the spa as hidden behind the garden walk but very nice reasonable price services. The staff is nice and helpful. The room is clean. Just the entrance to this hotel is not the usual hotel entrance, gotta find the way and walk through some dark quiet up and down walk way. Not ideal if you have many suitcases."
"326.","Samantha Jane","35","2023-12-31","5","Nice clean rooms. Good food menu. Great if you have the late flight in do you can start your trip rested. Beds are hard if that’s something of an issue for you, but they tend to be everywhere."

"330.","Cindy","65","2024-12-31","1","booked around 11 rooms for 8 and 9 april 2024 through the hotel's reservation team via email. the service from the reservation team was horrible, I didn't get any reply so I had to keep calling them through phone, almost like BEGGING to reply my email. I had to beg them to send me their bank account because I want to do the payment but they ignored me for days. I decided to contact them via whatsapp but they remain ignorant and slow. I have expressed my dissapointment directly through email and whatsapp yet they didn't seem to care I have sent the rooming list which includes the flight detail of each person because they are arriving at different times, yet they keep asking me to send the rooming list and flight details several times. the tone of their voice (the reservation team) didn't sound quite nice either on the phone. judging from their attitude, it seems to me that they don't need any clients so I will never go back to this hotel again."
"331.","Rama Kolkman","14","2024-12-31","1","Quite disappointed that even though had a cancellation of no refund but sometimes a medical emergency that cant be controlled. They wont even consider a 50% refund. So just be aware of this issue for those who decides to do any booking in the future. Would like to add and as you can see nothing to rectify the issue further. All I get is an apology. I will definitely not stay here in the future if this is the kind of damage control they give. The best would be provide a contact email or whatsapp. So that I can contact you guys to explain the situation. But nothing very poor quality of service."

All praise to the hotel staff, they do a good job; shame to the chef who didn’t use the hygienic working methods."
"335.","Dan Nguyen","27","2023-12-31","5","We stayed here on our first night in Bali since we landed late. The hotel was nice and clean and is basically attached to the airport, which is nice after a long flight. We also took advantage of the day use on our last day in Bali since we had a late departure. Highly recommend using the day pass if you have time and want to stay away from the heat!"
"336.","Sivamathuran Sivaraman","5","2023-12-31","2","My wife and I were a bit disappointed in this hotel. Despite reading all the positive reviews before we booked, we found the hotel to be run down and not up to standard in terms of cleanliness. As we were staying for one night, we didn't bother to provide any comments to the staff. The main negatives- we noticed the towels, sheets, pillow cases and carpet had stains. The pillow itself was also stained a dark yellow colour! The positives- the staff were very friendly and the breakfast was decent. Compared to other Novotel Hotels (such as the one next to Athens airport) this hotel was run down and not the same quality."
"337.","Andreas Graf","35","2024-12-31","4","The hotel itself is nice and clean. Locationwise, it's an airport hotel, so pool and recreational facilities are on the low side. Breakfast buffet has a good mix of international and local options."

The hotel itself is very quiet and it's not as lively as it used to before the pandemic. Only a couple of staff, but they are so nice and helpful.

Standard quality and amenities, but the room rate is above the other hotels just outside the airport. However, Novotel Ngurah Rai had definitely changed my mind. The level of comfort, service, ambiance was really higher than the money I had paid. The hospitality of the staff was also excellent. I cant think of a single thing to complain about. Plus, the location is just next to the Domestic arrival and connected to the International Departure. There are also Solaria, Pizza Hut and Starbucks if you plan to have short meeting with friends. Perfect!!"

"359.","J M","77","2023-12-31","1","I’m staying for 1 night due to late flight out after my holiday. The renovated rooms seem fine enough but I’m warning everyone there’s major issues with cleanliness. The disgusting stains in the carpet are so common that it seems like a joke, every square foot has MULTIPLE stains in it - I’m talking dozens of stains. Additionally the carpet seems to have not been vacuumed in over a week, little bits of debris everywhere. When I got into the shower I freaked out thinking there was a spider on my towel only to see it was a wad of hair hanging off the neatly folded towel on the rack. What other things have I not noticed if this is so glaringly obvious? The towels are so dingy they look like they’re supposed to be beige colour. Why does this hotel not offer wash cloths? For a king size room you get 2 small bath towels and 1 hand towel. That’s it. The wifi was so spotty, I couldn’t go more than a few minutes before I had to manually reconnect. Not acceptable in 2023. ***Read through some of the reviews, there’s multiple that are word for word the same. Copy & paste. Not sure what kind of positive review games are going on but it’s definitely sus. Would not recommend."

"366.","K Vds","14","2023-12-31","4","Very close to the airport so perfect if you don't want to travel far before or after your flight. The rooms could be a little cleaner however, the surface was clean, but the details weren't. Would stay here again because of the close proximity to the airport."
"367.","Adrian Teo","11","2023-12-31","5","Great experience as I had a flight to catch later in the afternoon and it was a great option next to the airport. 7 mins walk and was able to get a good package for 3 hours. Very professional and wonderful experience. Thanks to Sugi and her professionalism, I had a great rest prior to my flight!! Thank you and will be back again."
"368.","Nudita Rusdiani","149","2022-12-31","5","It has been awhile since our last visit. This hotel still has the best feeling of transitioning to another city. The best rate for suite room around at the moment. The buffet breakfast also well managed and well managed. We always come back here again."
"369.","Kelly-Marie","25","2023-12-31","5","Lovely Experience. I always enjoy my stay here. I would highly recommend the Novotel Inbalance spa (situated inside the hotel). After a long flight this was the perfect experience. The staff were so friendly and professional. The massage was amazing with great packages to choose from and I left feeling refreshed and relaxed. I would like to extend a special thanks to my masseuse Komang, as she was warm and inviting and even made me come back the next day for the 60min face massage. I really enjoyed the spa because of her and would recommend you book with her on your next visit."

I really appreciated it. She even recommended me to try some local things which I almost missed and was really good. Thank you again!"
"371.","Mina Hanna","150","2024-12-31","4","Great for the late night arrival or late night departures where you want to be close to the airport. Nothing stands out in the hotel just a regular 4 stars airport hotel. Rooms could be cleaner."
"372.","Natasha Nina","45","2019-12-31","5","The room is great, just a lil bit dirty at several corners. Still acceptable. The facilities are super great. If you have flight with Garuda and no baggage, they have direct access to the waiting room. Super comfy. However, limited choice of food and minimarts since you are in the airport area."
"373.","Robbert Pronk","13","2023-12-31","5","Very friendly and helpful staff working at the breakfast buffet. Had some issue with a bad smell from the bathroom, but they immediately offered me a different room. Would recommend, I'd give it a perfect 5/7."

The breakfast was amazing with lots of local and traditional dish’s to taste. Satriai gave us a little tour to describe the different Balinese sauces, juices, and sweets. Table service provided by Tantri was super: friendly, thorough, and caring. She brought me a perfect little latte."
"377.","Morné Breytenbach","32","2018-12-31","5","Had a great experience at this hotel. The friendliest staff I have ever encountered. Rooms are big, modern and the bed is comfortable. The rooms have all the amenities you would need. WiFi is fast enough to watch Youtube, although Skype video calls were a bit choppy at times. Breakfast was not the best, but there is a big variety of dishes available. Being at the airport, there is not much, if anything to do or see within close proximity. There is however a shuttle to a nearby beach. The highlight of my stay was the staff constantly smiling and assisting without hesitation."
"378.","Gede Mantra","1","2022-12-31","5","Brilliant of services, very kind and helpful team, food excellent especially large buffet breakfast and good taste, room..clean, good smell and simple as a center of airport place.

About staff hotel : I even didn't finish my breakfast they collected my cutlery and plate. Now I am sitting here stating at empty table:) All the best whoever will stay here for business or vocation"

Overall, saya suka dg apa yg ada disini.. dari segi pelayanan yg ramah ketika aku mendapatkan trouble pintu kamar mendadak gabisa kebuka😂, restorasi menyajikan makanan yg lezat untuk di santap Sahur & Buka Puasa💯, lingkungan hotel yg nyaman dan gak terlalu crowded, karyawannya yg ramah2 ketika bertemu tamu menerapkan 3S, kamar nyaman, seru pokoknya dg view runaway🤩, sayangnya belum coba ke Runaway Bar yg kayaknya asik deh untuk kesana.. next time kami coba nginep sana lagi yaa🫶🏻 terima kasih Novotel untuk pelayanan dan pengalamannya.. selalu kuabadikan✨✨"

We only spend one night at Novotel, and everybody was really nice. The breakfast was good and Shandra was very very helpful showing us places to go from here."
"386.","Cyndy Owusu","29","2023-12-31","5","Location is prefect. Walking distance from airport. Great for a place to say when you want to be ready to go for the airport. Service is great and the hotel staff are very helpful. Room is bice the only downside is there is only local TV stations. And no Chrome cast/Netflix so make sure you have something you can entertain yourself with. Other than that it's great and we will definitely be back."
"387.","Sarah Pritchard","2","2023-12-31","5","Absolutely wonderful. Less than 5 min walk from the airport, great stay after a long journey. Worth it for the breakfast buffet alone. Room was perfect, service extremely professional and friendly."

"393.","Carla Raynes","43","2022-12-31","5","Got a day use room following getting stuck at the airport. For 6 hours I paid $65AUD which I thought was good value considering the high standard of the room, hotel and facilities. Had a particularly good experience at the Square restaurant, best coffee and meal I had in my whole 2 weeks in bali. Staff were so friendly and accommodating of me and my small baby."
"394.","Floyd Hampton Livingston","63","2018-12-31","5","The rooms here are very nice. Got a king size bed with all the works. WiFi is great too. Food downstairs is on point too. It's good to treat yourself to this hotel before your flight after spending most of your trip in hostels and bungalows. Highly recommend it."
"395.","Ian Kaplan","78","2019-12-31","5","This is the most beautiful airport hotel I have ever stayed at. The common areas of the hotel feature attractive hardwood. The rooms are spacious (for an airport hotel). We have a very comfortable king size bed. We paid for breakfast with our room. The breakfast was very good and featured both western and Indonesian food. The hotel is about a ten minute walk inside the terminal from baggage claim. We didn't have as much time as we would have wished to explore the beautiful grounds of the hotel but we will be back in a few weeks and I look forward to our stay. The attached photo is a flower from the Hotel garden."
"396.","Cristian Baló","74","2023-12-31","5","Very convenient hotel with good amenities in a good location. The staff is super friendly and will make your stay unforgettable Miss ANISA is worth commending. The rooftop bar although opens at 6pm gives you a very nice view of the airport and the nearby beaches. Nice to chill out in the afternoon. The lounge serves hot food and drinks/cocktails, and snacks the whole day, Miss SRI WIYANI will look after all your needs."
"397.","Julia Stoeva","11","2023-12-31","5","Pleasant airport hotel, surprisingly quiet given the proximity to DPS’ runway. Very friendly staff. I enjoyed my In Balance Spa experience with Komang. The 90 min full body massage was excellent. Looking forward to my next visit 🥰"

"399.","Boyoung Hyun","8","2023-12-31","5","I missed my flight so I had to stay one more night in Bali. I found the hotel near the airport. It was very close to the airport and just took 5mins walking from airport. All staff are very nice and especially I want to say thanks to Riska who works at the restaurant. She was very helpful and generous. I recommend you to visit this restaurant for your breakfast."
"400.","Lisa Liljedahl","22","2025-12-01","5","This was our third stay at the Novotel Bali Ngurah Rai. The service and restaurant were excellent. The staff were gracious and very attentive. The front desk staff especially Wendy and Seni were outstanding and incredibly helpful. The head of housekeeping Tarisma helped me with several items and followed up when I suggested that there should be electric outlets on both sides of the bed. Seni Arta checked in with me frequently after we encountered noise from construction outside our room. He made sure that we were moved to another room immediately and followed up afterwords to make sure we were happy with our new room. We come to Bali to catch a charter flight to the Wakatobi Dive resort every year. We normally only stay at the Novotel on our way out of Bali because of the convenience to the airport but after our recent visit we decided to spend to stay 3 nights at the beginning of our trip and not stay at the Anaya on the beach. The reason being that the Anvaya keeps adding costs to trip. Like additional fees for the airport transport. The quality of the staff and restaurant at the Novotel is so good that we will not go to the beach but stay at the Novotel instead."
"401.","Lars F Clausen","223","2023-12-31","5","Stayed here one night, because we had an early flight out of Bali. 3 min walk to check-in / departure gates. Very good hotel if you arrive late or depart early. You can stary here longer, it is only a 15 min walk and you are on Kuta main street. Nice swimming pool and rooftop bar. The hotel is in the airport but there is no noise. I like the shower in the room"

"404.","Antonius Arya","21","2023-12-31","5","From my four days visit to Bali this April, Novotel Airport Bali was the best I have ever experienced during my stays. From the check in process until my departure, my experiences with the hotel and the staffs were very amazing and pleasant. As a privilege for platinum member of Accor All, they upgraded me to their suite room. The suite was nice, although it was a bit small comparing with another suite room of other novotel hotel. this hotel was located conveniently in the airport area so it was very suitable for those traveler who needs quick access to the airport. the gym, the pool, and food quality were good. they had also an executive lounge that serves high tea time and also cocktail evening for members and suite room residents. I would love to stay here again in the future... great job to all staffs in Novotel Ngurah Rai Bali."
"405.","david cho","1","2025-07-31","5","perfect location for transition! very reasonable price with kind staff!!!"
"406.","I Hadiputra","72","2022-12-31","5","Being an airport hotel, I think the best aspect of this hotel is definitely its convenience. For those having a long transit time, I would say this hotel is your best option. The superior room is relatively compact. If you have the opportunity, I would strongly suggest booking their suite. I had the opportunity to try their suite, as we are a family of 3 and we have a lot of luggage during our transit time. The suite is quite spacious. The bathroom is very nice and a great place for relaxing. Price of the suite is around 1.5x superior room, which I think is reasonable. When you book the suite, you got the premier lounge access for afternoon tea. The premier lounge is worth mentioning as you can enjoy plane watching while enjoying some snacks during this afternoon tea time. In addition, they also gave the minibar in the room for free. Thx to Mr Ifan Taufan for welcoming us and helping us with the check in process. The staff are generally very helpful. For parking access, they have premium parking area near the hotel entrance. Make sure to get ticket stamped/signed to avoid the extra fee."
"407.","Meike Budhianto","9","2023-12-31","5","Arrived midnight in Denpasar and the hotel is conveniently 5 minutes walk from the airport, with indoor connections. Room is clean, bed is comfortable. Medium size pool and great to just relax. Service is amazing. We chat with a staff member in the morning, Chandra, who gave us good tips and local Bali attractions. Good selection of local and international cuisine at brekky buffet. Definitely a good transit hotel in Bali."
"408.","Indira Arista","3","2023-12-31","5","That's incredible. The room n facilities have a well condition. For bfast it's really tasty, and also the waitress named Erika give me the best service ever! Hope i can come again to stay at Novotel Airport Bali!"

"413.","Isamar Tello","4","2023-12-31","5","Sri Wigani in the premium lounge was great. We stopped by for afternoon tea and snacks while we waited for our room to be completed. Then stopped after for their happy hour. Sri was great. She gave us a cocktail to choose from during happy hour and provided us with the wifi password. The snacks provided ranged from samosas to fruit. Note that the pool is under construction but they gave us the option to shuttle us to their sister hotel about 30 minutes away. Overall a good stay. Also the walk to the international check in was about 5 minutes which is great."

"415.","Irma Budiarto","89","2023-12-31","2","I stayed in this hotel a few times. I like the service , the people always nice and helpful and convenience from the airport However on my last stay room 527 The room seem Abandoned. The usual couch was not even there The pillows were all so flat like it was a leftover. The pillow cover was even way too big for the pillows. The bed was two beds. Put together as usual but there wasnt any think cover or matttess protector they supposed to put on top of it so there was a dip in the middle I really felt that they just gave me leftover room. Not to mention the walls so think and crying babies next door at 2am. My flight was at 7am I stayed here many times ( came to bali 5’times a year. Recommended this hotel to many friends and family, now I have to reconsidered just incase this happen again . Very dissapointing. Ps I also 99% sure I accidentally left my guasha in the bedroom, they never called me or email me about it"
"416.","Dhanty P","317","2021-12-31","2","Apologize as I'm gonna write this with rather unpleasant review. Went to stay here for a night to accompany my friends who has super early flight the next morning. I drove here with car and kinda surprised to see the parking lot in front of the lobby was not spacious enough and at that time there's some event going on, so I hardly find a spot. After half hour wandering around to secure a parking spot, I'm super confused as to how I reach to hotel lobby. We have to call the hotel representative from the phone booth in the lobby and wait for them to accompany us. The escalator is turned off by the time I arrived there and it's already 7PM and the hallway is too dark. Honestly this is uncomfortable. I don't have much comments for the room, it's perfectly okay with me considering the room rate. One thing surprised me though, for guests to bring their own car and staying the night, the hotel does not provide free parking. I think this is kinda scam. I think they should at least inform us before we make reservation. Upon entering the hotel area, we already had to pay for the airport entrance 30K and now we also had to pay for the parking overnights? .. Just doesn't make sense."
"417.","Siti Meisa Nurlaila","29","2023-12-31","5","The room is big, and it has all the amenities needed (even a hairdryer). The breakfast menu consists of various foods and everything. The minus is the access to the hotel is a bit confusing (because it's located in an actual airport area)."
"418.","Neil Burling","429","2024-12-31","5","This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel, due to transit through Bali airport. On both occasions the staff have been amazing and one this occasion, Juna expertly created cocktails for us and was so nice and welcoming. Juna is an ambassador for Novotel and ensured we were happy, which was amazing. If you are transiting and need a hotel for the night, this is the place and be sure to look out for Juna behind the bar."
"419.","Niki G","37","2018-12-31","5","Excellent hotel. Staff is friendly, helpful and speak a good level of English. Our room had everything we were needed, and it was so quiet despite the fact we were sleeping next to the airport Within the hotel there is a spa and gym, and also a small garden where you can unwind (they have goldfish and everything). It's useful to know that the hotel is accessible from the airport, which is extremely convenient. Just follow the 'airport hotel' sign and you will get there. You however better to approach it from the inside of the airport, rather than from the street, otherwise you need to climb high stairs and get through people trying to sell their taxi services to you. We have had some difficulties with getting to our next destination, however the reception team tried everything to help us, including phoning the local supplier. We really appreciated it. The breakfast has a good selection of local and continental food, the quality of the service is really high. I can absolutely recommend this hotel."
"420.","Jill Taylor","102","2019-12-31","5","Wow! The staff were very attentive and the room was beautifully appointed. Food was superb too. We couldn't be any closer to the check in as we walked from the plane to the hotel. Couldn't hear any outside noise from our room. We will definitely be back."
"421.","Justin Donnelly","617","2017-12-31","4","We had to overnight here due to a delayed flight. Staff were as quick as possible with the influx of passengers. Rooms were to a good standard with great a/c, good water pressure and a pretty decent bed. Their buffet breakfast has a wide variety from local to western options. Great place to stay if you don't want to waste time in Bali traffic and have an early morning connecting flight."
"422.","Paul Hassall","9","2024-12-31","5","Nice room. Lots of breakfast choices. So convenient to be able to walk straight into International Terminal. Didn’t try the pool but it looked good too."
"423.","Steffi D","26","2022-12-31","3","All in all it’s a good Hotel inside the airport. However for the price you pay, I would’ve expected a bit more. Based on the price and the hotel category I would rate it as follows Cleanliness: Looks clean at first sight but rooms and carpet could use some deep cleaning. Breakfast Buffet is huge and had a lot of choices. Quality needs to be improved though. Looks are better than taste. E.g. Pancakes were tough, cake tasteless It is located directly inside the airport and it is very hard to get outside of the Hotel by foot. They should definitely provide a free shuttle to town. Even drop off at the Hotel by Grab is difficult. Wi-Fi is very slow All in all it is way to expensive for what you get."
"424.","Bob Jang","59","2017-12-31","5","I was happy with my stay. Clean. Quiet. Restaurant remained open until 1am. Great service. Lovely staff. Highly recommend for anyone in transit. It’s a good price. The massage at the hotel spa was pretty average for the equivalent of $50AUD. Staff member was more than happy to take cash... A 5minute walk outside would get you similar massages for $7-10."
"425.","Red Mac","134","2022-12-31","4","Very convenient with the airport, food is probably the only half decent meal I’ve had in Bali but that’s not hard to beat. Rooms are nice, staff helpful, got a free food platter & beer for being a gold member of Accor hotels. Roof top bar that can see the planes landing / taking off."

"427.","Manuel ROBERT","44","2018-12-31","5","Arrived at midnight, we were exhausted by the long trip from Europe and the Novotel was very tempting to immediately access a bed and shower. Our expectations were met beyond hopes. The hotel is as close it could be, 5 minutes walk . It was a relief and and VERY good way to avoid the hassle of the taxi struggle to reach the hotel. A warm welcome, smiles and a wonderful room was awaiting us. The junior suite was perfect, all you can think of, great expresso machine, waterfall rain drop shower or classic showers, lovely garden view, calm and silent, nice interior design. Gym, premier lounge, nice pool, and a buffet breakfast full of wonders. Definitely a great way to start our stay in Bali. Very Good for family, couples, friend groups and solo travelers. Very good value for quality and money."

Excellent service, nice rooms, wonderful food, delightful atmosphere in a spacious and well-designed setting. This is an in-airport hotel where you can actually forget that you are at the airport. It's a little oasis."
"436.","Fabius Wiesmann","19","2022-12-31","5","Whether you're coming in late, and want to rest before starting your trip around the island, or having an early morning flight, this is the place to stay. During our last trip, we stayed here twice for the mentioned szenarios. This place has everything you need and more! The staff is very welcoming, highly trained, and efficient, making any interaction pleasant, smooth and swift. The rooms are very clean, well equipped, and spacious. As a diamond member, I was happy to be upgraded and enjoy the benefits their suite had to offer. The room was incredible in size, and the welcoming offerings were too kind. The breakfast is extensive and of good quality, something we really enjoyed before stepping on a long flight. Having access to both domestic and international terminals makes for a long nights sleep and short entry before your departure. The lounge is spacious, and provides a surprisingly extensive palette of food, snacks and drinks (the pina colada was great btw!). Although I could not make use of it, the pool was incredibly large given that few people will probably use it, and should make for a relaxing time. To conclude, I highly recommend this place to just about anyone!"

"442.","Jason Wymer","191","2019-12-31","4","Booking up was easy and straight forward with a pre payment being taken 3 months before we got there. I generally like the pre payments as my planning very rarely sees us having to forfeit a booking. Near arrival time we messaged the hotel about the shuttle bus, this is not needed as the hotel is literally 150m outside of arrivals, well sign posted to. The hotel was very helpful even arranging us someone to wait at arrivals to escourt us to the hotel, we declined this generous offer though. Checkin was swift, helpful and informative. During checkin we were told the hotel had been overbooked so we had been upgraded to the executive room, this didn't seem much different to the superior king room we booked? This room overlooked the pool area. Room was clean, had a ipod dock, TV, coffee machine, fridge and toiletries for you to use. The bed was very comfortable, firm but comfortable. There are plenty of things to do at this hotel, my girlfriend made use of the gym early morning which has running machine, bicycle and free weights. Breakfast charge was 140,000IDR and had a good variety of foods and drinks including breads, pastries, rice dishes, Indonesian dishes, sushi, fresh fruits, yoghurts, egg station and cereals so you should find something you like. After we were told the hotel was overbooked we explained that we would be checking out at 10:30 which is earlier than the 12:00 check out time. In the morning we had been kicked off the internet system so had to call reception and get us reinstalled. Then at 08:00 and again at 08:45 we had room service come and ask to clean the room, these occurrences felt like we were being politely asked to leave early, to which we didn't and left at 10:30 as explained the day before. If the hotel has been over booked then kicking a customer off the WiFi system and having room service try to rush a customer out of their rooms will only give a customer ammunition to give a low score, Luckily we are not rushed and will go when we want before a checkout time as we are paying guests and expect the service offered. A nice place to stay with a great location for transit flight waits but dont let them rush you when they make problems for themselves by overbooking rooms!!"
"443.","Caio Moreira","106","2022-12-31","3","Don't expect too much. Very regular rooms, regular breakfast, regular clean spaces, service was maybe the downside staying a little below the regular. Have to mention that restaurant was open until late, they accept contactless payment and it is literally located inside the airport, there is one door from the international check-in area to the hotel lobby."

"448.","Linda W","43","2024-12-31","3","We arrived a late flight today - 7th Feb 2024 - in Bali and when we did check in, it was past-midnight. We were tired and when entered the room, everything was like we had expected from Novotel Airport as this is not the first time we stayed here. We were glad as what we need is to rest and a good sleep before we start our day in Bali. But to our shock the toilet had a very strong urine smell like a public toilet and shower room drainage was clogged. It was not something we expected for the Novotel's standard of cleanliness. But we are now just too tired to call FO and ask the engineering to do something for the clogging and HK to clean the toilet. I truly hope this will be the 1st and last incident happen for guests, cause Novotel Bali Airport always have a good reputation..yet this time not for us."

"451.","Kieley Therese Dunlop","4","2019-12-31","5","An amazing oasis in the hub of the airport. My husband and I landed at 11pm and within half an from exiting the plane were in the comfort of our room. No stress after 20 odd hours of travelling- gold!!! The buffet breakfast was plentiful and definitely value for money. The pool area is beautiful and relaxing."
"452.","Dan B","232","2022-12-31","4","Not bad. The worst part was trying to find how to walk to the hotel. As you are exiting the airport, turn left before walking past the large, ornate gate-like entrances. If you look to your left, you will see a sign that says Airport Hotel. Follow that through a parking garage and up a ramp. Another minor bad thing is the showers. There is no door, so you need to be careful that you don't get water splashing out of the bathroom area onto the carpet. It's doable, just an annoying design to me :). Beds are firm, but with padding on top. Also, the rooms are sound proof - you won't hear the planes, traffic, or hotel neighbors! Buffet breakfast is ok, plenty of options. Choose this airport as we were arriving at midnight and wanted a close and quiet hotel to quickly grab some Zzz and food before heading to our next destination."
"453.","Jane","1","2024-12-31","5","We recently stayed on two occasions. Both times staff were very helpful and friendly. The hotel's proximity to the airports is great."
"454.","Damien Michel","22","2018-12-31","4","Its an OK hotel for transit or cancelled flight passengers. Nicely decor with warm and friendly staffs. Being Bali, there are better hotels for a Bali holiday. Service available are adequate and slightly pricey than outside but that is normal for all hotels. Room were clean and quiet on the ground floor although don’t know about the upper floor since this hotel is a stone throw from the airport."
"455.","Michael Gilligan","37","2023-12-31","5","Fantastic hotel, and refreshingly good service, when asking what options were vegan at breakfast, the manager offered to have 2 vegan dishes made up which were wonderful. Tantri looked after us at our table. Great hospitality!"

"457.","Amy Williams","9","2018-12-31","5","Stayed for one night due to late arrival into Bali. Awesome hotel, very nice and clean, great amenities. On our departure we wanted to book a day room as our flight is leaving late, they were fully booked. We were still treated like guests, offered to store our luggage, use of spa facilities and wifi. Great customer experience and lovely helpful staff"
"458.","Lushon Nohsul","786","2025-07-31","5","nice to walk right from hotel into airport"
"459.","loretta fong","46","2024-12-31","5","If you're arriving/leaving late to/from Bali or need a hotel close to the airport, then this is a great choice. We had the good fortune to stay there when the traffic stopped outside the airport and people jumped out of cars to walk to the airport on 29/12/23. You can get a late 6pm checkout which really helps for those late flights out of Bali. The included buffet breakfast is very good with lots of options. The oxtail nasi goreng we had for dinner was the best nasi goreng we had while we were in Indonesia. It's not a luxury hotel but well positioned for what it is and is walking distance from both international and domestic airports... Less than 5 minutes. And best of all we did not hear one plane in either of our stays there. And like most hotels in Indonesia, the staff and their service was excellent."
"460.","Joel Balan","43","2018-12-31","5","Best thing about this hotel that there is a shortcut straight into the check-in area. No need to wait in long security lines! Good for overnight layovers and I believe you can book a 6 hour stay in a room. Perfect if you're looking for a shower and a nap. Staff and service are amazing."
"461.","Sherly DeVrou","7","2018-12-31","4","Inside airport, but I really wish there are more signs on how to get there. It was okay for staying short term, but if you looking for longer stay, different location closer to your destination is better. The room is nicely furnished but little short for amenities. They are available but only upon request. In room dining is good, the prices are rather steep for simple menu. However, the taste is good."
"462.","M “Meolive” Oliver","41","2017-12-31","1","THE BAD: 1) This place smells like sewer, as the night progressed it got even worse. Very much unbearable. We spent one night & that was too much. The hotel is not even okay to serve as an overnight before the flight mainly because that smell is awful & sickening. 2) They do not inform u of shuttle service so we ordered a taxi to then find some people scheduling a hotel shuttle. 3) They only gave us 2 bottles of water. 4) Carpeted down the halls which makes it difficult to pull luggage. THE GOOD: the room is a cute futuristic modern style. Compact but functional."
"463.","Dimpled Purin","6","2023-12-31","5","A five star hotel indeed. Services are top-tier. Luxury atmosphere, nice and clean room. A lot of facilities available as well. Dont have any doubt to revisit again next time! Thank you 🏔️"

The toilet bidet dirty and moldy . You need to bleach and clean the bidet water spray. Also the sink has a mold too You need to clean those bathroom real good for International standard Hotel. The hotel is convenient to go to airport check in. The best guy is the Bell Boy! There are really helping with our luggage’s. I won’t come back to this hotel , the reason is about the dirty toilet in the room. I will try Hilton Garden next time."
"469.","Steve Middleton","289","2022-12-31","4","Very convenient 5 minute walk from airport arrivals exit. Staff will meet you and walk you back to the hotel if you ask. Very quiet considering it's right next to the airport. Didn't hear a single plane the 18 hours we were there."
"470.","Jason Xu","62","2022-12-31","5","This is the PERFECT hotel to spend a couple hours before your flight to shower and rest up. Booked the cheapest room with 2 single beds for a family of four adults and spent a couple hours here for that exact reason as our Qantas flight was at 10PM. Room and bathroom were clean and modern. Staff were polite and professional, rooms were clean, and the hotel is directly connected to the airport, so 5 minutes' walk from reception and you're at the airlines' check-in areas. They also provide 2 free bottles of water (Aqua brand, in glass bottles) in the room, but the Wi-Fi allows connections for up to 2 devices only."

"478.","Mariusz Scislowski","137","2022-12-31","5","Location is an absolute winner. This is a walking distance to both domestic and international terminals and therefore it is an absolute winner for an overnight stay if you are transiting between flights. It is a little bit more expensive then other hotels nearby but you wont need to worry about transport and costs associated with it. Additionally, it is clean, with lots of rooms and breakfast was good. I have nothing bad to say. This is what an airport hotel should be."
"479.","Mariah Ware","18","2022-12-31","1","Really disappointed won’t stay again. I had to change the booking due to flight time arrival so I emailed them and got a prompt response reassuring me that it would be adjusted. This was a few weeks prior to arrival. On the night of arrival at 1am massive wait time to check in. Waited close to 1 hour. Then when I was seen I was told the booking was not adjusted. I showed them the email from their hotel response and receptionist did not help but just said apologised and said nothing they could do and they were booked out. I had share a single bed with a family member because I had no other option. We had a number of suitcases, no one helped us to carry them to the room. Wouldn’t bother again due to this experience."
"480.","Clixshper","4","2017-12-31","4","Was a nice airport hotel to stay the night after a long day flying. Breakfast was awesome and really had a variety of food which was great.

The pricing is good as well , the hotel has direct access to international terminal, checkin and checkout was fast. The sound insulation for rooms is bad.

"490.","Wong Francis","1061","2019-12-31","4","The hotel is impressive in design, service, and its outstanding sound proofing of the room, considered it is facing the runway. Only a very minimal amount of engine hum came through, but not enough to disturb one's sleep. I find the front staffs welcoming and warm. The price of this hotel is way cheaper than the novotel at Bangkok airport (expensive and outdated). There's a fair amount of walking if you are loaded with luggage. I took the offer of a driver (upstairs departure level) for 50,000 IDR, a small price to pay on such a hot humid day, turned out he had a lovely 7 seater! Overall, I'm very satisfied with this hotel right next to the airport. A good choice to consider if you are on transit and has a very early flight to catch the next day."
"491.","Pat A","171","2019-12-31","5","A conveniently located (a short stroll) from Denpasar (Bali) Airport. Staff were very welcoming and friendly. Check in and check out was smooth.

I felt so relaxed and strolled to my flight which was nearby. Will definitely be coming back soon :)"

Quiet, clean, aesthetically beautiful, the food is great....and the hotel staff....hands down very welcoming and exceptionally accommodating (side note: we had a horrible experience with arrangements with another 'host' place to stay). The warmest and kindest people I've ever met. Novotel Airport was definitely home for us and I'm quote sure we were adopted as Family. 🙏 Matur Suksma to the wonderful staff at Novotel/Accor Hotels!

"504.","Steven Heath","864","2019-12-31","4","A very pleasant and quiet hotel to stay in right next to the airport. It has a direct walk link into the airport itself - very handy. I don't really understand why I cannot collect Accor points for food and services purchased at the hotel. Even though I booked through a third party site (and wouldn't earn credit for the room), surely everything else I spend should get points, or do I take my loyalty out the front door to eat and have spa treatments?"

It is not worth the money to be close to the airport, much better places like the backpackers. The food was buffet style so it was cold and with little flavor. This hotel likes to steal your money. booked a room and then extended because of a late flight. Then Jetstar couldn’t get the flight loaded before the airport closed for the night so flight was canceled. They put into this hotel should have let them put us in IBIS. This hotel will not refund the half day I paid when jetstar paid them for a night. The way I see it they got paid 150% for the room and they are ok with it"

The breakfast buffet is amazing - a huge spread of western and Asian choices. I'll stay here again if I'm flying in or out of Bali late at night."

"515.","Alan Karyono","669","2022-12-31","3","Room is good. Small, but all are okay. Soundproof also. Staffs are understaffed, seems like they have not added back staff post covid pandemic. Access from domestic terminal will be tough when you carry luggages, as there are no hotel staff helping you. And the lobby is upstairs, with only escalators to go up. (So image you carry big luggage upstairs using escalator, with no aircon.)"
"516.","Franz Bagares","36","2019-12-31","5","Wish I could have stayed more! Arrived late at night so I booked an overnight room at Novotel. The staff were great and super friendly. The room was even better. I was at the executive king room which had every basic things you need and some extra stuff like a sewing kit, shoe shine kit and even a vanity kit! The breakfast buffet was great, with lots of options to choose from. The only negative thing for me about this hotel is how there's very few signages and the walk way wasnt well lit. Overall great experience."
"517.","Fior Daniella","41","2024-12-31","5","I think fresh has good food for breakfast selection. If you like to splurge on every pennies worth always stop by a nearby mall to grab some snacks in buckets....which i regret not doing but il do that next time."
"518.","Chris Barker","20","2023-12-31","4","If you want a hotel close to the airport in Bali then this is the place. Right on the airstrip between the international and domestic airports. Perfect for our 1 night stopover from Australia before flying to lombok for the moto gp. The entrance is pretty hard to find and is not that well sign posted. I think the best way is take the elevator from arrivals on ground floor to departures and there is a bridge across to the novotel. Being so close to the runway we expected a bit of noise but it was surprisingly quiet. Bars and food were decent for fair prices. Rooms were fine prob 4 star, a bit dated for 5 star."

And service at bar and restaurant was so slow, had to get my own drinks from the bar as they took20mins+ to make and then just sat there getting warm, pretty much got ignored, went back to bar 3 hrs later to get a soft drink, 3 people behind bar, no one was interested in helping so we left, very disappointed with our experience"

"539.","YC","45","2018-12-31","5","Really a good idea to stay one night here before flying home especially when we took a long day to return from the Gili islands. Right next to the airport departure hall makes life easy and comfortable before long flight. Rooftop bar allows you to spend time having a drink while watching the planes take off and landed. Reasonable price for the quality of the rooms and hotel. Enjoy it."
"540.","Towny","45","2022-12-31","2","rather difficult to find if u came from international arrivals, lack of signage to find this hotel, i had to push my trolley on the road just to get to main entrance which is unsealed pavements, not recommended to push your trolley on it or if u came in on a wheelchair. no help at all from their staff. also no lift to get to the mezzanine that leads to the lobby (thru a lift, what teh heck). so i had to use the ramp to get there, with of course, no help from their staff. food was okay i suppose if u just stick to the western breakfast. but the indonesian cuisine there were seriously bland, i guess its to cater more for foreigners. other than its a good place to rejuvenate before your next flight. its appropriately priced (except for the food, better go to nearby solaria to get tastier and good priced meal)"
"541.","Anita Kitchen","3","2023-12-31","5","Terimakasih, gluten free bread nya enak, Breakfastnya enak, makanan dan dessertnya bermacam macam, pelayanan staff nya juga ramah, resto yang luas, kamar yang nyaman. Pokoknya rekomendasi kalau mampir ke airport wajib menginap disini"

Aldo at the front desk was very kind and helpful in our sleep-deprived state. we were also able to store bags down at the desk instead of hauling them to our room and back just a few hours later. the cost is a little more than one can find for another airport but for convenience it cannot be beaten. It is just a bit of a walk from international terminal if you have a lot of baggage."

Dinner & lunch were bainmarie service of ok food in a city where you can get the best meal you've ever had for $10. For a hotel that is advertised at $150 aud a night, I think they need to severely up their game. Staff are all friendly and helpful, but I believe management are just in it for the fat gains had by cheap labour workforce and easy access to customers from the airport."

They do a day rate of idr 700k but you can't prebook it, so sometimes prebooking the whole night is cheaper! Clean and nicely presented."
"556.","Dirk Wolter","93","2020-12-31","4","Good for a stay over if you need to be near the airport. Great service, rooms are rather average. Request the top floor if you want some day light. If you don't require airport proximity, then you'd better stay in Nusa Dua."

"558.","Chelsea","16","2021-12-31","1","I booked here for a stress free morning before my flight out of Bali, and had the worst experience I have ever had in a hotel! Initially I was excited as the rooms were lovely and the location very convenient but the morning of my flight was a disaster! I woke up and started my shower at 7am, to find the water was extremely dirty & brown. See attached picture. I had to check in for my flight at 8am so thought 1 hour was plenty of time to get ready and have breakfast. I called reception and they said they would send someone. I had to call twice and about 15 minutes later someone arrived and told me that I just had to let the water run and it would go clean. I did this for 10 minutes, the water got cleaner but never clear!! still murky! I had given up on having clean water at this stage! I just needed to shower asap! But my next issue was that I had no hot water. I called reception who acted like I didn't know how to use a shower, kept telling me to move the tap. I had to keep calling and complaining till finally at 7:45am 2 plumbers turned up. All the while I had been asking for another room to shower in before my flight, and being denied. They played around with the shower. (they couldn't get the hot water to work) till at 7:55am I asked them to leave as I needed to get ready or I would be late to check in for my flight. I had a freezing shower in still dirty brown water, I have footage of the dirty water I had to shower in. When I got out of the shower at 7:59am I was finally offered another room to shower in. I had been asking for this for the last 40 minutes! And now it was too late! I was stressed as I was late for check in by this stage, I was freezing cold and did not feel clean at all. This was a horrible way to start a day with 14 hours of travel! Management offered me breakfast to compensate, I am celiac and they said that they could do that. Then on my way out they told me they couldn't do that either. I asked for a refund but all that was told I could have a complimentary night in the next 12 months, but a refund wasn't possible. I received one phone call after all this, and was told that the hotel would be in touch in regards to the incident. I heard nothing again and my email after to the hotel was ignored. This was a worse experience than I would expect from a backpackers let alone a 4 star hotel! To make matter worse I have come back to Bali and called about the complimentary night, I was give another email to contact in regards to confirming and booking, I have emailed twice and no response and the front desk said they couldn't help me & all I could do is email but no one has responded. It is a shame as I was excited to stay and the rooms are lovely, its got great access to the terminal but the whole way this was handled was terrible for a 4 star hotel, which while is inexpensive is very pricy for Bali standards! Go elsewhere, Hilton airport hotel is great! ** later edit, the hotel has commented that I received a refund, this is a lie."
"559.","Daniel","170","2018-12-31","5","Fantastic hotel for an overnight stay in between transit places, with a very nice restaurant. At the end of our holiday, we had some time to kill so came back here for a nice meal while waiting for a delayed flight. It's about a 5 minute walk or so after exiting the international arrivals, via an undercover walkway, and a similar distance from the domestic airport. There are also ATMs very conveniently located near the hotel and of course the hotel and restaurant safely accept credit cards. We didn't get to use the pool due to the weather but it looked really nice and there was a spa and fitness centre too. Room was secure, had international power sockets, was well spaced out and was nicely styled."
"560.","Amir Shamsuddin","13","2023-12-31","5","Fantastic hotel with excellent facilities. Staff were all very helpful. Special mention to the Premier Lounge staff, Sri Wiyani, for making my stay here each time a memorable one. Very pleasant and happy experience here. 👍🏽"
"561.","Tommy Holt","47","2019-12-31","5","Absolutely perfect for our needs. We had a half day here because of our later flight.

The rooms are large and beautifully appointed with numerous nice touches, such as complimentary toothbrush, soap and shampoo. The bathroom is great with a rain shower feature.

"577.","M","42","2018-12-31","1","Revised review after another stay: Firstly, I find it very hard to understand how the reviews for this hotel can look so good (with a 4.4 star average rating???) based on my own and others experiences. Room was dirty. Carpets full of other peoples’ droppings. Sticky places on surfaces. Definitely not cleaned properly. Found a pair of used hotel slippers from a previous guest next to the bed. Very noisy cleaning staff - slamming doors, knocking on surfaces while cleaning, talking loud - this occurs throughout the day. Complaining to the management about the noisy cleaners on a previous stay has obviously had no effect. Internet very slow. Really, really bad food. Probably the worst I have ever experienced in any hotel. Do yourself a favour and go and eat at the Burger King or food court near the domestic terminal, rather than at the hotel itself. Or bring your own food! The only redeeming feature of this hotel is that the bed is reasonably comfortable and the air con works ok. That’s why it got one whole star from me."

"589.","Chrissie MacLean","108","2025-01-21","1","The grossest hotel I have ever stayed in. Honestly, the room smelt of stale cigarettes, the carpet was torn and stained, the sheets were cheap synthetic material, the bed left me with a sore back and the bathroom was grotty. Breakfast was okay, decent variety but nothing special. The best thing is the location when you have a super late or early flight but do yourself a favour and take a 2 minute taxi ride down the road to the Hilton Garden Inn which is a million times better in every way and somehow cheaper. I’m absolutely baffled as to how this disgusting hotel had such a high rating."

"591.","Rama Kolkman","14","2025-01-21","1","Quite disappointed that even though had a cancellation of no refund but sometimes a medical emergency that cant be controlled. They wont even consider a 50% refund. So just be aware of this issue for those who decides to do any booking in the future. Would like to add and as you can see nothing to rectify the issue further. All I get is an apology. I will definitely not stay here in the future if this is the kind of damage control they give. The best would be provide a contact email or whatsapp. So that I can contact you guys to explain the situation. But nothing very poor quality of service."

The disgusting stains in the carpet are so common that it seems like a joke, every square foot has MULTIPLE stains in it - I’m talking dozens of stains. Additionally the carpet seems to have not been vacuumed in over a week, little bits of debris everywhere. When I got into the shower I freaked out thinking there was a spider on my towel only to see it was a wad of hair hanging off the neatly folded towel on the rack. What other things have I not noticed if this is so glaringly obvious? The towels are so dingy they look like they’re supposed to be beige colour. Why does this hotel not offer wash cloths? For a king size room you get 2 small bath towels and 1 hand towel. That’s it. The wifi was so spotty, I couldn’t go more than a few minutes before I had to manually reconnect. Not acceptable in 2023. ***Read through some of the reviews, there’s multiple that are word for word the same. Copy & paste. Not sure what kind of positive review games are going on but it’s definitely sus. Would not recommend."
"594.","Cindy","73","2025-01-21","1","booked around 11 rooms for 8 and 9 april 2024 through the hotel's reservation team via email. the service from the reservation team was horrible, I didn't get any reply so I had to keep calling them through phone, almost like BEGGING to reply my email. I had to beg them to send me their bank account because I want to do the payment but they ignored me for days. I decided to contact them via whatsapp but they remain ignorant and slow. I have expressed my dissapointment directly through email and whatsapp yet they didn't seem to care I have sent the rooming list which includes the flight detail of each person because they are arriving at different times, yet they keep asking me to send the rooming list and flight details several times. the tone of their voice (the reservation team) didn't sound quite nice either on the phone. judging from their attitude, it seems to me that they don't need any clients so I will never go back to this hotel again."
"595.","M “Meolive” Oliver","42","2018-01-21","1","THE BAD: 1) This place smells like sewer, as the night progressed it got even worse. Very much unbearable. We spent one night & that was too much. The hotel is not even okay to serve as an overnight before the flight mainly because that smell is awful & sickening. 2) They do not inform u of shuttle service so we ordered a taxi to then find some people scheduling a hotel shuttle. 3) They only gave us 2 bottles of water. 4) Carpeted down the halls which makes it difficult to pull luggage. THE GOOD: the room is a cute futuristic modern style. Compact but functional."
"596.","Mariah Ware","18","2023-01-21","1","Really disappointed won’t stay again. I had to change the booking due to flight time arrival so I emailed them and got a prompt response reassuring me that it would be adjusted. This was a few weeks prior to arrival. On the night of arrival at 1am massive wait time to check in. Waited close to 1 hour. Then when I was seen I was told the booking was not adjusted. I showed them the email from their hotel response and receptionist did not help but just said apologised and said nothing they could do and they were booked out. I had share a single bed with a family member because I had no other option. We had a number of suitcases, no one helped us to carry them to the room. Wouldn’t bother again due to this experience."
"597.","Brian Hawn","154","2019-01-21","1","The room is clean and staff is friendly. They have warm to hot rooms with low water pressure and not very comfortable. It is not worth the money to be close to the airport, much better places like the backpackers. The food was buffet style so it was cold and with little flavor. This hotel likes to steal your money. booked a room and then extended because of a late flight. Then Jetstar couldn’t get the flight loaded before the airport closed for the night so flight was canceled. They put into this hotel should have let them put us in IBIS. This hotel will not refund the half day I paid when jetstar paid them for a night. The way I see it they got paid 150% for the room and they are ok with it"
"598.","alec saris","22","2024-01-21","1","Booked a short stay before pm flight, toilet roll was saturated??? And service at bar and restaurant was so slow, had to get my own drinks from the bar as they took20mins+ to make and then just sat there getting warm, pretty much got ignored, went back to bar 3 hrs later to get a soft drink, 3 people behind bar, no one was interested in helping so we left, very disappointed with our experience"
"599.","Brett Randall","7","2018-01-21","1","Had to move rooms twice because the first two had a smell of wet/mould. Dinner & lunch were bainmarie service of ok food in a city where you can get the best meal you've ever had for $10. For a hotel that is advertised at $150 aud a night, I think they need to severely up their game. Staff are all friendly and helpful, but I believe management are just in it for the fat gains had by cheap labour workforce and easy access to customers from the airport."

"601.","Chelsea","16","2022-01-21","1","I booked here for a stress free morning before my flight out of Bali, and had the worst experience I have ever had in a hotel! Initially I was excited as the rooms were lovely and the location very convenient but the morning of my flight was a disaster! I woke up and started my shower at 7am, to find the water was extremely dirty & brown. See attached picture. I had to check in for my flight at 8am so thought 1 hour was plenty of time to get ready and have breakfast. I called reception and they said they would send someone. I had to call twice and about 15 minutes later someone arrived and told me that I just had to let the water run and it would go clean. I did this for 10 minutes, the water got cleaner but never clear!! still murky! I had given up on having clean water at this stage! I just needed to shower asap! But my next issue was that I had no hot water. I called reception who acted like I didn't know how to use a shower, kept telling me to move the tap. I had to keep calling and complaining till finally at 7:45am 2 plumbers turned up. All the while I had been asking for another room to shower in before my flight, and being denied. They played around with the shower. (they couldn't get the hot water to work) till at 7:55am I asked them to leave as I needed to get ready or I would be late to check in for my flight. I had a freezing shower in still dirty brown water, I have footage of the dirty water I had to shower in. When I got out of the shower at 7:59am I was finally offered another room to shower in. I had been asking for this for the last 40 minutes! And now it was too late! I was stressed as I was late for check in by this stage, I was freezing cold and did not feel clean at all. This was a horrible way to start a day with 14 hours of travel! Management offered me breakfast to compensate, I am celiac and they said that they could do that. Then on my way out they told me they couldn't do that either. I asked for a refund but all that was told I could have a complimentary night in the next 12 months, but a refund wasn't possible. I received one phone call after all this, and was told that the hotel would be in touch in regards to the incident. I heard nothing again and my email after to the hotel was ignored. This was a worse experience than I would expect from a backpackers let alone a 4 star hotel! To make matter worse I have come back to Bali and called about the complimentary night, I was give another email to contact in regards to confirming and booking, I have emailed twice and no response and the front desk said they couldn't help me & all I could do is email but no one has responded. It is a shame as I was excited to stay and the rooms are lovely, its got great access to the terminal but the whole way this was handled was terrible for a 4 star hotel, which while is inexpensive is very pricy for Bali standards! Go elsewhere, Hilton airport hotel is great! ** later edit, the hotel has commented that I received a refund, this is a lie."
"602.","A G","35","2023-01-21","1","This hotel is disgusting. Absolutely filthy. The rooms are so gross, the carpets have food stuck on them, there is liquid splattered on the walls, and it stinks. It’s a super old hotel - the Novotel needs to invest in it and make it more modern. Terrible experience overall."
"603.","M","42","2019-01-21","1","Revised review after another stay: Firstly, I find it very hard to understand how the reviews for this hotel can look so good (with a 4.4 star average rating???) based on my own and others experiences. Room was dirty. Carpets full of other peoples’ droppings. Sticky places on surfaces. Definitely not cleaned properly. Found a pair of used hotel slippers from a previous guest next to the bed. Very noisy cleaning staff - slamming doors, knocking on surfaces while cleaning, talking loud - this occurs throughout the day. Complaining to the management about the noisy cleaners on a previous stay has obviously had no effect. Internet very slow. Really, really bad food. Probably the worst I have ever experienced in any hotel. Do yourself a favour and go and eat at the Burger King or food court near the domestic terminal, rather than at the hotel itself. Or bring your own food! The only redeeming feature of this hotel is that the bed is reasonably comfortable and the air con works ok. That’s why it got one whole star from me."

Saya bahkan mengatur agar keluarga dan teman-teman saya menginap di Novotel untuk pernikahan saya di Bali, tetapi bukan di hotel bandara. Pengalaman saya sebelumnya di Novotel selalu positif. Namun, yang satu ini adalah satu-satunya pengecualian. Pertama, ketika saya tiba di lobi hotel, tidak ada seorang pun yang menyambut saya. Seseorang sedang menggulir ponsel mereka, dan staf lainnya sedang berbicara di konter. Mereka melihat tamu membawa tas, tetapi mereka tetap melakukan urusan mereka sendiri. Mereka baru menyadari saya berdiri di sana cukup lama sebelum berteriak kepada saya untuk datang ke konter! Setelah check-in, tidak ada penjelasan tentang pendekatan hotel. Mereka hanya mengarahkan kami ke kamar. Baru setelah saya meminta bantuan untuk membawakan barang bawaan saya, mereka mengatakan akan mengirimkannya kepada kami. Mungkin mereka kekurangan staf atau sibuk, tetapi saya rasa tingkat layanan yang diberikan oleh staf ini tidak memadai untuk tugas resepsionis. Hal yang sama berlaku untuk check-out! Fasilitas hotel bahkan tidak ramah terhadap penumpang yang membawa barang bawaan. Stafnya tampak sama sekali tidak membantu dan bahkan tidak menyapa pelanggan. Saya penasaran, apakah ini pendekatan baru di Novotel, atau kami memang diabaikan begitu saja."

Being advised 3 days before check-in that we'll have to share a bed with our young child as rollaway beds are only for Suites (which are now sold out), is not OK. My partner will now have to sleep on the floor, which after a long day of travelling and paying AUD$168 for the night, will put a dampener on the start of our holiday. If bed sharing is the only solution for this situation, you need to update your system instead of inconveniencing your guests."

Empty bottles left behind it just wasn't nice at all. $15 just for the cab to drop you there. Only worth it for the super early morning flights out."
"706.","shaun koh","18","2025-01-21","2","It’s a four star hotel in intent, but 2 star in execution. I just checked in. My hotel room is filthy: there’s what appears to be blood stains / bodily fluids on the headboard, bed frame, and carpet. If someone was killed in here, you owe it to your customers to deep clean it. At least the bed linens are clean. I thought this would be the well maintained airport hotel their google reviews suggest they are. Considering their price premium, maybe I got a lemon, but it is already systemic process failure that customers would need to vet the basic cleanliness and hygiene of their rooms for them. I’m glad I’m leaving in a few hours."
"707.","Sivamathuran Sivaraman","5","2024-01-21","2","My wife and I were a bit disappointed in this hotel. Despite reading all the positive reviews before we booked, we found the hotel to be run down and not up to standard in terms of cleanliness. As we were staying for one night, we didn't bother to provide any comments to the staff. The main negatives- we noticed the towels, sheets, pillow cases and carpet had stains. The pillow itself was also stained a dark yellow colour! The positives- the staff were very friendly and the breakfast was decent. Compared to other Novotel Hotels (such as the one next to Athens airport) this hotel was run down and not the same quality."
"708.","Irma Budiarto","89","2024-01-21","2","I stayed in this hotel a few times. I like the service , the people always nice and helpful and convenience from the airport However on my last stay room 527 The room seem Abandoned. The usual couch was not even there The pillows were all so flat like it was a leftover. The pillow cover was even way too big for the pillows. The bed was two beds. Put together as usual but there wasnt any think cover or matttess protector they supposed to put on top of it so there was a dip in the middle I really felt that they just gave me leftover room. Not to mention the walls so think and crying babies next door at 2am. My flight was at 7am I stayed here many times ( came to bali 5’times a year. Recommended this hotel to many friends and family, now I have to reconsidered just incase this happen again . Very dissapointing. Ps I also 99% sure I accidentally left my guasha in the bedroom, they never called me or email me about it"
"709.","Dhanty P","317","2022-01-21","2","Apologize as I'm gonna write this with rather unpleasant review. Went to stay here for a night to accompany my friends who has super early flight the next morning. I drove here with car and kinda surprised to see the parking lot in front of the lobby was not spacious enough and at that time there's some event going on, so I hardly find a spot. After half hour wandering around to secure a parking spot, I'm super confused as to how I reach to hotel lobby. We have to call the hotel representative from the phone booth in the lobby and wait for them to accompany us. The escalator is turned off by the time I arrived there and it's already 7PM and the hallway is too dark. Honestly this is uncomfortable. I don't have much comments for the room, it's perfectly okay with me considering the room rate. One thing surprised me though, for guests to bring their own car and staying the night, the hotel does not provide free parking. I think this is kinda scam. I think they should at least inform us before we make reservation. Upon entering the hotel area, we already had to pay for the airport entrance 30K and now we also had to pay for the parking overnights? .. Just doesn't make sense."
"710.","Mina Weiler","8","2021-01-21","2","The Hotel is good, the receptionist wasn’t that friendly. The breakfast is good. The room it’s ok The only things bothered me is the bathroom. The toilet bidet dirty and moldy . You need to bleach and clean the bidet water spray. Also the sink has a mold too You need to clean those bathroom real good for International standard Hotel. The hotel is convenient to go to airport check in. The best guy is the Bell Boy! There are really helping with our luggage’s. I won’t come back to this hotel , the reason is about the dirty toilet in the room. I will try Hilton Garden next time."
"711.","Towny","45","2023-01-21","2","rather difficult to find if u came from international arrivals, lack of signage to find this hotel, i had to push my trolley on the road just to get to main entrance which is unsealed pavements, not recommended to push your trolley on it or if u came in on a wheelchair. no help at all from their staff. also no lift to get to the mezzanine that leads to the lobby (thru a lift, what teh heck). so i had to use the ramp to get there, with of course, no help from their staff. food was okay i suppose if u just stick to the western breakfast. but the indonesian cuisine there were seriously bland, i guess its to cater more for foreigners. other than its a good place to rejuvenate before your next flight. its appropriately priced (except for the food, better go to nearby solaria to get tastier and good priced meal)"
"712.","Ashley F","7","2024-01-21","2","DO NOT EAT THE BREAKFAST! had terrible bali belly after drinking the guava juice, flies all over the food, watched people sneeze right into food, breakfast is not sanitary.

"713.","Grace","4","2018-01-21","2","Convenient location for our early flight but carpet was dirty, room smelled like cigarettes, toilet water was yellow no matter how many times you flushed, and was surprised to find mosquitoes since it's enclosed and air conditioned. Front desk said they would respond to my inquiry about extra charges for wifi but never did. Wifi is already free so don't pay extra online, if offered. 1 star for location and another for the convenient breakfast box for our early flight."
"714.","sharan n.s.v.n","18","2019-01-21","2","Nice room and service but poor communication from such a reputed chain. The hotel is inside the airport and they wont let you go by bike to the hotel. You need to park your bikes at the bike parking and its a 15minute walk from there with no proper directions or shuttle. After a long walk with your luggage, the airport staff takes their own time to check you in and not bother to offer you shuttle service back to parking or suggest you the shortest route."

Juga dengan bau ruangan yg jarang terpakai."
"716.","Jack Dempsey","74","2017-01-21","2","The restaurant was terrible had the worst service none of the staff knew enough English to even understand what tomato sauce was, terribly slow service with the meals taking way too long! They had no coke no water and dirty served glasses. Even took way to long to check into our rooms. Rang up to get some dinner to our bedroom and about 1hr of waiting without having and service so we go down to where our Parents are having dinner and they say sorry we cancelled your order while we have already paid for it... Extremely bad service worst place to stay."
"717.","Jay Alex","210","2019-01-21","2","Communicating with the staff is next to impossible. I tried talking to the concierge about a days activities and they couldn’t begin to understand what I was talking about. Maintenace personnel needed in interpreter to fix a simple item. Bedding is ok, pillows are nice however the bedding should be upgraded to a proper duvet, remembering that a Duvet does not get tucked.

Pijatnya benar-benar buang-buang uang. Tukang pijatnya hampir tidak bisa berbahasa Inggris, jadi komunikasinya sulit dan pijatannya terlalu lemah.

"763.","Mrs Lobo","11","2025-11-21","3","The perfect place to stay if you have a flight landing or taking off at odd hours in Bali.

They also have nice restaurants and a rooftop bar that serves alcohol, great food, and live music."

We booked this hotel to give ourselves and extra few hours of sleep before our long flight. This didn't happen as the room was so hot even though the air-conditioning unit said it was set to cool 18⁰ no one in our family slept a wink. Really made our flight then unbearable. Additionally one of the housekeeping staff walked into our room without knocking whilst my partner was in the shower. He was shocked that we were in the room then proceeded to ask if we needed our sheets changed which made no sense as we checked-in only 20 minutes earlier."

Walking distance from the arrivals, but there was no signs and Google Maps provided no real help trying to find our way there. The pool area was lovely and the restaurant is pricey but open 24/7 if you arrive late. Breakfast was lovely. Reception was not manned when we arrived super late and tired, gym was only a room without aircon and only small weights, and our room could have used a proper deep clean. Closet doors were held together with tape."

Service is friendly all around the hotel. Room is not extra clean, there are a few spots I found on towels which is concerning to me. Breakfast is good but not great, I think you can get better food just outside. The 3 star rating is because I asked them to extend check out time by 1 hour and they wanted to charge me almost half room rate for that. Usually it is the right of the hotel not to extend free of charge, but given that I checked in at 3 am, and the hotel occupancy was apparently low, I expected some consideration."

Was greeted by a tray of disposed food at the entrance of our room when we checked in, not sure how that happened. Hair dryer had exposed wires. Shower area does not have a door, so the sink area gets wet after a shower. And as it is a airport hotel, need to walk to the domestic or international terminals to get a cab if you wanna travel."

Based on the price and the hotel category I would rate it as follows Cleanliness: Looks clean at first sight but rooms and carpet could use some deep cleaning. Breakfast Buffet is huge and had a lot of choices. Quality needs to be improved though. Looks are better than taste. E.g. Pancakes were tough, cake tasteless It is located directly inside the airport and it is very hard to get outside of the Hotel by foot. They should definitely provide a free shuttle to town. Even drop off at the Hotel by Grab is difficult. Wi-Fi is very slow All in all it is way to expensive for what you get."

We were tired and when entered the room, everything was like we had expected from Novotel Airport as this is not the first time we stayed here. We were glad as what we need is to rest and a good sleep before we start our day in Bali. But to our shock the toilet had a very strong urine smell like a public toilet and shower room drainage was clogged. It was not something we expected for the Novotel's standard of cleanliness. But we are now just too tired to call FO and ask the engineering to do something for the clogging and HK to clean the toilet. I truly hope this will be the 1st and last incident happen for guests, cause Novotel Bali Airport always have a good reputation..yet this time not for us."

"808.","Vikki Konemann","73","2020-01-21","3","Stayed as a transit for a few hrs for a late flight from Bali..rooms very clean...pool was good but as you would imagine there was a strong smell of aviation fuel in the air and noisy , buffet was very average and expensive for what was on offer $22AU approx and didnt include tea or coffee that was extra.I would only recommend a short transit stay as it is inside the airport."
